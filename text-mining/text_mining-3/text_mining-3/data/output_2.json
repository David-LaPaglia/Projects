Before arriving, I watched a number of travel vloggers, and a couple of \"things I've learned after X years in Korea\" videos. *No one* mentioned the pollution problem. Literally not one person. Currently I'm in Busan, and the AQI is above 200. The little cartoon man on the index is *purple*, and very unhappy. I hoped that leaving Seoul would alleviate the problem, but it has not.\n\nBesides the pollution, my stay has been very nice. But the air pollution problem is the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth thing you need to know before visiting Korea, and everyone seems to sidestep mentioning the issue. If you're a travel vlogger, or an expat living in Korea, you're not doing anyone any favors by not making the pollution problem exceedingly clear. The fact that I didn't know I was walking into this, and had to learn on the ground after I arrived, is truly baffling.",

I was a little surprised. \n\nAlso, a lot of people also don\u2019t care. You should see the stupid arguments people get into when someone in other Korea subreddits posts about the bad air quality that day. Some people attack saying it doesn\u2019t matter, everyone knows already, it\u2019s not news, no one cares, it\u2019s just dust, blabla.\n\nIt\u2019s also bad because spring is known as yellow dust season. It\u2019s not necessarily man-made pollution. There is sand coming from deserts in China due to the winds. So, this is just normal for this time period (you can google about yellow dust season).",

        "subreddit": "Bangkok",
        "text": "Every week we see plenty of posts about how bad Bangkoks air quality is. The air quality is certainly not good. Consensus seems to be that this is devastating to your health and if you live in Bangkok for decades you'll reduce your life span by 5-10 years. Comments in these posts offering a different viewpoint always gets downvoted so there's never any constructive discussion about this topic. I wanted to look into this some more and get some other perspectives on this. \n\nAs a starting point, the average lifespan for Bangkok residents is 78.97 years. Very close to top modern countries with very little air pollution. Why do they live so long if air pollution significantly reduced their life span? \n\nI also ran this query on ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini: \n\"If I live in Bangkok for 50 years. By how much am I reducing my life expectancy due to air pollution? \"\nThey all gave answers between 1-4 years based on various studies and research. Please run the query by yourself for details. Their answers seemed very credible with good sources. 1-4 years shorter life span is probably a lot less than most people would have thought. \n\nThen we also need to consider that most expats won't spend more than perhaps 2-3 hours a day breathing in the polluted air. You can also have air purifiers at home and at your office so that you breathe in close to perfect air most of the day. You can also mitigate much damage by maintaining strong health in general and you can wear a PM2.5 face mask while riding your motorbike in heavy traffic. \n\nIf you use the AI models to run a query with these factors as well, their response is that you'll reduce your lifespan by 6-12 months. But we could make a long list of things that most people do or don\u2019t do that reduces your lifespan by an equal amount or more due to non optimal, sleep, exercise and diet. But people prefer to complain about air pollution while their poor general health is what\u2019s going to take many more years of their life than what air pollution in Bangkok ever will. \n\nThe other part of this topic would be the immediate health concerns which is more subjective and personal. What I can say is that myself and the vast majority of people I speak to do not have immediate symptoms besides days where AQI goes above  150+, which is a small minority of all days of the year. Keep in mind that the average PM 2.5 in Bangkok is 25-30 which is categorized as \u201cmoderate\u201d and not \u201cunhealthy\u201d according to the AQI index. People seem to believe that Bangkok has the worst air quality in the world on par with New Delhi etc. Which is simply not true. Again, Bangkoks air quality is labeled as \u201cmoderate\u201d based on the AQI index. \n\nI'm not saying Bangkoks air quality is good and I'm not saying that there's no health implications. And of course it should be a top priority for the city to greatly reduce air pollution. What I am saying is that the health implications are a lot less severe than people think and that most people (not all) can do things to mitigate them to such a large extent that the impact on your immediate health is not noticeable and that your lifespan will most likely not be significantly reduced. \n\nEdit 1\nPlease understand that this post looks at air pollution from the perspective of the average expat here in Bangkok. Which is what this subreddit mostly consist of. Of course the situation is different for other groups of people such as local delivery drivers. \n\nEdit 2\nThere\u2019s several top comments here being upvoted saying that the AI models can\u2019t be trusted. The AI models did not come up with the life expectancy being reduced by 1-4 years. They merely quote studies and use tools developed for this purpose. For example, ChatGPT used \u201cThe Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) which is \u201ca tool that measures the impact of air pollution on life expectancy\u201d. It was created exactly for this purpose and it\u2019s used by the WHO, UN and many governments like the UK. Its conclusion based on Bangkoks pm2.5 levels was a reduced life expectancy of 1.75 years. All in line with other studies that the AI models quoted. Also in line with Bangkoks life expectancy already being high at 79 and clearly not significantly lower than other countries. \n\nSo no, the AI models didn\u2019t make up this data. Run the query yourself and you\u2019ll see the exact sources and models they used to conclude the 1-4 years of reduced life expectancy (without the mitigations of reduced exposure to outside air, air purifiers etc).

It would be possible for people to limit their pollution exposure in the few months a year when it's more severe in Bangkok, and most of the time pollution levels are moderate.  Not for motorcycle delivery drivers, as commented here.\n\nI've seen studies and research into impact of health on running in moderate or high pollution levels, and it's also not what one would expect.  Benefits still outweigh risks, up to a pretty high level, somewhere in that 120 to 150 index range (based on my memory of vague conclusions I read a couple of years ago, so only offered as a general indicator).  I don't completely trust speculative and limited study results either, but again I think there's something there.\n\nA family cousin just died of cancer, and when that comes up you re-think how low level risks map out.  He smoked, ate a bad diet, consumed lots of nutrient-empty, high-sugar foods, didn't exercise, lived under stress related to unemployment, and had unfavorable genetics, so to some extent he almost had it coming.
