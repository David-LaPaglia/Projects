I don’t care wether or not global warming exists tbh, I just think we should protect the environment. And not through government intervention because we’ve all seen how well that works.

We should be good stewards of the earth and let a competitive market push for innovation that leads to a cleaner future. Hopefully leading to cheaper cleaner energy for all.
I cannot dispute any of this. I even remember some of that as it was said or happened. 

I also remember the “hockey stick” temperature graph how it showed runaway warming was supposed to happen about 15 years ago. We’re like 8 degrees Fahrenheit below the projected temperature of that graph. 

I also remember “peak oil” which again was supposed to happen like 15, 16, 18ish years ago. Still hasn’t happened.
I believe I saw an old newspaper article from the 1920s that said that the world was going to end in 20 years from whatever the buzz word was then.

Many Americans feel we should protect the environment and I believe things get better all the time, though I was shocked to be behind a young lady who threw a plastic bottle of some juice out her car window. I grew up with the mentality that you recycle, reuse, repurpose and never throw anything out the window of your vehicle. We do need to continue to improve recycling. We have made great strives on toxic dumping, and manufacturing air pollution. One of the most important things that needs to be done is hold countries like China and India accountable for their ongoing pollution. America and Europe cannot carry the entire world’s environmental issues.
I'm old enough to remember Carl Sagan lecturing us about global *cooling* in the early 1980s.

And thanks to the internet, we can preserve [false and sanctimonious predictions like this.](https://i.imgur.com/TqWTTk8.jpg)
Yeah, ice age by the year 2000 was the biggest bullshit espoused by the environmental movement that we're still waiting for. 

It's that load of shit that started their loss of credibility way back in the 1970's.

They've never been right about anything. Ever. If they just would admit they hate capitalism and want to destroy it with their bullshit scare tactics, people might have more respect for them.

But no, they won't. Climate change is bullshit. They just want money to fund their communist agenda.

No thanks.
A large portion of the population actually enjoys being taxed to death because it’s for a “good cause”. 
They can’t get enough of the dire headlines and think that if we all pay more and more and more it will be magically fixed.  

Then they consume goods from China.

Climate change lunatics: 50 years of batshit crazy predictions

https://nypost.com/2021/11/12/50-years-of-predictions-that-the-climate-apocalypse-is-nigh/
I don't have an issue with climate change, I have an issue with giving the government more power to regulate and tax under the veiled disguise of climate change policy.
Late 60’s -2000’s nuclear power is evil and scary, hurray natural gas and coal … 2001-2010 if only we give  money to Gore’s carbon credits we can save the planet….2010-2021 only if we spend half the GDP on green new deal policies and super expensive electric Teslas… 2022 Tesla man bad like orange man !!!! Lets spend all the gdp on green new deal!!!!
I'm all for protecting the environment, however, the cry babies don't understand the amount of environmental destruction and pollution that results from making batteries. Clean air, water, soil is paramount. Paying carbon taxes to make the elite politicians wealthier is counter productive.
The US is responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions, says Bjorn Lomborg.

. Anyone know if this is true? ( I hate doing Google and getting 758 different answers.)

If so, China and India are the big players in this arena, not us. China is cranking out a new coal powered power station each *month*, and is planning 150 nuclear plants.

Poor nations want to industrialize to lift themselves out of poverty, and if that means emitting carbon, they're going to do it regardless of what US environmental whacko and European painting gluers do.

Climate change is actually real. It's A problem. There are many *other* problems  in the US  and the world that need attention. The world is not going to end in 2030 and humanity will not be wiped out by climate change.

The current "climate scare" is how dimbulbs like AOC get re-elected. CNN is using it to scare viewers into watching for views; they said so directly in the Project Veritas story. It reminds me of the antinuclear "panics" of the last century, which accomplished nothing except preventing new plants.

Cheers
Leftism demands two things in order to justify more government power: social victims and imminent crises. These things don't actually have to be true, but leftists will cry and scream about them anyways.
HOW DARE YOU!
I love this. I remember when it was all about “the hole in the ozone layer”.
**Europe is going to experience what global cooling feels like this winter.**
Here’s another one:

Or we'll let the little girl talk again
Climate change has always existed from the beginning of the Earth's creation. The very nature of Earth's climate is that it's always changing, and it's part of the world's beauty. And it's not as catastrophic as the fear mongerers make it out to be. Even if it was, there would be no government policy or carbon tax that could stop it, and we would simply have to adapt to the Earth's natural changes. 

I'm not saying that we have no impact on the climate, we absolutely do, but the world is too vast and complicated to make climate predictions by plugging a few numbers into a computer simulation. There are too many factors that the scientists wouldn't be able to consider, because we don't know everything there is to know about the Earth's ecology. There are too many variables that go unaccounted for, because there are too many forces at play for everyone to be able to take into account.
Oh for God’s sake. Please don’t bring out the Swedish wine muffin. I’ll go live in a cave if I have to. But no more wine muffin.
I remember in 2010-11 there was talk of Amsterdam and Venice just being completely underwater by the end of the decade.
Everyone should check out "Tony Heller" on streaming sites.
That God those Greenpeace guys saved us from all that
Climate CHANGE is real, however Global Warming… with these past few winters being nuts-stuck-to-the-deck cold…I don’t see it
[removed]
It's a religion.
This is not a radical opinion for conservatives to hold. You can agree that we can treat the earth better and strive for innovation to help accomplish that without forcing society into the dark ages and making us eat bugs.
Conservationism not climate alarmism
Here's my idea about how the government CAN intervene in a positive way.


1. Create a tax break/credit/deduction if you convert your grass lawn into a no lawn/natural yard.


2. Reroute fossil fuel and green energy subsidies for fusion power, carbon capture, carbon nanotube battery, and plasma gasification research grants and later subsidies


3. Encourage remote work by providing studies and rent assistance to companies that can transition a certain percentage of roles to remote.
Exactly. Humans are 100x better at adaptation than prevention. I believe in climate change but I don't believe its the dire apocolyptic event that everyone is screaming about.
Exactly. I don’t understand nuthugging corporations who cause irreparable damage to our environment. It’s the planet we live on and we should conserve it at all costs. 

There are other ways to go about it besides forcing people to drive electric. That comes through time and education. Not force.
> I just think we should protect the environment.

There is a massive difference between recycling, cleaning up rivers etc. (you know stuff you can actually SEE and has a clear impact)

and delusional ramblings that we have to somehow "save" the entire planet from some global threat that we've been told was gonna happen in the next 10 years for the past 40 years yet never happened.
My issue with the “climate change” is the fear mongering, lies, and vilification. Let’s clean up the air, land, and water. Let’s protect nature and natural beauty. They need to quit with the fear mongering, lies, and vilification. It’s not bipartisan.
>I don’t care wether or not global warming exists tbh, I just think we should protect the environment.

I think most people have zero issues using greener, cleaner methods for just about everything. The problem is affording the new tech or, understandably, not wanting to reduce quality of life.

For example, most people might be willing to switch to solar panels, but they probably can't afford to do so, and probably wouldn't be too happy if it almost meant reducing power usage (less gaming, Netflix, fewer xmas lights, etc), even if only at certain time of the year
It's cute you think this is about the environment.

This is about wealth and power transfer and controlling the population.
This has been my argument, with a slight modification.  That we are stewards over what God has given us.  He gave us Earth, so we should be thankful and mindful in caring for it.
That's what 100% of conservatives believe. But that has nothing to do with the hysteria and manipulation being cooked up by the technocrat, Marxist elites.
Global warming activism is bad for the environment. As we are wasting insane amounts of money trying to reduce CO2 instead of actual pollutants. We do not have infinite resources.

The conservative version of "Green" is called "Blue". Where the left is anti-human in their approach to the environment, Blue's entire focus is ensuring the environment is best suited for humans.
There is an entire layer of our planet called the carboniferous layer.

It would take thousands of years to even mine 1% of it.

We've barely mined a few square acres out of millions of 28 million just in Pennsylvania.
The math just doesn't check out.

The numbers published by the IPCC are made up by committee. 

ALL of the Global warming theory evidence is "adjusted" statistics.

There are no more hurricanes than 1800's.

Ski resorts are still open.

NY isn't under 30ft of water.

And with the thermal mass of the world's oceans there is simply not enough energy reaching the Earth from the Sun to create even a fraction of the alarmist scenarios "scientists" put forth on a daily basis.

The math just doesn't add up.

Basic science from the last 500 years.

It takes the same amount of energy to heat a gallon of water on your stove as to heat the ocean, (times the number of gallons of water in ocean).

The laws of physics aren't different on your stove.

If the Co2 blankie theory is true, it can be proven by calculating the energy absorption from the sun with different concentrations of gases.

Here's a hint, Mar's atmosphere is 95% Co2, and so cold it snows oxygen. 

Earth gets 1000 watts per sq meter. 

Mars gets 500.

400 parts per million does not retain enough heat to make a difference. 

If you have any "facts", post them.

There is not a single fact, or physical measurement of any kind supporting Global warming.

A theory so sound you need to exaggerate, falsify data, and outright lie to promote it.
Oceans don't feel any more acidic to me.
I agree.

Here is an example of things done poorly.  Al Gore pushed to ban incandescent bulbs in favor of compact fluorescents.  A lot of climate activists praised this.  The problem?  Fluorescent bulbs contain mercury.  I am willing to bet no one disposes of them correctly.

Fast forward.  We now have white LED's.  LED bulbs reduce power consumption greatly, especially in larger things like parking lot lights.  They also don't contain toxic heavy metals.  And they last longer.

The point is innovation solved how to make light that consumes far less power for the same (or greater) lumen output.  Exactly like you were pointing out.

We are starting to make fusion reactors with a net positive output for the first time.  That is the future of clean energy, not solar and wind.
Hockey stick graph has been thoroughly discredited but that guy still has a career.
There's no such thing as peak oil but now that "fossil fuels" are seen as evil, it no longer matters anyway. Even if we found huge lakes of crude under the Earth's surface, we'd ignore it because it's evil to keep using it.
Late ‘90s it was all about the ozone layer and the big ‘ol hole being caused by hairspray and cow farts. Alt-left propaganda then and now.
I'm beginning to believe that oil gets replenished from the inner core of the earth.
I’ve already survived 6 end of the worlds.
Doomsday prophets used to be in cults or crazies on the side of the road. They now run the Democratic Party.
Biblical times saw apocalyptical writers flourish. Some things never change.
And fear so they can introduce radical changes… you know, before it’s too late.
This is a weird conspiracy theory. You think all the climate scientists in the world are conspiring  to bring about the end of capitalism and institute a new world order?
We need to differentiate between “Climate Change”, which is real and has been occurring from the beginning of time and “Man-Made Climate change” which is a money grab gimmick.
Pollution is gross and legit. Climate change is horseshit. It’s a busybody, bored people who want to “save the world” tax.
Yes, but leftists will claim that per capita makes the US worse. Even though there are vastly poor/under developed areas of China and the rich urban areas. It would be like rolling Latin American into her per capita GDP numbers.

They have no interest in fighting climate change when the biggest producers of CO2 have made it clear they will not be cutting emissions.
World wide steps where taken to reduce the hole and guess what? it worked. NOAA and NASA satellites monitor the area and weather balloons are used in the ground. This argument is the worst possible argument against global warming. A documented issue, cause found, steps taken to take these products off the market and real, substantial results that are easily measurable
Yeah that patched long ago which was thanks to the early 1900s. But people still gotta say that it’s a big thing like it’s NOT the smallest it’s been in 150 years.
Yeah I remember that too, I remember looking up at the sky as a kid and being like “I don’t see a hole anywhere” haha
I think you mean whine. A wine muffin sounds kinda nice, TBH.
Cuz why? What makes you think it is? Cuz some “expert” who gets paid to tell you it is real, tells you it’s real?
Companies make more through corporate real estate than a tax credit would provide.
>1.	⁠Create a tax break/credit/deduction if you convert your grass lawn into a no lawn/natural yard.

The overwhelming majority of people cannot maintain this and so all it will accomplish is the spread of invasive species.
There is a reason why they pivoted and called it climate change, cuz it's always changing.  The real question is if humans are actually influencing the changes, which has not been proven.

The earths climate has been changing for billions of years and will continue to change with or without humans.
Not to mention that even current battery technology (with all of the cadmium and other nasty things in them required ) is still overall worse for the environment than any petroleum-fuel-based at today's standards. But there is innovation as well; didn't I see somewhere that the lithium battery inventor has come up with a new design that is maybe 10 years from production?

I'm not sure electric cars (as they exist today) are the answer. But I'm certain that as our understanding increases we will find new ways to use our availableaterials and make something that doesn't require those materials. Demanding we all use this environmentally-dubious tech by law to soothe someones mania about the environment is not the answer. 

I agree - give us time (which we definitely have, so long as we don't start a global nuclear war) and we will find a better way.
*50+ years
It’s funny to me how the people who scream Global Warming and Climate Change also want to plow down hundreds of acres of trees and forests to put up solar panel fields that do what….draw more heat to the earths surface. I have no problem with keeping our planet cleaner and picking up trash out of the water when I’m on my boat and things like that, but there’s no way you can tell me that cutting down trees and putting up fields of solar panels at high costs that are going to be taken down in 25 years at end of life are somehow better for the environment.
If they could have used the over $1 Trillion spent promoting Global warming to stop throwing trash in the water, that would be great.
So then you ***don’t*** believe in environmental preservation?
Exactly my reasoning
[deleted]
Climategate from 2009 showed Michael Mann was a complete hack. You had all the climate scientists at the CRU completely befuddled of where his graph came from. Pretty much Kyoto was coming up in the late 90's and politicians were demanding actionable evidence for their massive climate accords. Climate scientists had no direct evidence (as climate is very complicated and finding direct signals is difficult), so Mann created a paleoclimate reconstruction that was at odds with climate reconstructions for 3 decades before that point.

The turd made the Medieval Warming Period and the Little Ice Age disappear. Such a hack. But he got his PHD off of it and massive grant month for decades since. The politicians got what they wanted, a scientist willing to sell his credibility for massive amounts of grant money. Shortly after that scientists across the field started just falling in line.
And yet, discredited people still have a platform… How many times do we see scientists, politicians, bureaucrats, athletes/actors, etc; get stuff so blatantly wrong and still have a voice/following? Why? Zero accountability and the concept of “my person says the thing I like and my worldview aligns with this thing, so no matter how wrong they are, I’ll support them!”
Oil is a "Fossil Fuel", it's ancient carbon based life forms. Coal is also that. Ancient trees from millions of years ago semi-fossilized.
You have a valid point there
No it doesn’t but we do need to use less of it. I think we should leave oil for futures generations to have plastic. But it doesn’t mean climate change is real
So you are about 20 years old? /s
Doom-freaks.
Not all who call themselves scientists are truly committed to the scientific method. They’re human beings who need to pay the bills, want to rise the ranks of the bureaucracy, get grants, prestige, and invites to famous actors’ parties. They’ll say whatever their sponsors tell them to say. 

That’s why any real scientist who *is* committed to the scientific method who dares to call bullshit is bullied and shamed or outright censored.
Climate scientists the world over do not agree in Catastrophic Climate Change. What they agree on:

- Humans have an impact
- Many think humans are driving the bulk of modern climate shifts.

In the United States alone, since Obama's time,  tens of billions of dollars have been thrown at climate change. It is the most highly funded science from the government outside of defense R&D. You would have to be brain dead to work in the climate science field, or related, and not run along with the narrative.

Look up Dr. Judith Curry. They effective ran her out of Academia for not agreeing with the politicians demands on the subject. 

Also look up the the overwhelming consensus on climate change before and after Kyoto. Suddenly with massive political pressure and lots of money you see an entire field flip on the subject. As in climate scientists throughout the 80's and 90's were widely against any concept of catastrophic climate change (global warming).

What you consider "Climate Change" is a political movement and was never scientific. It's a pseudo science akin to eugenics. And yes numerous highly educated and intelligent people bought into eugenics spread by the Nazis. Most doctors and academics were on board for it.
Yes. Greta Thunberg recently even just said it. Most of AOCs “green new deal” was welfare programs. If the earth is going to overheat and become uninhabitable in 12 years you’d think she’d consider leaving out the “free child care” and “living wage for those unwilling or unable to work” off the bill. That’s the equivalent of after 9/11 if George bush had put in “ban abortions” and “build a Mexican wall” into the crisis legislation that was signed. You don’t put politically objectionable garbage into a bill if it’s an actual crisis. You put that in when you want to scare people into giving you things off a fake crisis
Or they're all simply full of shit.
Except that’s not what happened.  They found out the ozone layer shifts on it’s own.  When the hole in the north gets bigger , the hole in the south gets smaller, and vise versa.
Historical patterns show climate changing all the time. It’s a gradual process, it’s how the earth went from a tropical climate with mega flora and fauna during the age of dinosaurs to an Ice Age. Yes other natural disasters factor in: a meteor hitting the earth causing massive volcanic activity which cooled the earth. 

The thing is: it’s all a pattern that has happened before humanity, during humanity and it will continue to happen AFTER humanity. In the speck of years we’ve been industrialized we’ve barely contributed a negligent amount of change. 

Our history as a species and civilizations is but a grain a sand in the history of our planet.
That's the beauty of it, you don't have to maintain anything, just let nature grow whatever it wants to grow there and don't interfere with any cutting or pesticides
Everybody believes in environmental protection. Wilf ain't wrong.
Billions have been wasted by the government with no results. The waste, fraud, and abuse are staggering.
And he sued journalists for calling him out for it.
I’ve never heard of this guy. I’ll do some research, thanks! Any videos, documentaries, links you might suggest? Thanks again.
Don't forget bacterial mats!
We need to differentiate between “Climate Change”, which is real and has been occurring from the beginning of time and “Man-Made Climate change” which is a money grab gimmick.
[removed]
It should be obvious from the name that the green *new deal* would include welfare programs. Also no one thinks the world will become uninhabitable in 12 years. We’re already seeing some of the economic fallout from climate change. Food and energy inflation caused by drought are the first that come to mind.
Any peer reviewed sources?
Yes they filled it with Flexseal.
Sorry, I thought you were referring to the mAnMaDe ClImAtE cHaNgE.

I happen to agree with you. It’s natural and has been happening since the beginning of time.
I was really into this as a hobby in from 2008-2014 (reading scientific papers, IPCC, reports, etc).. I don't follow it much anymore. /r/climateskeptics probably have people more up to date and with readily available links.

If you can find websites with "Climategate" still hosting the emails it was incredibly informative. Pretty much we got an inside look at what numerous climate scientists thought for over a decades. They also released their paleoclimate reconstruction models, which showed obvious rigging of data sets to ensure a "warmer" present and colder past.
Who could forget!
