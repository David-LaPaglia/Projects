An underrated moment in an amazing video: "I don't think I ever want to talk to any of those people." Wow, taking a brutal stance against carpenters.
The tone with which he says, "That's Cameron. He's grows trees, then cuts them down, and builds thing from them." is absurdly hilarious. Like he's acting like he's killed him with a zinger, when he's just explaining a normal part of a particular occupation.
He came well prepared. Only spoke his answers. Never said more to justify them. And most importantly, never let his emotions interfere and give them the rise they want.
That was a smooth move staying silent, presenter ended up looking like such an idiot
Mike Graham, the man that hates carpenters and grows concrete.
Guys, how can I grow concrete?! I gots me a fuckin pool I wanna build in my back yard! If I can grow my own, I can save so much! Anyone got YT links that are legit?
He won that argument without saying a word!
The loser uploaded this clip to his twitter.

He seriously thought this was a slam dunk. Growing concrete. He's genuine.
That's absolute gas that is. You can see that he knows he's got him when he stays dead silent and just smirks after a few seconds.
The presenter has the same charisma as testicular cancer
my man sat there and let that idiot marinate in his own stupid comment. marvelous.
The presenter was on Twitter for a while after this still trying to argue that you can grow concrete and that technically he's right. Amazing

‚ÄòI refuse to have a battle of wits with an unarmed opponent‚Äô - Cameron the Carpenter
I will sleep well tonight knowing how furious that fucker was after making a complete ass of himself
Mike Gram is stupid
Brilliant, marvelous.
Cameron knew he won and he knew he didn‚Äôt need to say a thing more. Goddamn!
He‚Äôs upset with carpenters?
It's almost like you can replant trees and make new trees.
I wish he would have pressed him on how to grow concrete
We Americans have a term for people like that: they‚Äôre called ‚Äúdumbshits‚Äù
It‚Äôs amazing to see him cut through the bullshit with a single sentence. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a sustainable building practice.‚Äù No arguing facts, opinions, or emotions. It‚Äôs simply what it is, it‚Äôs researchable, and it‚Äôs (no pun intended) concrete.
Please, please tells me this is some kind of ‚Äòdroll English Humor‚Äô.

Because there‚Äôs literally no way that can be real?
Cheerio
This has Rupert Murdoch all over it.
That half smile like: "...Bro, think about what you just said."
What an utter child. "I never want to talk to you again!"
i love how the activists face just changes like hes holding back laughter right as he says "yeah you can"
‚ÄúConcrete doesn‚Äôt grow‚Äù

‚ÄúYes it does‚Äù -Embarrassed reporter 2022
Do people really think the timber land owners just cut the trees down and salt the earth so nothing grows again?   Why would they not practice sustainable forestry so they can do business indefinitely?   Harvesting trees is regulated and all replanted.  

People really are stupid
Is it just me or does this guy remind anyone of Lewis Prothero from V For Vendetta?
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll, you can‚Äôt grow concrete‚Ä¶.‚Äù
Production Director, ‚Äújust fucking cut‚Äù
"You can grow concrete" lol
I understand why he doesn't want to talk to any of those people ü§£üò≠üòÇüò≠
Everything you do will create CO2, only thing that doesn't produce CO2 is the moon.
It‚Äôs like a scene from Don‚Äôt Look Up
This is hilarious
"Mike Graham defends ‚Äòyou can grow concrete‚Äô comments" https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/news/mike-graham-defends-you-can-grow-concrete-comments-298557/amp/
I will never skip this video, too good
Cameron just made that guy look lower than a leprechauns nutsack
This man fought the good fight to keep from smiling
apparently this guy wouldn‚Äôt have talked to Jesus
"I don't think i *ever* want to talk to those people"

I wonder why üòÇ
What a blow hard. Looks like the UK version of Rush Limbaugh. What a bad human. Good riddance. He once condemned parents who had a child with a drug addiction, all the whole he was wolfing down OXY that he has his house cleaner get. another piece of shit hypocrite that is part of the problem.
‚ÄúBrilliant. Marvelous.‚Äù at the end absolutely fucking killed me lmao.
Oh wow would you look at that, its a Carpenter and a Tool!
Fresh off the concrete tree
Hates carpenters yet loves jesus LOfuckingL
The most devastating silence I've ever witnessed.
That dead look after his dumb ass said " you can grow concrete" was epic.
Mike you are an absolute ducking loser!

Cameron - please keep kicking idiots like these in the nuts
Mans thought a concrete plant was a real ass plant with leaves n shit
The way he just holds his laugh at the end is just too good
He grows trees, and then cuts them down and then builds things out of them.

Oh, you mean one of the fundamental practices that helped build civilization as we know it? Yea, seems like a pretty handy career.
Lol. He rage quit his guest.
The subtle head shaking, smirk and silence.

This guy just destroyed that mf without making an effort
He did the best possible thing there.  


He didnt say anything when the guy said something stupid. Just let it hang out there.
I need him to explain what trees grow concrete cause I've never seen wild concrete before.
This cant be a serious thing‚Ä¶.this HAS TO be scripted‚Ä¶.right? Right guys? ‚Ä¶..right guys?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..
Do people really still not think global warming exists?
Top knob
UK WTF is going on across the pond.
And what is the frame of the fat guys house made of?
Brilliant. Marvelous.
Is that the British equivalent to Alex Jones?
Gardening Tip: Concrete plants love wet, sandy soil mixed well. Plant them in late February or after last frost. They are ready to be harvested in the hot summer usually late August. When the fruits have harden completely that's when you know they're ready.
I just planted a concrete bush in my backyard.  Checkmate
Well as a 7th generation concrete farmer I have to say I agree with his assessment. My family is the number one grower of concrete and all other families have inferior concrete. Don't even get me started on wood as a "building material".
‚ÄúThat was ‚Äòscientist‚Äô Nikola Tesla, he apparently builds revolutionary mechanical inventions, and then somehow transmits electricity wirelessly, to then power those inventions. Brilliant. Marvelous. I don‚Äôt think I want to talk to any of those people.‚Äù
Hahaha
\*Describes what carpenters have been doing for millennia\*

"I don't think I ever want to talk to any of those people."
What?! I‚Äôm growing cinder blocks in my backyard. Pssh, ‚Äúcan‚Äôt grow concrete.‚Äù Whatever man.
Still satisfying to watch.
That can‚Äôt be real. It‚Äôs one of those brilliantly subtle British comedies.
I like this Cameron dude.
Legend
Jesus was a carpenter, too. Supposedly.
> That's Cameron. He's grows trees

No he doesn't. That's an arborist.

> then cuts them down

Also an arborist.

> and builds thing from them

Third time's the charm!
It's weird how nowadays you have absolute morons, defiant of reality, but somehow aloof in their lack of intelligence. Trump and his zombies come quickly to mind.
‚ÄúThat was Cameron, he grows trees, cuts them down and makes things out of them. I‚Äôm Mike Graham, I think concrete is something you can grow.‚Äù
I was hoping for something else when Cameron said ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs regenerative, you c-‚Äú
Anyone who would criticize anyone for "being a climate change activist" at this point is just an uninformed old person. Even if there wasn't a major crisis at foot, there's something admirable about people wanting to look out for the planet. Like "oh you developed a material that's less harsh to make? That's really cool I hope you do well" instead of "you're a stupid hippy. Here are my truck nutz."
"Next we have John who is a _farmer_ he plants seeds then digs them up months later. He claim its a _sustainable practice_ and that humans have been doing it for _thousands of years_ "
Oh i can't describe how intensely satisfying it was to see this old fart realize he's been had.
It's always the silence that gets them. I've legit practiced it, even on friends that I know are right. I ask "is it?" to which they'll respond "yeah" and if you sit there long enough, you can see the doubt fill in their eyes like "wait, am I wrong?" I of course always tell them I'm just messing with them and then ask more questions, genuinely interested.

But for real, most people don't like silence in a conversation. It makes them think and sometimes they realize what they said was dumb, such as in this case, at which point they will fold.
I watchted this video whilst watering my concrete plants. 

The stifled smirk on Cameron's face combined with the silence is golden tho, i love it
I don't think anybody has pointed out the obvious yet. 


The guy on the left is a cunt.


Probably the same guy who'll chat shit about a society with free healthcare, free education and affordable housing. 


Yeah heaven forbid we strive for what benefits people less rich than you you glorified ogre.
I want to see how he grows concrete
Another corrupt politician selling out to the Big Concrete Growers.  Make ya sick now, donnit?
The trees that were cut down get made into the shit that will be standing on concrete foundation where the trees were thus not allowing any trees to grow there
I feel like this encapsulates how the rest of the world views the utter moronic right wing nut job movement that has gripped the world. It‚Äôs soooo cringe and nothing but an attempt to make others look less than their worth. 

Hope they all fuck off‚Ä¶ and go enjoy a coffee and take a deep breath. I feel like they need a minute to collect themselves. The rest of us are exhausted from your talking.
Face it, redditors, you don't like Mike Graham simply because he's not your typical Ken-doll newscaster. He's not "the norm". He's not "handsome" or even "presentable". He's not "witty". He has no "charm" or "appeal". He's not "up-to-date on current events" or even "possesses a general knowledge of basic subjects". People will say he's"willfully ignorant". He's not "polished" or "prepared". When he  eats at restaurants he doesn't "use silverware" or "wipe his face" or "wash afterwards" or even "the next day". So you just keep on getting your opinions from the sorta blow-dried bobblehead fake newsers that don't "make people queasy" and "frighten children".
So many people today are proof of the validity of the Dunning-Kruger Syndrome. Too stupid to know how stupid they are and too dense to be convinced of it.
So Murrica doesn‚Äôt have a monopoly on stupid right wingers.
"How is it sustainable if you're killing trees"

Someone doesn't realise we've been using wood as our primary building material for literal millenia.
In case people don‚Äôt know this extra bit as well:

Trees absorb carbon dioxide, use that carbon to build the structure of the tree and store it for years. When you build with that material (compared to concrete and steel) you use less carbon resources to do so and it traps that carbon for decades to come. Finally the trees that grow in its place continue to carbon scrubbing process
We've been growing concrete ever since the Romans discovered the concrete bush. Duh!
Can anyone tell me whats interviewer saying in the beginning ? What are you glued to ?
