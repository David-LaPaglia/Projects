No joke, when climate change gets worse, Conservatives will blame everyone else for not doing enough. Even after they block all our efforts.
Have you tried redefining the fire to something that polls better in a focus group? Like freedom heat or patriotic combustion?
Frank Luntz is a bad person.
Well Frank, what could you have done differently?
GO RAKE THE FOREST, BITCH!
It's his own fault. He should have spent more time raking.
It’s ~~unfortunate~~ depressing/infuriating/insane/unbelievable that assholes like this are going to drag the rest of us with them as they do everything they can to force their way towards a climate collapse.
Sending concepts of thoughts and prayers.
I prefer the term "domicile oxidation event," Frank.
Isn’t Frank Luntz the person who encouraged the term Climate Change over global warming because it didn’t sound as bad?
Frank Luntz is the guy that got everyone saying “climate change” instead of global warming, IIRC
Cuntz is one of the worse offenders. He was instrumental in the rise of Newt Gringrich in the 90s. F him.
Jump in it, Frank. Like you’re a virgin and it’s a volcano.
Go back in time and don't help the GOP deny climate change.
Solution: privatize firefighting to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Licinius_Crassus , he will customize a low cost fire protection for you /s
You want advice, Frank, go back in time and tell your younger self not to be such a soulless POS
Part of the problem is that when GOP policies turn to shit, and they always do, they simply point at the Dems and say "it's their fault!".  Every fucking time.  The party of personal responsibility takes no responsibility  for their actions or positions.
My absolute favorite is how they’ll say climate change will take 500 years to be a problem, while ignoring the fact that once it starts, it’ll accelerate all the issues much more quickly. “Dog, once the soil dries up, it’ll be the dust bowl 2.0, but much worse.”
hmm....we could just Nuke it
You can rest assured that’s not happening because that’s a hoax. Enjoy!
Uh, crap from 2017?
This will be up there with Murdochs house if it ever goes up.
Article from 2017. Doesn’t make it less true, but makes me a lil sus of OP’s motives.
My favorite is when these corporations that are responsible for a majority of the environmental damages, release a campaign urging us all to do our part.
A train load of leopards made the trip to Canada recently.  After voting for a right wing government that drastically cut funding to fire monitoring and fighting, they had to watch a huge swatch of their most beloved National Park and the town that attracted tons of tourism burn to the ground.  Lots of crying happening over that.
Poor frank he has only been convincing ppl to let it all burn while they get rich for so long. Never occurred to him HE would be apart of said burning… lmao poor guy do we tell him to finally believe in climate change or is he rich enough to move? Oh wait literally everything is flooding or burning…. 🙄
Frank Luntz deserves climate misery far more than the average person for his service to evil. He's probably trying to blame it on Al Gore.
This is the same guy who built a scale replica of the oval office and the Lincoln bedroom complete with a copy of Lewinski's dress
For what it’s worth, he at least has admitted his mistake and has made efforts to promote action on global warming.  He also doesn’t consider himself a Republican anymore.
Don’t worry about it Luntz.  Just think of all the value to shareholders that has been created in the last hundred years.  That will warm the cockles of your dried up heart.
This guy lives in a multi-million dollar house in the hills paid for by human misery.
He should take Ben Shapiro's advice: just sell his house and move.
Frank Luntz is responsible for SOOOOOOO MUCH of the current Republican horror show!!!!  Leopards should be eating his face for the rest of his sad pathetic life.
People should stop trolling that poor man and give some constructive comments, like:

> build a time machine, go back in time and don’t vote in the assholes that made that possible.
did you try increasing the rake budget? or turning the giant faucet?
Surely Luntz could word that more positively and enduring to voters.
As someone who is not in California but always sees thi stuff on the news, genuine question, how the fuck does California have enough damn forest LEFT to keep having these fires?
He could rake his yard.
That was seven years ago.
The solution: Controlled forest fires. Yeah, climate change makes forest fires way worse but something else we can do to help stop forest fires is controlled forest fires to give trees a chance to lose the insane amount of oil they build up when we actively try to prevent fires.

Is he an idiot for panicking about something caused by his party? Sure, yeah, but forest fires are more complex than just climate change, more than us actively trying to prevent fires.
Lantz should just focus group a positive sounding name for the fires.  That's his solution for everything else.
I'm glad people have called out Luntz after years of letting him manipulate us into this pre civil war/Handmaids tale world.
Just remember - when MAGA types claim that environmentalists changed from saying "global warming" to "climate change" because the globe somehow stopped warming, remind them that it was actually [GOP Strategy](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2003/mar/04/usnews.climatechange) to make that change.... by famed strategist, Frank Luntz.

But Luntz does get a little bit of credit for [admitting his mistake](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/21/frank-luntz-wrong-climate-change-1470653).
Why do so many conservative leaders live in Blue States?
Well, 40 years ago when you were laughing at scientists for suggesting carbon dioxide induced global warming, you could have used that energy to, I dunno, work AGAINST pollution?
Have you tried raking up the leaves?
Should have raked the forest better.
We don't need no water, let the motherfucker burn

Burn motherfucker, burn
My advice stay in your home til it blows over.
Have you tried raking your lawn? 🤔🍂🍁
Pray harder. Maybe you’re praying wrong?
Karma's a bitch, and she's in heat.
Not the first time the leopards have feasted on Luntz. He had a stroke a few years ago. During COVID, he was high risk and wanted everyone to get vaccinated. He did a focus group to try to convince republican anti-vaxxers to vax. He entirely failed to change anyone’s mind. He had been too successful at teaching republicans to believe crap and reject the truth
It starts with "Go" and ends with "Yourself." Figure out the middle word on your own, Frank.
Luntz is LITERALLY the guy who worked to change “global warming” to “climate change” because it polled as less scary.
It fits with the pro-Putin GOP alignment. Global warming, for example, will allow for the opening of the Northwest Passage, which could become a lucrative shipping route, and allow for the exploitation of Siberia's natural resources. Russia is under significant economic pressure due to sanctions. As a result, they're likely to prioritize short-term gains from exploiting their natural resources, including those in Siberia and the Northwest Passage. This means that being anti-climate (postponing action) change aligns with Russia's current goals, as they seek to maximize their economic benefits in the short term, even if it means delaying climate action. By opposing climate change efforts, the GOP is inadvertently(?) supporting Russia's strategy to reap short-term rewards, despite the long-term consequences for our planet
Frank Luntz gave a keynote at an ad tech conference I attended once in 2002. I loudly booed him much to the shock of the people around me. Apparently they didn’t know what a huge asshole he was.
Frank, use your wigs to snuff out the fire.
The lake of diamonds are on fire bro! 

Thoughts & Prayers should work for you.

Crazy old photo btw.
Thots and players. You have to just get over it. I did!
I am told* you can take the fire out of the pollster but you can’t take the pollster out of the fire.

* i made up
Unrelated but I remember my parents driving us past that tower on the right all the time as a kid. Wild.
WE DON’T NEED NO WATER

(at least at that address)
Tell frank he can call it an approaching natural landscaping change and when his house burns down it call it a new dwelling opportunity. That might focus group better for him.
I would have replied “thoughts and prayers.  It’s all part of God’s plan, just let it be.”
Fortunately, Mr. Luntz, there is something you can do. First, you’re gonna need a time machine…..
I'm sad that all that, now waste is polluting the poor Ocean and will obviously kill sea creatures. The chain of destruction will go faster with the loss of some underwater ecosystems.
Thoughts and prayers

*puts on fire lapel pin*
Even now the jackass asks “what can I do to save _*my*_ house”… selfish till the very end.
Thoughts and prayers
Now THIS is LAMF!!!
Honestly, couldn't happen to a better guy.
Hey Frank.

You're supposed to sell your house.
Why didn't he volunteer to rake the forests?
2017?
Why is this post from 2017
"Let's say for sake of argument that 70% of LA hills burn to the ground. Don't you think those people won't just sell their houses and move?"  -Ben Shapiro, probably
People should get what they vote for. Let him burn.
Start raking.
What you do is you put the whole house up on wheels and drive it away from the fires.
For an honest answer the main cause of house fires is burning embers hitting the roof. Make sure your gutters are clean, soak the roof corners that embers might get stuck in, remove any foliage overhang.
Vote for Dems. Not that they’re doing much better but at least they’re not denying the existence of climate change.
Don't look up
Pray.  

Oh, don't forget to think about it also.



Thoughts and Prayers are all you need.
California is run by Democrats.
I actually appreciate republicans on this one. Democrats are talking big about climate change, but have actually opened more land to oil drilling than Trump did, and have yet to ever do anything that would substantively change climate change.

At least republicans are honest about not giving a shit instead of greenwashing everything and pretending to give a shit while doing nothing meaningful like democrats. I guess they at least acknowledge climate change. That's gotta count for something I guess.
1. Luntz was instrumental in helping GOP get in power   
2. As a consequence of GOP power, climate change got far worse  
3. As a consequence of climate change getting far worse, Luntz's house is about to burn and he's crying for a way to not have his own consequences happen to him.
My favorite is the people with beachfront property that is literally sinking into the sea because sea levels are rising that are mad the government isn't bailing them out.
[deleted]
Anyone remember last year when FOX News claimed that the fire smoke from the Canadian wildfires spreading into New York wasn't harmful? Because I do...
They already are. My cousins dumbass wife is posting shit about how the weather is getting worse because of solar farms ffs.
My guess it will be around 2050 before conservatives will start to blame everyone else for not doing enough to stop climate change because that is when oil will supposedly run out and I can only imagine that oil companies will have ran out of money to pay politicians to deny climate change and most people will have switched to electric cars and won't be as dependent on their gas cars. Then, and only then, they will look up and see the condition of the world and come to the conclusion that it is in bad shape and needs to be fixed.
So, standard operating procedure?
“Well why didn’t you stop me from blocking your efforts?! You did this!”
It's worth pointing out Frank Luntz's role [specifically](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/21/frank-luntz-wrong-climate-change-1470653) for those who may not understand who he is.
They do that shit with gun control, too. “Well, there are now too many guns in circulation to do anything about it. Let’s just have more guns. Hopefully a good guy* gets one this time.”

*Doesn’t matter if good guys have a gun, the violence and chaos will be just as bad.
Why is there so much overlap between how the GOP operates and abusers/malignant narcissists
> Conservatives will blame everyone else for not doing enough

No they won't. They'll blame black/brown/foreigners like they always do.
Glance over to the uk for a case study, the centre party has been in government 4 seconds but the consequences of everything the right wing party did for 15 years is already entirely their fault.
