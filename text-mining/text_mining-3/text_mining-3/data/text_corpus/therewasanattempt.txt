Earlier, James also posted his delight when the tents of homeless people burned with the hashtag #KILLEMALL" so I wish his house had burned down with him in it.
Family guy was üíØ about this guy
MAGA. Not surprising.
What an absolute piece of shit. He literally cried about his house on CNN and politicized it. That was bad enough. The fact that his house survived and he won‚Äôt correct the record makes him a despicable, hateful man.
So the only feel good story of 2025 so far - that James Woods's house burnt down - is fake news? This year is gonna be worse than I thought!
Pathetic just like his rapist cult leader
I wish someone would just pray him with fake tan and dump him in Palestine     Give him a life lesson.
It would be a shame if someone made him not a liar.
Ok, now extra fuck this guy
Is that a joke? Don‚Äôt you have to see your house destroyed before you burst into tears? What a classy guy!
Remember when he lied claiming he was on a plane and watched the 9/11 hijackers doing a ‚Äúwalkthrough‚Äù?
It‚Äôs not a miracle. It was public servants putting their life on the line, while he spews garbage. I can‚Äôt believe they named a high school after him.
Breaking news!!! After surviving the fire, someone poured gas, and lit James Woods house on fire, and it's now burnt down. /s
He is a piece of shit, and I am boycotting all of his work.
I was in the audience of the Tonight Show shortly after 9/11. James Woods was the guest and he went on an insane rant about how he would nuke the "towel heads" in the Middle East.  It was one of the most hateful and vile things I have ever seen.

But Ozzy Osbourne was the musical guest and he was awesome.
If anyone deserved their house burned down, it is him, preferably with him inside.
MAGA will always lie. Always.
What an insult to all the poor people that did lose their houses or property. Scum bag.
Quick, anybody got a lighter?
James Woods is flame retardant.
Don‚Äôt let facts get in the way of owning the libs! /s
James Woods was irrelevant 7 days ago and he‚Äôs irrelevant now.
He has long been irrelevant and is seeking g attention.  He is washed up.
James Woods has always been trash. Always.
Be a real shame if it coughs a stray ember after the fact
Fuck james woods
If someone doesn't burn it down first, firefighters will come and flood it
![gif](giphy|OhKdC3HeOu0yk)

We surprised about this guy‚Ä¶?
A bad actor.
Wow. What a sick bastard?!
It was obvious he was lying when he gave the interview to CNN sitting in his house
Ooh! Piece of candy. Ooh! Piece of candy. Ooh! Piece of candy.
There‚Äôs so many people I know who is seeking sympathy even though they are off so much better than 99% of the families who are seeking help just feeding and housing themselves
Who is he?
He might have genuinely believed his house burnt down. As someone who has been through something similar and family who went through it, the information that comes out of the burn zone is incomplete and even incorrect, it takes time to know for sure if your property survived.

He also could have just be straight up lying for his own agenda, I don‚Äôt know I am just saying he might not have been. We will see how he responds.
There are so many people out there i have never heard of that are apparently fameous or well known.   
And when i do disocver them its usually them being idiots. i love getting my news from memes :p
Garbage
Once again‚Ä¶fuck James woods
Perhaps he would be happier in Texas or Florida.
Where's the hit squad for cunts like this?

What a piece of shit
House burns down? Not an act of God, must be governments and firefighters fault.

House survives fire due to great effort on firefighters behalf? Thank God, it‚Äôs a miracle
He's probably gonna start victim-blaming those who really did lose their homes now that he's been outed as a liar.
Another entitled fucker whose movies we can all skip forever. Make him disappear.
James Woods is a tool.
He‚Äôs a horrible racist.
This guy should be shipped to the other end of earth he's garbage
This guy is a POS
I truly do not get it. Did he really think this story couldn‚Äôt be verified? What an insane thing to lie about, especially so very publicly!
He was very very good in "another day in paradise", a great underrated drug movie, where he plays Mel, a real scumbag junkie thief who isnt afraid to kill other dealers, and mentor youth in real larceny.
It was a very reaÃÄistic and believable performance.
Maybe he just didn‚Äôt know, they evacuated, so one could presume it burned down, but then later found out it was as still there.  Why does everyone immediately jump to condemn people before the full story is out?  Did I miss something?  Was he caught lying? Did he admit?
Pretty sure he was told it was because every other house around him was.  Not crazy to think he actually thought it was but Reddit is literally legacy news now where they just push one view and downvote anyone that doesn‚Äôt abide by that.  I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll get a lot of upvotes and a lot of, ‚ÄúI had to look up who James woods was‚Äù, or ‚Äúhe‚Äôs such a loser actor‚Äù but it‚Äôs just a fucking hive mentality. 11 people have died from these fires now.  Someone should be accountable for such a bad response.  Loser.
Move the F out then
Maybe someone should perform a true-up. 

Perhaps he could be present for the event.
I mean.... it still could burn down.... Especially if he filed any sort of insurance claim.
Someone should make him not a liar
Just a little taste of what life feels like for everyone in Gaza. Prick.
i dislike him for being a pos. still, i kinda felt bad for a guy losing his home. nope, just a pos. fuck you, james woods.
As a Brit I only know who this guy is through Family Guy.
America are u ok
Newsom about to be rich suing other rich people ~~left~~ right and right for defamation.
Oooh a piece of candy‚Ä¶Oooh a piece of candy‚Ä¶
The idiot right strikes again.
What a horrible person
Thank you for this post. It's the same thing I felt...
I mean, it's James Woods. This is who he is.
What the fuck was he thinking?  That he could hide his house behind a curtain and no one would notice?  Did his neighborhood burn up and he just assumed his home went up too?  None of our makes sense other than 'maga'.
Everyone loves blaming Newsome, but of course no one pays attention when the budget votes come in
maybe someone should unmiracle it
Does he have mental health issues, dementia, or has he always been a narcissistic asshole?
Guy is a douch, but he didn't lie. House was in a neighborhood that reportedly all burned. Turns out portions were unaffected.
 My ancestors went to Europe to put fascists like this guy down.
Can someone start a petition to officially cancel this guy?
They are all liars I know let's not fact check them anymore
He blame ‚Äúleftist Hollywood‚Äù for being blacklisted but in reality they saw what kinda horrible person he was
Not that I condone it, but wouldn't it be just comeuppance if someone lit his house on fire?  

I doubt I could muster a tear for that.
These fires are not due to a changing climate‚Ä¶
I mean, there is a way to make him not a liar?  would be great if he was still in it.  a true patriot, sacrificing for the MAGA Cult.
Wouldn‚Äôt it be hilarious if someone burned his house down?!
![gif](giphy|U5hvUeqw10e0U)
He FELT like it burned down. That's what's important.
Thats for noodles!

![gif](giphy|PTSIHXfd6dUiI)
I'm so fucking tired of the bad guys winning.
No words‚Ä¶..the lowest of the lowest.
I like how it's always people's fault when things go bad, but it's a miracle from God when things go right.
This guy is a piece of rotten trump shit
Who's this asshole anyways?
I think the people of Quahog RI need to rename James Woods Regional High School after this debacle.   The people of Quahog deserve better.
Maybe he evacuated, assumed the worst and got lucky? Just throwing it out there‚Ä¶
An actor acting like a MAGA poster child, odd‚Ä¶
Dang too bad. I know it‚Äôs really sad and causing a lot of destruction and hardship for many people, but I can‚Äôt help but feel the SLIGHTEST bit of delight at what‚Äôs turning out to be Wildfire Mangione 2025.  Please don‚Äôt hate me.
It's James wood, a total of three people would care what he says. Even Maga.
So now arson is climate change? Got it.
Guys‚Ä¶.James Woods is an ACTOR. Of course he is gonna go on TV and do something like this for A MAGA-troversy.
This girl made 2 different posts about it? That's a bit much
Toilets aren‚Äôt flammable
I bought that hook line and sinker 

What a little shit
It‚Äôs almost as if he did an interview thinking it burned down, and then later on found out it didn‚Äôt. Holy shit, this is the first time in recorded history this kind of uncertainty has ever happened.
Pos liar? Maga of course
