The problem is that these things will happen gradually and too slow and seemingly insignificant for us to react to. An earthquake that kills three thousand people? We will send rescue teams and journalists. A 69% average loss in the abundance of mammal, bird, reptile, fish and amphibian species in the last fifty years? Shrug.

There will also be secondary consequences (like fugitive movements, which will lead to political destabilization, which will lead to armed conflicts) that will distract us and keep us from tackling the causes in the future.
We re already experiencing it. The price of sugar and cocoa have skyrocketed due to bad crops from bad weather. More will come and will affect others weather Related commodities(all food staples). Expensive food will always kill marginal people and the make everyone suffer from higher cost of living.

No serious source claims that.

Science is not looking into a crystal ball. Actual scientific research comes with error bars and estimats, it has ranges of outcomes.

There is no single predicted outcome, there is multiple estimates and ranges and papers about what is more likeley to happen at specific places. 


Thats why there is best and worst case estimates.

The best case is lile 1.5deg and a cupple of feet water rising. The worst is that that causes the gulf stream to stop leading to a lot colder climate in europe. 

Noone in science claims 100m waves will hit the himalayan mountains.

Noone is expecting extinction.

But a cold climate and bad harvest can lead to war.
The Governor of Florida recently signed a bill banning the phrase "climate change" from state laws. That will not stop the many barrier island communities, like Miami Beach, from being inundated by rising sea levels. It will not stop the heavier seawater from undercutting the freshwater table in south Florida, turning the wells, used to keep all of those golf courses and lawns nice and green from becoming uselessly salty  Worse yet, it will not stop vast tracts of suburban communities dependent on septic tank systems from becoming uninhabitable.

Don't go signing up for any mortgages on any barrier island beaches on the Atlantic coast.  North Carolina's outer banks will be reduced to a memory.
The main problem is surely going to be agriculture. We already suck at sharing our resources, if we keep going there simply won't be enough food for everyone. Hundreds of millions if not billions will starve as a direct consequence of climate change.
> when we're really going to see the big impacts and most people will begin to experience the consequences

10-15 years ago? We're living through it right now, and it only gets worse every year.
Please don't take Reddit comments as the final authority on something this technical.
Impacts right now include rising insurance rates for one.  We are paying $1200 more than last year for car and home insurance.  This increase is despite the fact we have clean driving records and never made a claim for auto in the 47 years we've been married.  As for homeowners we had a claim 14 years ago for hail damage and another claim 35 years ago for for minor smoke damage.  With huge areas damaged by wind and flooding (I'm looking at you, Houston) , devastating fires burning entire communities (Paradise, CA)  you better believe we will all be paying for it with increased premiums.  We see these types of devastation several times a week, in the US and around the world, rather than a few times a year.  

Oh yeah, I forgot to mention we in MN are ALSO paying higher gas and electric to support fucking TX and their BS policy to remain "off the grid".
Climate change aside (because I have no idea of the cause - only the impact), for one reason or another, in my area the temperature in the summer has been increasing every year over the past couple decades. What does that mean for me?

1. ‚ÄúHot days‚Äù used to mean 98*F. Now they mean like 102*F. The difference feels staggering. It‚Äôs very obvious to me that even if the temperature permanently rises .1*F, that‚Äôs contributing toward something very serious over time. 

2. I keep a huge garden in my backyard. I have noticed that I have to work more consistently against the heat than in previous years so that my plants don‚Äôt burn.

3. Most AC units in my area seem to be manufactures for sub-100*F temperatures. Mine got old and gave out recently. I had to replace it and it was crazy expensive. It makes me worry, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the impact of 100*F+ summers going forward?‚Äù Then I start thinking ‚ÄúWhat other things have been manufactured to limits we teeter on?‚Äù I could see consumer/household level infrastructure being an issue over coming decades.

In other words, .1*F is a lot when permanently added, and I‚Äôm not worried about extinction level stuff so much as all the practical stuff on the way there.
Climate change is already affecting societies worldwide, but we will not have 10ft sea level rise or billions of casualties. Please go to Google Scholar or look up the UN's climate change reporting.

Climate change is a major issue, probably the largest our species is currently facing, but it isn't a movie apocalypse. It it's a serious of changes over multiple generations that lead to a world that is harder to live in, but not impossible. As with most issues, wealth affects how significantly it will impact you. 

Wealthy people and citizens of wealthy nations will be less affected as their wealth, personal or national, will be able to fund adaptations. Poor people, especially those who live in poor nations are already facing these issues. Just look at events like the Arab Spring which have been partiality spurred on by climate change and environmental collapse. 

Tldr; climate change is already here. It will suck, but it isn't the end of humanity, civilization, or even your way of life.
The planet will survive. Life will survive. Humanity will survive. Some species will die. Some places will become crappy places to live. Future humans will think we were idiots.
Having lived on a boat for 1/2 of my adult life and all but 3 of the last 15 years, I can tell you that sea level has already risen.

They're welding extensions on the tops of the pilings so that the docks don't float off of the tops.

Sometimes the ramps down to the docks are ramps up now. Slightly. They never were 20 years ago.

Surf spots have changed dramatically in some places. Beaches are washing away in some places.

A few very low islands in the south Pacific and the Indian ocean have been evacuated.
It's deeply concerning the amount of misinformation in this comment section. Goes to show that most people genuinely don't even understand it, let alone it's impact.
We're not!  Ice ages are MUCH more dangerous for humanity than a potentially slightly warmer climate.  If you look at the ice age cycles, we're still emerging from the last one.  But there have been times the Earth had no ice caps at all, and it was fine.  When the [Cambrian Explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion) of life happened, Earth was far warmer (and had much higher CO‚ÇÇ).  The Earth climate did not "run away" to be Venus-like; it nurtured life and stayed very habitable.
I work in climate policy which doesn't mean shit, but I've seen way too many stupid people say things like "we should do something so long as it doesn't cost us anything".  That's the most ignorant short term thinking that keeps me up at night - how can we ever really do anything in a capitalist democracy.  They'll be giving out tax credits for buying EVs while the earth sizzles.
Realistically?  Nobody has any idea. 

All previous predictions of climate related disasters have proven to be wrong. That being said, there are a lot of weird atmospheric/weather related things happening. Do the best you can to take care of your part of the earth. That is all you can do. Don‚Äôt take any of the predictive science to be reality. Nobody can tell you what the seal levels etc are going to be in 50 years.
The worst case scenarios have already been avoided. Outlook isn't as pessimistic as news media make you think, but continuous effort is needed. Kurzgesagt has two or three videos about it which I find convincing.

Things will happen slowly, but not all over.
Winter in the Midwest really sucks !!!! üòâ
When the rich and powerful elites stop buying seaside island mansions, you'll know things are getting serious.
Mass migrations of people fleeing climate change have already begun. Next up: food shortages.
Don't buy waterfront property.
Very...
The elitists like Zuckerberg and Obama are recently buying or building oceanfront properties in Hawaii and Florida.  They're certainly not worried about sea levels.
AI will probably kill us within 15 years so then it'll be their problem to deal with.
I was told we all died in 2006 due to massive floods.
Earth has been cooling for thousands of years. We're coming out of an ice age. Warming is expected. CO2 increases as a result. All good things for life. 

Scientific consensus is useless. You must support a hypothesis/theory with evidence. e.g. Global warming - We have decades of fear mongering, but no evidence. All predictions failed. 

Earth is far safer today than ever with respect to people injured/killed due to weather events/catastrophes. Super hurricanes is a silly concept.
The water in the Gulf of Mexico is so warm that any tropical storm gets supercharged.   It's absolutely true that you can't show that any particular hurricane, or any severe weather event, was caused by global warming.  It would make sense that the number of hurricanes would increase, but even that's hard to say because other changes, like a shifting jet stream, might tend to suppress hurricanes.  However, there is no question that the tropical storms that do form are stronger, because the water is warmer.  A couple more storms like Helene and Milton, and people aren't going to be able to buy a house on the Gulf Coast because mortgages and insurance won't be available.
Well. They used it to steal 41 billion so far.

https://www.outkick.com/analysis/billions-dollars-climate-change-research-went-missing
Oh yeah we are way past the tipping point probably. Noone is 100% on the when, but everyone agrees it's not if it's when at this point. However, good news alot of us will be dead before the really bad shit hits so there is that.
It's pretty bad,  not Hollywood bad,  but still bad.  
Extreme temperatures will be outside of our capabilities in cast parts of the planet.  
Extreme weather will result in flood and then droughts. 
Sea level rises will overwhelm low-lying land.
We are already living,  more or less,  at the human limits for these things. So increases in temperature or weather will just overwhelm entire countries. 

It's already too late to fix it. We are locked in a cycle that takes years to change.  And no-one wants to change anyway. 

Most of this will happen first in remote countries where you don't live or travel to.  But you will start to notice when coffee gets very expensive, And some fruit or vegetables aren't available. Then people will start to migrate to cooler,  richer countries. Then things will really start to affect us in our rich first world countries. 
Supply chains will break down.  Most of the raw materials we rely on come from marginal countries and when they break down,  and the people move on to the less marginal countries,  where your goods are manufactured, and they break down,  well,  then it won't be long before we are really affected. 

TLDR its very bad but happens incrementally, so it is hard to notice, and it will be too late by the time we do notice.
For the past few years Japan and Europe have been seeing hotter and hotter summers.

Europe is situated higher north than most of North America, so its summers should be relatively cool, but now they‚Äôre seeing summers in the high 90s. Japan is regularly seeing days push into the 110s.

I remember in the winter we‚Äôd usually have 1-2 good snow storms where we‚Äôd see 10-12 inches of snow. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen that since 2016. If it does snow, all traces of it are gone in a few days.
Super-hurricanes: Depends what you have in mind with that term. Strong hurricanes are definitely getting more and more common, and that trend is likely to continue.

10ft sea level rises. It's the right order of magnitude, but it's a bit much. The Giec projections predict the sea level in 2100 to be between 50cm and 1m above their level from 1900, depending on the scenario. But while that's a big deal in a few coastal areas, it's not that impressive, is it?

Mass casualties on the scale of Day After Tomorrow by 2035: Nope. That's just silly doomsday prediction. 2035 is very close, and climate change is a very gradual process.

Life will muddle on as it always does: Ho, yes. There is no question that life will go on. The question is rather under what conditions for humans, and with how many species going extinct.

There may be some loss of bio diversity: There is no "may" here. That's already happening. It's a certainty.

>What's the current scientific/expert consensus

You should read the latest Giec report (https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/downloads/report/IPCC\_AR6\_SYR\_SPM.pdf). That's exactly what it's for. The entire point of this report is to have plenty of scientists from various fields contribute to provide a full picture of the issue, while making it understandable by non-scientists (like politicians). They provide a few scenario, from optimistic to pessimistic, to describe how bad it is (and how bad it isn't). Even this "summary" is a pretty long read, but it's well structured to allow you to follow along, and skip the parts that may not interest you (a lot of it is about what can be done). It's definitely the closest thing from a scientific consensus that is accessible to everyone.
The thing that happened recently with the singapore air flight can be attributed to climate change due to the air simply being too warm.   
So we'll start seeing more and more "unlucky" events. But people will always shrug it off for a reason or another
Here's the consequences of climate change.


A lot of people will die.¬†


Who? Good question. Not the rich people. Not the ones who can afford land in unaffected areas, who can pay for ever increasing food.¬†


It will kill the poorest of the poor, the weakest of the weak, the oldest of the old as it already has started doing.¬†


Some others Will die. Some rich people's planes will be downed in freak storms, some will be hit with freak floods.¬†


But the crux of the problem is an economic one. Most of the real negative effects of climate change, you can pour money on to put out the flames. Simply fly away from flood prone areas in the summer, install water cannons for forest fires, setup desalinators to water your greenhouse. But climate change is fixable worldwide with today's technology, it's just not *profitable* to do so.¬†


So what happens next?¬†



We'll see. There are ways that it can end without economic collapse, technological advances that can make fighting climate change profitable, governmental oversight and regulation etc. But for now, under the current system, this is what will happen.¬†
The world has always changed. Ice age didn‚Äôt happen ‚Äúthanks to humans‚Äù . The planet is always in a constant change
On a scale of 1-20?

Like, 3. Maybe 4.
We all already irreparably screwed, for so so many reasons. Once the biosphere starts to collapse, it becomes exponential. I may get a little off the direct topic of climate but let me elaborate:

We‚Äôre looking at mass extinction. Global fertility rates are dropping in ALL mammals, including humans. Insect and bird populations have been plummeting for years. 

Over farming without proper crop rotations are ruining the soils. Over use of pesticides is making us all sick. Famine and drought are coming. 

The world is heating up. As this happens the permafrost will begin to melt.  It will this release thousands of tons of co2 into the atmosphere, it will also release a host of ancient frozen viruses and pathogens, that modern humans likely have no immunity against. 

Microplastics and PFAS chemicals are in the water, in the air, in the soil, in your blood, brain, and yes, microplastics are even in your testicles. These chemicals in your body may change the hormonal balance in your brain. They may also cause cancer, heart attacks‚Ä¶ well anything bad really. The funny part? Scientists actually can‚Äôt pin down exactly what microplastics do, because they can‚Äôt find a control group. That means scientists literally can‚Äôt find a single human who doesn‚Äôt have microplastics in them. 

Also let‚Äôs not forget big manufacturers like Tyson meats be illegally dumping toxic materials into rivers! oh, and there is also lead in our drinking water confirmed. 

Honestly I could add several more paragraphs to this, but my poop is over so I gotta wrap this up.
extinction level event .. and we are on pace to do in 200 yrs what the permian extinction event did over the course of 20,000 years.

if we don't make radical changes, then radical changes will be imposed upon us.

does that clear it up for you?
Let's just say that science once predicted that we'd be in an ice age by now. The things that might happen are endless.¬†
Just go to r/collapse they should get you up to speed.

There are people over there who've memorized every stat, scenario and cause for climate change and they can give a  much better answer.
There is lots of [data](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2021/04/25/wheres-the-emergency/) showing a basically flat long-term trend.
If sea levels are indeed going to rise, why did Obama buy a house on a tiny peninsula?
We're not , it's BS .
You better take up yoga so you can be limber enough to bend over and kiss your arse goodbye. We are on the cusp of the 5th global life reset event. We will not survive it.
Not at all. Bunch of people will die. There will be a revolution. We will probably murder bunch of rich people who were gaslighting everyone to keep profits up at cost of everyone just like when they were selling fuel with lead. And then change will happen and we will adapt. 

Reason why we do jack shit is because this is a boiling frog problem. Due to that we argue with idiots if we are in fact cooked instead of doing something about it.
10‚Äô sea level rise was supposed to happen by 2012 according to Al Gore, if it does raise, move inland 
I have a question if all these so called climate experts believe this is going to happen, why do they all have multi million dollar homes on the beach?
>when we're really going to see the big impacts and most people will begin to experience the consequences?

brother have you lived under a rock the last 20 years?? jfc how can one be so oblivious
Even beardy weirdos living in their mother's basement will be fucked. It'll be that bad.
Not at all. The people in charge fly private jets all the time and most have huge super luxury homes on the ocean.  If it were a real issue, they would act like it is.
Fugitive? I think you meant refugee.
Earthquake doesn‚Äôt happen thanks to humans
90% of the Georgia peach crop was lost last year due to an unusually warm period during winter.
Depends on how far out you look when you‚Äôre talking about extinction. Some of the projections on feedback loops are looking pretty terrifying. At the very least, it‚Äôs collapse of society stuff.
We also have no idea how certain things will develop, like clouds. Clouds have a huge impact on climate and temperature increase, and we literally cannot accurately predict them. I read an article about it a few years ago and it was the most depressing thing I've ever seen about climate change.
i'm expecting extinction and in fact it is already under way.

mainly because i'm looking at geologic time scales.

permian 2.0 is what i see coming.
We are feeling it in the keys. About two or three weeks ago the water temperatures were nice and slightly cool for this area.  You go into the ocean today and it‚Äôs like warm bathwater.  

Someone on Reddit the other day posted a NOAA heat map of the Atlantic ocean  in the areas that hurricanes develop from when Katrina hit New Orleans and a heat map of the same area of the ocean today, of the same area and it has quadrupled in size. 

I do not look forward to this years hurricane season.
It has to effect everyone , not people 10.states over, or another country.  

People are in for a huge wake up call I'm sure in 50.or so years, if we have that long
I thought it would be a fun discussion
The only correct answer. And even when someone else claims authority look at the raw data yourself. 

Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome.
Exactly.
Yeah, this right here. Follow the money. Number-crunchers doing the cold hard math is a direct impact already, but Hollywood doomsday shit isn't going to show a bunch of people losing their insurance or having homeowner insurance skyrocketing by 300%.
I haven‚Äôt noticed the summers being hotter but I haven‚Äôt shoveled snow like I used to. The winters seem different where I live.
I have noticed it being more cloudy and stormy here in Oklahoma, followed by the heat, clouds and high heat suck worse, than just clear skies and heat.
I always ask myself I wish I had some alien buddies with better materials to make shit than we do
First, plenty of climate predictions have come true - Exxons original calculations from the 70s (that they concealed from the public) were shockingly accurate. (https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/12/exxon-climate-change-global-warming-research)


The basic math behind levels of carbon to temperature is very well validated, but it's It's impossible to predict precisely in the long term mostly because it depends a lot on how strongly humans respond. We just don't know how much new technology and new policy efforts are going to affect carbon/methane emissions.
3/4 Australians get skin cancer over their lifetimes
I was going to say this. I'm 36 and constantly heard about all the disasters we would face, and yet they never came. I'm very bored of all these doomsday prophecies now. Yes, climate change is happening, but it will be slow and barely anyone will notice. 
And not dismissing our impact, but the world has gone through this process many times. Heating up, ice age, heating up, ice age. Life got through it then, it will get through it now.
Humans have pumped so much water that we changed the earth's axis of rotation. We are incredibly powerful.
Do super hurricanes feel silly now?
I just feel obligated to point out that predictions 30 years ago are coming true _today_. You‚Äôre misinterpreting that older models had less data and computing power. Or in layman‚Äôs terms, it was harder to make an accurate prediction. 

There were 3 main predictions based on projections of 3 main factors. Consistent rise, gradual rise and drastic reduction of CO2 levels. We ‚Äúfailed‚Äù the consistent rise, the prediction overshooting reality by a fair margin. That‚Äôs the one that gets thrown around as scientists failing. It was deliberately the worse case scenario. We also failed drastic reduction. Because we never did any drastic changes, so our temperature is higher than our predictions. Again, that was expected to be wrong. Best case scenario. 

But the one we‚Äôre actually close to? The one that predicted a 1.2¬∞ increase by 2020? The one that recognised that our CO2 output would gradually rise and cause severe effects on our climate? That‚Äôs the one we hit. And the deviances are literally just lack of data which when plugged in continue to accurately predict our predicament. 


The ice age ended a little under 12,000 years ago. Data for the last 2000 years puts a temperature variation of +/- 0.2¬∞. Direct record for the last 300 years has us actually below at an average of -0.2¬∞. 100 years ago we jumped to 0.3¬∞. 20 years ago we were 0.8¬∞. Today we are 1.2¬∞. We are making a demonstrable impact. You cannot hide from this. The longer you and others like you do the worse it gets. We need to change.
> alot of us will be dead before the really bad shit hits

  
yep, it's our kids or their kids that will have to deal with the worst of it. 

all the more reason to try and make changes now.
Yes, but v if the Atlantic currents as disrupted, Europe could get very cold.
Thank you for the link to the report, after exam season that's my summer read to relax!
I feel bad people actually believe this fear-mongering.  Nothing you say is even predicted to happen, you pulled it out of no-where.  You are clearly just fitting climate change into your pre-concieved economic ideology.  The IPCC only predicts only around a 1-3% negative gdp impact over 75 years.  Total, not yearly.  Whatever solutions you recommend would be more expensive than the actual economic impact.  You are either lying here or just ignorant, I hope its the latter.
We are not looking at mass extinction.  There is no evidence for that.
It's three times more elevated than the expected sea level rise by 2100. You could have googled this yourself easily.


Also, liberal politicians are the ones who want to try and minimize sea level rise, so it would be a bit hypocritical if he chose a house location based on the assumption that his own party's climate policies would fail, wouldn't it?
hyperbole like this only funnels people into climate nihilism and people thinking there is nothing we can do so why bother. Humanity will survive anything, we are too widespread and adaptable. Society and structures as we know it.. well that's up for debate
Why did Hawaii get scorched and the rich offered to buy up their lands????
This is r/nostupidquestions not¬†

There is truth to what you say. But most of these people are narcissistic and don't care about the future after they're gone, so they're happy to live it up today and let future generations suffer the consequences.
"Politicians are incapable of acting short-sighted and always have the best interests of all in mind" is a wild claim, even for a climate change denier
Ah yes, that's what I meant.
That's irrelevant. My point was that humanity is great at reacting to acute emergencies (man-made or not) but not at battling lingering problems that get gradually worse over time and you can't point a finger at a certain date where they happen.
fracking
Yes the worst cases are collapse of society, but none of tese cases or predicions are realy scientific studies. Scienge wont even define what colaps of society means.

And thats still not even close to extinction. Killing all humans on the planet is a whole other level.
The ice caps have melted completely, several times that we know of. The polar bears are thriving. Something tells me most things will adapt, as they have for MILLIONS of years. Extinctions and new species are part of change. See Wooly Mammoth.
So what you're saying is clouds make it hotter, so in the future it will be more cloudy like blocking out the sun cloudy?
That sounds mote like pop science. Ofc we can not predict any chaotic system at 100% accuracy and clouds are turbulent air flows, they are like any gas or fluid chaotic in nature.

But that does not mean we cant do reasonable estimations about what will happen in te future to these systems.

We can predic weather quite good, and its pure chaotic.
It absolutely DOES effect everyone now. There's just a large portion of the US population who are ideologically opposed to believing climate change will impact them, so they blame something else for stuff like rampant wildfires, every year being the hottest on record to date, massive heatwaves that knock out the power grid in Texas, the polar vortex collapsing and brining frigid arctic air as far south as Mexico, etc.
I don‚Äôt know where you live, but last summer had some of the hottest days I‚Äôve ever seen in my life where I live. We also had a bizarre event where like 2 years worth of rain dumped in a few hours and flooded part of a major city.
Yeah, months of snow in my childhood has turned to 2-3 hefty snows all winter. Not sure why, but I definitely grow crops in my garden for an additional month or two each year now.
Fair enough. Other scientists were predicting an imminent ice age at the same time.  I think we are saying the same thing. 

Realistically - we don‚Äôt know. 

Unfortunately, we have political parties paying for disputing data so it is a cluster of misinformation with realistic data mixed in.
[removed]
That is unfortunatly never going to happen just from countries like China, India and Russia refusing to agree with pollution reduction measures. Also at this point we already went over the edge. Think of it like rabies, once you start showing symptoms it is too late. Well we definatly showing symptoms...
I actually do some research into the effects of green gentrification, which is the correlation of green infrastructure that combats climate change to gentrification. The professor I‚Äôm working with has published a paper regarding this: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10511482.2021.1944269

It looks into green gentrification in Philadelphia by first creating a Vulnerability to Gentrification index and is then given a Pearson coefficient value on how correlated green infrastructure is to pushing out poor and/or minority groups. It is not a prediction of green gentrification, but rather a study on how census tracts have gentrified over the course of several years. Using this, we are using AI to hopefully predict green gentrification, which is a very real issue. 

If you are statistically literate, I encourage you to read the paper since it will perhaps clarify some misconceptions you have about how this affects people beyond mere GDP, which is a very superficial understanding of climate impact on lower socioeconomic classes.
Google Scholar how many species go extinct a day. The rate is accelerating at an alarming rate. The coral reefs. The acidity in the oceans. We are already in the early stages of a mass extinction event. There are overwhelming amounts of credible evidence to support this.
There is evidence for that.
