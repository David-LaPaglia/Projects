Yes Nuclear would have been great if people were not scared of it, and if it had all happened 60 years ago. 

But people are, and we didn't. So we should finally move on, now that renewables are magnitudes cheaper and quicker than nuclear, and storage is on track to make up for the intermittence problem.
How can you say it was the fastest and most efficient way when you have no comparison?
This account is very weird. He has made like 20-30 recession/economic and political fear-mongering posts over the past 3 days.
This chart is bit to easy, like if would compare a declining birth rate to the declining Stork population. If you put both graphs in a chart there seems to be a relation while everyone knows there is none
This post is very misleading, since it only shows the change in emissions, not the emissions themselves. Most other European countries would look similar here.
Your graphic doesn't support your claim. Here is a graph for CO2 per capita of Germany.

If you look up Germany with the end of nuclear power, it has the same if not slightly higher negative change in CO2 emissions. 🤷‍♂️
France is Nuke heavy, but they are also wind and solar. It’s not one or the other it’s the all hands on deck approach that wins.
DIdnt France need german energy because all the nuclear reactors where overheating and they need to invest a ton of money to repair them?
Even if NPPs are a good way to produce clean energy - we don´t have the time to build enough new ones and the old ones are getting more and more expensive. 

We can build a huge amount of solar and wind power in the time we build one NPP and the energy is most likely cheaper.

So as long as there is no fast new super NPP we should focus on renewables and storage technology.
Yes the US should have been more willing to build nuclear plants. Still the US should build more nuclear plants.
isnt it extremely subsidized and otherwise super expensive energy?
You’re making a jump in logic there… of course CO2 dropped. That says nothing about nuclear waste or if co2 is the sole contributor to climate change.
I love how the far-left shat themselves in this thread saying solar and wind power is better while also proving that it is, in fact, not better, by linking Germany statistics that clearly show they have smaller CO2 per capita change (roughly -43%) than France. 

why do you hate nuclear so much? it is much more efficient and objectively better than wind and solar power, at least for now. idk if you can see that but you're actually anti-green and pro-global warming
War seems to be even better

There are multiple reasons why nuclear energy is bullshit.

1. Without substitutions it is expensive af. About 40 cents for 1 kWh. 
( and no it does not get cheaper with time, the last 3 remaining reactors in Germany did run since the 80's and produced the most expensive electricity on the marked before they got shut down) 

2. It is unreliable. France had to import electricity from Germany because their rivers didn't have enough water to run their power plants.

3. The already existing nuclear waste is a problem for 40.000 generations.

4. Nuclear Power plants use fossil fuel, with the current consumption there is about 60 years of nuclear material left.

5. Fukushima and Tschernobyl.

6. Nuclear Power plants are constantly targeted by hackers and with the exponential development speed of Ai it is only a matter of time until one is having a meltdown.

7. Building new plants takes alot of time which makes the technology they are based on outdated before they produce their first kWh of electricity

You want nuclear energy? then build photovoltaic plants. The sun is basically a big fusion reactor
Look at other EU countries. Their charts look similar. Most European countries lowered their per capita emissions a lot between the 60’s and 90’s and they have extremely different energy sources.
Part of the lower emission can also be caused by the oil crises. And obviously a change in things like heating. Coal heating was pretty common until the 50’s or 60’s. Another part can be the huge change of population distribution. A lot of Frances rural population moved to urban areas. Especially the Paris metro area. Living in an urban area needs significantly less energy. (E.g. for heating and transport)

Pretending that NE is the reason this happened is definitely too simplistic.
Sure that must be the reason. And maybe you did not know, most Nuclear plants were out of service, and Germany has to export electricity to France in the Summer. Not only because of maintance issues, but also because of drought: no way to cool the plants without water.

And you completly disregard some of the most important thinks, like our ultra-right winged AFD:  
Nuclear fission is not magic, you need fisseable material for that. Mining that is expensive and quite dirty (will be in the statistics of some other country), enriching is also not quite cheap.  
Then of course the nuclear waste issue: Sure, do it like some other countries, and just burry it! Out of sight, of of mind. Just some problems with that: In Germany, for instance our right winged CSU wants nuclear power, but NO nuclear waste in Bavaria... Also keep in mind most of our fission material came from russia, who is paying A lot for disinformation to destabilize.

No, nuclear fission is not super mega great as some to make us belive it is. It is by no means cheap, it is fucking ridicously expensive. But, to hide the costs, often losses are simply socialized, while earnings are privatized, much like with fraking:  
Create a company and do your dirty shit. When you want to stop, just go bankrupt. The Taxpayer will have to pay for the decade long and ridicously costly removal of the plant and take care of the waste.

But take a look at the UK, and their new fission plant: so FUCKING expensive, you could build enough renewables for that price to create much more power without the waste!

Note, Germany has already 50 % renewables in the mix in the years median, in the Summer it reachers far over 70 %. If politics did not block and were not corrupted by lobbys of gaß, oil and nuclear, we could have 100 % now very easily and could have used the surplus money for electrical infrastructure and energy storage.
Show this at /r Germany maybe they can make something stop this no sense of solar painels in country with less sun then Antarctica
I will say what I will always say, when people talk about nuclear energy: It‘s a solution, but an emergency solution. It should be as little and as temporary as possible.

Why? Because you have to trust humans. Even worse, you have to trust humans and institutions. You have to trust workers in the power plant to not make grave errors, to not be distracted or be overconfident. You trust your government and companies to not cut any corners for personal or other gains and to not cover up problems. And that for both building and maintaining the power plant over a few generations and the disposal sites over many generations. You also have to trust other government and actors like terrorist to not try to blow up your power plant and your own government and companies as well as the working people again to not have any of the faults already mentioned and keep the power plant and waste safe so it‘s protected against terrorists and other governments.

Personally, as much as I truly stand behind our democratic governments in the west I think most government need to be closely monitored to not fuck up building a public toilet. So let‘s try to fuck up building renewables as much as we can before we consider to fuck up building nuclear power plants.

Germany doesn't look much different
Well where do you put the atomic waste, for like, forever?
However, the whole truth is that nuclear power is incredibly expensive without subsidies. Without subsidies, even in France, a kilowatt hour of nuclear power costs over 40 cents, and this does not even include the dismantling of the power plants in the future. Yes, of course, nuclear power is low in CO2, but it is the most expensive way of generating electricity. For comparison: One kWh of wind energy costs 7-11ct.
By the way OPs statement, that Frances decision to switch to nuclear was the fastest and most efficent move to fight climate change, is (possibly) wrong.

By comparing Frances CO2 emmision per capita at their peak in 1973 with 10.4t/c (t/c stands for tons per capita) to their current emmisions in 2022 with 4.6 t/c we get a yearly reduction of 0.118 tons per capita.

Meanwhile Germany (I took Germany because OP rambled here about "Germany ideological decisions") had an emmision peak of 14.3 t/c in 1979 which lowered to 8 t/c in 2002 which makes a yearly reduction of 0.146 tons per capita since their peak. 

  


So to OPs statement:

>German ideological decision to close its nuclear power plants has been the dumbest environmental, geopolitical and economical decision since WWII. Prove me wrong.

seems to be wrong. Since Germany has a larger yearly reduction of CO2 per capita than France since their emission peak.



Here is the source I took the number from: [https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co-emissions-per-capita?tab=chart&country=FRA\~DEU](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co-emissions-per-capita?tab=chart&country=FRA~DEU)
DIdnt France need german energy because all the nuclear reactors where overheating and they need to invest a ton of money to repair them?
It really was, yes. When it happened 60 years ago. We dont have 60 years anymore. Stop the coping and do what we have to do: Invest into renewables.
What is this nonsense post? You make a correlation on a graph that doesn't tell us anything about CO² sources, but only the amount per capita. For all we know, the reduction could also be because of population growth with stagnating emissions or the complete shutdown of steelworks and chemical plants. This post is more like a propaganda piece rather than something useful.
Nuclear energy produces electricity not gas and 50% of german heating is gas heating. So the gas heating problem in winter cannot be covered by nuclear power. The demand for electricity is covered in germany it is just the distribution that is lacking. Expensive renewal of the old nuclear power plants won't decrease the price for electricity and is politically not feasible. 
In winter france has to import renewable electricity from germany because many of their power plants are dilapidated  and some have a shortage of cooling water. Unlike germany france has mostly electrical heating.
Yet
just to create the next problem for future generations
There’s a chart, and there’s a headline.

But is there a correlation?
And what about the TOC? I read that maintenance cost exploded in France.
It’s still increasing at 200%
What an absolute bs post
Cocorico
god nuclear is so based
Money is energy.
It feels really unethical to post to a sub masquerading as a more scientifically objective sub and using a title that is wholly unsupported by your data.
The fastest and most effective thing to influence CC is to get China and India on board.
Offsetting your carbon intense production to China and 3rd world countries is also helping reducing your carbon footprint...
NUCLEAR POWER IS SAFE AND CHEAP FULL STOP.
The decrease in CO2 per capita emissions up to the plateau in the 1980s is attributable to nuclear power in France. The second more recent decline over the past 20 or 30 years is attributable to industrial activity moving to other countries, efficiency standards more recently, growing renewable energy production.
Get ready for the incoming anti-nuclear lobbyists that reddit has for some reason. Remember that no one answer is the correct answer to reducing carbon emissions.
That's cool but please look into how they get their god damn uranium...
Countries that have the money and infrastructure can choose nuclear.
Lol, and putting factories in shit countries as china.
One thing I've heard is that the extraction / creation of the fuel is extremely bad for the environment. Can someone enlighten me here? I assume that's taken into account for this graph but I'd love to learn more about it.
Common German L
Good.
Yeah also on the expense of the sub-saharan people where the uranium is coming from, you don't hear about the ongoing (not for long though) french neo-colonialism in Africa. For people that don't know, I have one word for you to search for, that is if you are honestly looking for the truth and have enough critical thinking: FCFA.
Then why did they hide it from the rest of the world?
This is why Greenpeace is probably more environmentally damaging than all the oil companies combined.
I am afraid that nuclear power will have a place if AI becomes popular and it's used a lot, as it requires a much higher amount of power to work.
Well on nuclear power is the best but the people on the top rather waist time and make more money with burning fossil fuel because they make more money in that business. While with nuclear it be one and done the only problem be maintenance of the plants. The fear of leaks and the irresponsible of the nuclear waist that will be inevitably be made.
France was also getting a huge percentage of their uranium from Niger, and look how that ended up
France went to nuclear in 64 and Chernobyl was 86 since then quite reasonably people were worried about nuclear. Now solar and wind are so much cheaper it's not economical to build nuclear power reactors when batteries and solar can be up so quickly.
Up 150% carbon emissions per capita from 1880 isn’t going to stop climate change i’m afraid
Nuclear power is amazing until something goes wrong & everyone is searching for iodine pills.
Till it’s not.  One day when Russia bombs the shit out of one of those plants and Paris can’t be seen by a human for 6,000 years, let’s come back to this chart.
[deleted]
Wind and solar weren’t as efficient back then. Also starting with nuclear now is the most expensive way to go about this. [CSIRO report.](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-05-22/nuclear-power-double-the-cost-of-renewables/103868728?utm_source=abc_news_app&utm_medium=content_shared&utm_campaign=abc_news_app&utm_content=link)
So, somehow their use of nuclear for energy, the corporation which runs it is currently heading to bankruptcy btw due to costs, somehow equates to 100% of their gdp somehow?
Yep, sad how the rest of world has not adopted it. It's not like every stem person I know is constantly saying this. What's really tragic is Germany, shuting off all nuclear for coal/natural gas
This chart is giving me brain damage. Go fuck yourself.
With nuclear they still need to deal with the spent nuclear waste. It will be radioactive for millions of years. Think about that Millions.
Why CO2 per capita dropped to nearly zero in 1940s? Which ecologist made such a great achievement for the environment?
Especially when you can buy electricity on the European market when your reactors crap out
Share this over on r/energy and you'll get promptly banned. People are so incredibly terrified of nuclear energy they'd rather let the planet burn.
Wow! And I’m living right next to it… in Germany.
The amount of people in this thread trying to make ignorant claims as to why nuclear is so 'bad' is the reason we aren't using nuclear energy around the world. You all need to do some research guys. It's been studied for decades at this point. Should be a damn class about this kind of stuff. Energy is a pretty important part of our lives and there's quite an interesting history and an even more interesting future ahead.
Plot twist: The entire population of France in 2022 were 2 trillionaires.
The best way is to shut down the factories and relocate them to save 0.1 dollars and import in mass. That's what France did.
it's not even 2 years after russia attacked ukraine and we had a major nuclear scare from the power plant there. it's 13 years after fukushima and almost 40 years after chernobyl.

why isn't anyone talking about the risk of accidents or war? a nuclear disaster could make wide parts of europe uninhabitable or at least poison the literal soil we grow our food on for decades. it's short sighted to think there won't be another war or just a series of unfortunate events and were fucked. 

in germany the renewable sector was almost destroyed by political forces, not because of real issues with the technology. 

as a society we've lost track of the big picture.

The future is bright
Choo choo all aboard the nuclear circle jerk train
I find it funny, that every pro-renewables argument gets questioned. While they themself don't realize that nuclear has a bunch of problems themself.

Like what hypocrisy is this? Do they not know that nuclear still requires fuel?
A rise in price on the market affect nuclear much more than it affects renewables. Because the latter only has to be built once, and they will continue working. Nuclear on the other hands makes you dependant on states outside of Europe.

For me, the pro-nuclear people are very strange. I really don't understand why they fight so hard for a technology that isn't even that good. Do they just like sci-fi things, and nuclear sounds cooler?
Its more expensive, it's not renewable, it makes us dependent, it requires excavation, it produces waste...

Renewables seem like a much better long term investment, until fusion is a thing. Which will probably take decades if not a century.
That's wrong. The statistics clear shows that war with Germany is the fastest and most efficient way.
That statistic doesn't take into account the problems and CO2 beeing produced in Mali while mining the uranium. And if we subtract the amount of wealth caused by Frances neocolonialism in Africa, than it suddenly don't look so good
Isn’t there an island we can build a nuclear power plant on and run wires to the nearest costliest? And that way it is surrounded by water in case of a meltdown?
Building Nuclear Powerplants has immense emissions for minimal energy gain
No, but outsorcing manufacturing to China was... At least for a nice chart that you can misrepresent here on reddit :)

(I'm pro nuclear though)
France praying for technology to shoot the waste into space or make it edible
That and outsourcing emissions to countries like China with globalization, which is less sustainable. 

To be fair, even if you account for outsourced emissions, the graph looks good, and we still see a decoupling, but it's less impressive
Does France have some kind of solution where to put the radioactive garbage? In Germany we have the same discussion, and I do get the argument, that nuclear power is clean as it emits very little CO2. But to me, this is simply ignoring the fact that it produces a kind of waste that is the exact opposite of clean and poses a huge problem on at least tens of generations after us. So e.g. Bavarian politicians claim that exiting nuclear power in Germany was super dumb, but they aggressively refuse to even consider dumps for nuclear waste in their territory. I find this very naive. How does France deal with that waste?
What are the Costs of maintaining them? As far as i know those plants are old af.
There are cheaper, safer, and more accessible energy options out there that we should be investing in instead.

Constructing nuclear infrastructure is incredibly time-consuming and expensive, leading to an anti-competitive market prone to monopolisation.

This puts significant control in the hands of a few, and given current affairs and the state of the world we live in, these profit-driven entities are unlikely to actually prioritise public safety

Can we really trust that those in control will adequately manage nuclear waste and maintain high safety standard for those working in this industry?

germany closed most of its nuclear power in 2012, the last ones april 2023

Except when you look at that graph and out Germany's graph right beside it, the CO2/capita curves look almost identical. 

https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co2-emissions-and-gdp-per-capita?time=earliest..latest&country=FRA\~DEU
We need both nuclear and renewables. Renewables are cheaper and faster to build, but aren't efficient enough on their own. Nuclear is great as a baseline power source but expensive and slow to build.
It's funny to see how the people behind this nuclear campaign seem to be quaking in their boots because solar and wind made the entire industry obsolete. So long nukies
Now do it for denmark, also denmark won´t have to fight the long term issue of storing the waste
Idk about you, but I enjoy safe drinking water
nuclear power has never been an issue, but chernobyl really scared people. nuclear waste also isn't as big an issue as people make it out to be.
Germany has the better development
