The world has probably passed ‘peak air pollution’. “Global air pollution is now falling, and we can save many lives by accelerating this decline.”

Yeah, but now StarLink satellites are burning holes in the ozone layer again.
What we're observing is a giant uncontrolled experiment in atmospheric chemistry. The demise of just one Gen1 Starlink satellite produces about 30 kilograms (66 pounds) of aluminum oxide, a compound that eats away at the ozone layer. A new study finds these oxides have increased 8-fold between 2016 and 2022, and the recent surge is increasing the pollution even more.

This is the name that'll be displayed next to comments you make on kottke.org; your email will not be displayed
    publicly. I'd encourage you to use your real name (or at least your first name and last initial) but you can
    also pick something that you go by when you participate in communities online. Choose something durable and
    reasonably unique (not "Me" or "anon"). Please don't change this often. No impersonation.
Note: I'm letting folks change their display names because the membership service that
    kottke.org uses collects full names and I thought some people might not want their names displayed publicly
    here. If it gets abused, I might disable this feature.
If you feel like this comment goes against the grain of the community
        guidelines or is otherwise inappropriate, please let me know and I will take a
    look at it.
