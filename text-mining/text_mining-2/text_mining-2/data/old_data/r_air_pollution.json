Winter is arriving which causes cold air from the Himalayas to enter the Indus-Ganga plains. The warm low land air of the plains traps this cold air from the mountains under itself. Then the cold air from the mountains lays low and traps the pollution under it which worsens the situation. \n\nAs winter arrives and it gets colder people will start burning wood to keep warm. In cities you don't have enough wood so people will start burning anything that burns well. Plastic, tyres etc are in abundance. This further worsens the situation cuz the pollution just doesn't let the heat from the sun reach the surface. Which makes people burn more things to stay warm. \n\nWhy would people burn these things instead of using heaters? Cuz they're poor. And old plastic and tyres are available for free.",

Currently I'm in Busan, and the AQI is above 200. The little cartoon man on the index is *purple*, and very unhappy. I hoped that leaving Seoul would alleviate the problem, but it has not.\n\nBesides the pollution, my stay has been very nice. But the air pollution problem is the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth thing you need to know before visiting Korea, and everyone seems to sidestep mentioning the issue. If you're a travel vlogger, or an expat living in Korea, you're not doing anyone any favors by not making the pollution problem exceedingly clear.

I was a little surprised. \n\nAlso, a lot of people also don\u2019t care.

The peak pollen season is April and May.\n\nWhile it can\u2019t be said that Korea has clean air all year round, an AQI above 200 is not a typical situation.\n\nWhen I experienced this in Busan, I didn\u2019t notice any burning smell or irritation in my eyes or throat, so I thought it was different from typical air pollution. Pine pollen leaves yellow traces on car surfaces and puddles of rainwater, making it easy to identify.\n\n[This is a news article about this. Sorry it's in Korean.](https://news.sbs.co.kr/news/endPage.do?news_id=N1004743086)\n\nUsing Copilot, here\u2019s a summary:\n\nOn May 3rd, South Korea experienced an unexpected surge in particulate matter (PM10) levels, despite recent rain and wind. The PM10 levels in some regions soared to between 200 and 300\u338d/\u33a5. However, the concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), which has smaller particles, remained low throughout the day. This is usually seen during strong yellow dust storms, but there was no such storm on this day.\n\nInterestingly, the sudden increase in PM10 levels during the day is believed to be due to pollen, such as pine pollen. The Korea Environment Institute observed a sharp rise in total dust (TSP) concentration data during the day on May 2nd and 3rd, while the PM2.5 concentration remained very low.\n\nThe institute analyzed that considering the change in dust concentration in the air and the absence of dust coming in from overseas, the concentration of particulate matter rose sharply as pollen such as pine pollen spread widely in the strong wind. The Ministry of Environment and the Meteorological Administration also announced that the high concentration of particulate matter today was largely influenced by pollen.\n\nThe Meteorological Administration predicts that the pine pollen concentration risk index in most parts of the country will rise to high tomorrow (4th) and the day after tomorrow (5th), and some areas will rise to very high. It is recommended that people with pollen allergies wear sunglasses or masks when going out, wash their hands and faces after going out, and take a shower before going to bed to prevent pollen from sticking to bedding. Pollen is now considered the fourth major atmospheric pollutant, following particulate matter, yellow dust, and ozone.",
            "A problem is Koreans have traditionally built cities in flat lands surrounded by mountains. Seoul is built like this, for example. This was because these areas tended to be warmer than surrounding areas because it blocks the wind, especially when winters were very cold. With industrialization, however, this means pollution gets trapped inside the mountain walls at the source of where the pollution is generated.",

I found Mexico City to be worse than Seoul for every day pollution. My clothing changed colors after walking around Mexico City all day and that still hasn't happened to me in Seoul. But I'm sure it would in April.\n\nVery surprising that you didn't come across this in your research. Air pollution is my number one concern about possibly living in Korea; it's a well known and well documented problem.",

It's called Hwangsa (Yellow Dust) and brings in Chinese toxic pollutants from the Mongolian winds. It doesn't help that locally, both North and South Korea still burns coal in the rural regions adding to the pollution. In Indonesia and Malaysia (and Thailand) it gets pretty bad too given they do slash and burn agriculture and burn palm oil, paired with southern winds from China, I think its often worse off there.

They have a $50USD air purifier that can also house a carbon \"gas filter\" which is an extra purchase. It's called a Fornuftig air purifier and the extra gas filter is called a Fornuftig gas filter. The gas filter costs an extra $10 and lasts about six months. This little beauty of a machine won't clean the air in a large room but for the price and considering the problem you could buy a few of them. I bought one for a very tiny room rental and it helps a lot. But I eventually nailed the best solution: tilt it and point that sucker's fresh and clean air right towards your face when you're sleeping and when you're sitting in place during the day time. Because wearing those covid KF94 or N95 masks when you're outside helps a bit but it's the indoor pollution that's the worst, the masks fall off when you sleep, you just can't wear one all day, and even though they say these masks are effective against pollution it's not like blocking covid. Covid was basically a liquid problem because of saliva particles but pollution is mostly a gas that will always slip through the cracks around the always imperfect mask seal around your face. Hope I helped somebody. And thank you Sweden for making this cheap and excellent thing especially as I even had to search around looking at all the ultra expensive air purifiers that didn't even work for air pollution because there was no gas filter option. I mean seriously, apparently it takes Sweden to make an air purifier that actually considers air pollution.",

        "text": "Every week we see plenty of posts about how bad Bangkoks air quality is. The air quality is certainly not good. Consensus seems to be that this is devastating to your health and if you live in Bangkok for decades you'll reduce your life span by 5-10 years. Comments in these posts offering a different viewpoint always gets downvoted so there's never any constructive discussion about this topic. I wanted to look into this some more and get some other perspectives on this. \n\nAs a starting point, the average lifespan for Bangkok residents is 78.97 years. Very close to top modern countries with very little air pollution. Why do they live so long if air pollution significantly reduced their life span? \n\nI also ran this query on ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini: \n\"If I live in Bangkok for 50 years. By how much am I reducing my life expectancy due to air pollution? \"\nThey all gave answers between 1-4 years based on various studies and research. Please run the query by yourself for details. Their answers seemed very credible with good sources. 1-4 years shorter life span is probably a lot less than most people would have thought. \n\nThen we also need to consider that most expats won't spend more than perhaps 2-3 hours a day breathing in the polluted air. You can also have air purifiers at home and at your office so that you breathe in close to perfect air most of the day. You can also mitigate much damage by maintaining strong health in general and you can wear a PM2.5 face mask while riding your motorbike in heavy traffic. \n\nIf you use the AI models to run a query with these factors as well, their response is that you'll reduce your lifespan by 6-12 months. But we could make a long list of things that most people do or don\u2019t do that reduces your lifespan by an equal amount or more due to non optimal, sleep, exercise and diet. But people prefer to complain about air pollution while their poor general health is what\u2019s going to take many more years of their life than what air pollution in Bangkok ever will. \n\nThe other part of this topic would be the immediate health concerns which is more subjective and personal. What I can say is that myself and the vast majority of people I speak to do not have immediate symptoms besides days where AQI goes above  150+, which is a small minority of all days of the year. Keep in mind that the average PM 2.5 in Bangkok is 25-30 which is categorized as \u201cmoderate\u201d and not \u201cunhealthy\u201d according to the AQI index. People seem to believe that Bangkok has the worst air quality in the world on par with New Delhi etc. Which is simply not true. Again, Bangkoks air quality is labeled as \u201cmoderate\u201d based on the AQI index. \n\nI'm not saying Bangkoks air quality is good and I'm not saying that there's no health implications. And of course it should be a top priority for the city to greatly reduce air pollution. What I am saying is that the health implications are a lot less severe than people think and that most people (not all) can do things to mitigate them to such a large extent that the impact on your immediate health is not noticeable and that your lifespan will most likely not be significantly reduced. \n\nEdit 1\nPlease understand that this post looks at air pollution from the perspective of the average expat here in Bangkok. Which is what this subreddit mostly consist of. Of course the situation is different for other groups of people such as local delivery drivers. \n\nEdit 2\nThere\u2019s several top comments here being upvoted saying that the AI models can\u2019t be trusted. The AI models did not come up with the life expectancy being reduced by 1-4 years. They merely quote studies and use tools developed for this purpose. For example, ChatGPT used \u201cThe Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) which is \u201ca tool that measures the impact of air pollution on life expectancy\u201d. It was created exactly for this purpose and it\u2019s used by the WHO, UN and many governments like the UK. Its conclusion based on Bangkoks pm2.5 levels was a reduced life expectancy of 1.75 years. All in line with other studies that the AI models quoted. Also in line with Bangkoks life expectancy already being high at 79 and clearly not significantly lower than other countries. \n\nSo no, the AI models didn\u2019t make up this data. Run the query yourself and you\u2019ll see the exact sources and models they used to conclude the 1-4 years of reduced life expectancy (without the mitigations of reduced exposure to outside air, air purifiers etc).

Either Thailand under reports their cases, or humans actually adapt to polluted air. I couldn't find compelling evidence on pubmed either. There are some studies that show theoretical damage caused by high pm2.5 levels, but not much when it comes to overall quality of life and lifespan. Thai people seem to be doing well in sports, and daily activities despite the high levels of air pollution.\n\nTo conclude, yes there's air pollution, but how it's affecting us is unclear.",

            "I wouldn't necessarily trust AI input, but the general conclusions seem to work.  It would be possible for people to limit their pollution exposure in the few months a year when it's more severe in Bangkok, and most of the time pollution levels are moderate.  Not for motorcycle delivery drivers, as commented here.\n\nI've seen studies and research into impact of health on running in moderate or high pollution levels, and it's also not what one would expect.  Benefits still outweigh risks, up to a pretty high level, somewhere in that 120 to 150 index range (based on my memory of vague conclusions I read a couple of years ago, so only offered as a general indicator).  I don't completely trust speculative and limited study results either, but again I think there's something there.\n\nA family cousin just died of cancer, and when that comes up you re-think how low level risks map out.  He smoked, ate a bad diet, consumed lots of nutrient-empty, high-sugar foods, didn't exercise, lived under stress related to unemployment, and had unfavorable genetics, so to some extent he almost had it coming.

Based on global and regional studies:\n\nEstimating the Impact:\n\t1.\tGlobal Data on PM2.5 Impact:\n\t\u2022\tResearch by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) suggests that each 10 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 increase in PM2.5 exposure can reduce life expectancy by approximately 0.98 years.\n\t\u2022\tBangkok\u2019s annual PM2.5 levels average around 22.8 \u00b5g/m\u00b3, exceeding the WHO guideline of 5 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 by approximately 17.8 \u00b5g/m\u00b3.\n\t2.\tLife Expectancy Reduction in Bangkok:\n\t\u2022\tUsing the AQLI formula:\n\ufffc\nFor Bangkok\u2019s excess PM2.5 of 17.8 \u00b5g/m\u00b3:\n\ufffc\n\t3.\tCumulative Exposure Over 50 Years:\n\t\u2022\tLong-term exposure amplifies health risks such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.

The sources and reasoning is not the AI models themselves but actual studies on this exact topic which they cite and link in their response. \n\nLifespan is one of the key data points to look at. If the life expectancy in Bangkok was 70 and they couldn\u2019t explain why then I\u2019d be worried it could be air pollution.

            "from a research perspective, it would be very difficult to study the ACTUAL effects of air pollution on life expectancy for a particular city. Right now all the data and tools we have are based on averages. The truth is that air pollution not only fluctuates in severity everyday but also in composition depending on the largest contributing factor to the air pollution on that day, at that time. The composition of the air pollution in conjunction with exposure to air pollution is what\u2019s most likely to cause pulmonary conditions which may decrease life expectancy. In order to study that to find the absolute truth we\u2019d have to do a long term controlled study and expose a group of people to the cities air for the same amount of time each day, and a control group that is exposed to only clean air. And we\u2019d then have to monitor them until death. \n\nThere are many problems with this that makes this study impossible. one is that we know air pollution is detrimental to health in one way or another so we cannot ethically expose people to polluted air to test this. Two is that it\u2019s almost impossible to find a sample of people for a long term study who are all so similar. Three is that we cannot truly control other variables over the samples life span, diet, mental health etc. Four is that immediately after the study the air pollution would be a completely different concentration than it was during the study because it was a lifespan study, making the entire thing basically pointless because we cannot \u201ctruly\u201d make \u201caccurate\u201d predictions based on data that is now different. \n\nSoo with all of this in mind, we will likely never know the absolute truth, and we have to rely on tools that use averages and models that make statistical predictions. What we do know is that air pollution is generally bad for health, and long term exposure to anything bad is definitely detrimental. We also know that things like population density, construction, fires, explosions, decline in waste management etc, can lead to sudden changes in air quality which will affect averages which is probably why there is contradictory information out there.",

If you could choose between Bangkok being pollution free or not what would you choose? \n\nYes, of course limiting exposure is healthier than sitting in it, well done, great conclusion.\n\nFirst of all you don\u2019t know how effective the air purifiers/A/C truly are.\n\nSecond of all not everyone can just limit their outside activity to 2-3 hours a day. What about the people that need to commute on a motorcycle 1-2 hours a day? Or the poor food vendors just staying outside in it all day for example?\n\nHaving to limit your outside time because of pollution again is another negative side effect of\u2026 POLLUTION. \n\nYou are just making an argument for arguments sake and showing your naivety to data in general.\n\nNot everything can be measured in data. This is by its nature a very emotional subject as some people are more at risk to pm2.5 than others. Emotionally people might hate to see their kids having to breathe this shit in.",

There's got to be a more cost effective way than that to do this?\nOr just for fun, let's try this: \nIt looks like China will actually decrease their CO2 emissions this year, that's great. But if we just take their average CO2 change, year over year, it's very roughly 2M tons increase per year (within the last decade or so). So if we just want to pause the average difference in CO2 over last year from China, so that they only release the same they did the year before, it would cost the Swiss this many: $1600000000\nOr 1.6 billion dollars (which would need to double every year to keep output stable). That's not decreasing CO2 in any way, that's just halting the acceleration of the release of CO2, from just China.\nJust for fun again, what if we wanted to mitigate last year's output from China entirely? Let's say 11.5 billion tons.\nIt would cost 9.2 trillion dollars, or 11.5 times the GDP of Switzerland to mitigate 1 year worth of China's output of CO2. That's a lotta CO2. \n...

You make a very important point that carbon dioxide removal (CDR) can easily be used to prop up carbon creating industry. In fact, Exxon Mobile has spent hundreds of millions building their own direct air capture (DAC) facility and has been promoting it with the tag line \"heavy industry with low emissions\". This is greenwashing plain and simple. While DAC will likely be viable in the future when it can be powered by electricity from renewable energy, right now it is not carbon negative on balance. Additionally, Exxon's DAC stunt facility will only bring down 4,000 tons of CO2 equivalent per year. To put that in perspective, that is roughly 0.00001% of the United States emissions this year. It's a farce.\n\nBut! The reality is that we will need to remove CO2 from the atmosphere at scale in order to keep warming in check. The IPCC estimates that we will need to remove roughy 380 gigatons of CO2 between 2050 and 2100 to keep warming to +1.5C. Graphyte's approach is something we can start doing right now because it doesn't rely on lengthy, expensive R&D. The carbon removal is high quality in that it's very \"real\" in the sense that it can be measured accurately and it's very permanent - there is a high degree of confidence that the carbon bricks will stay inert underground for long periods of time (\\~1000 years).",

It's still a little too high to be practical on a wide scale today, but a 6 fold decrease from the previous price is a really encouraging development.\n\n(Of course, the majority of the world's emissions aren't from gasoline.

            "Despite global efforts to transition from fossil fuels to clean energy, oil and gas (O&G) production is nearing record levels in the United States, posing concern among health experts about what this O&G growth means for air quality and human health. While there is extensive research on the climate effects of O&G-produced methane\u2014a key contributor to air pollution\u2014few studies have measured the health effects of the air pollution that O&G activity generates. \n\nA new study led by the School of Public Health, the University of North Carolina Institute for the Environment (UNC-IE), PSE Healthy Energy, and Environmental Defense Fund fills this gap.\n\nPublished in the journal Environmental Research: Health, the study found that air pollution from the oil and gas sector in the United States has substantial adverse impacts on air quality, human health, and health costs. \n\nThe findings show that the pollutants nitrogen oxide , fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) from U.S. oil and gas production contributed to 7,500 excess deaths, 410,000 asthma attacks, and 2,200 new cases of childhood asthma across the U.S. in 2016. Factoring in related respiratory and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and other health challenges, oil and gas production was responsible for $77 billion in annual health costs. Comparatively, this total is three times the estimated climate impact costs of methane emissions from oil and gas operations.\n\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2752-5309/acc886",

Providing that Putin's high officials were well-educated guys and knew how to persuade Putin's madness to stop invading Ukraine, Russia might've experienced the way of another richer nation and Ukrainians might not have experienced the painful moment to become refugees. \n\nUnfortunately, still, lots of uneducated people who don't have smart macro visions have been living as leaders of many nations regardless of totalitarian countries or democratic nations. That's the problem. Those knuckleheads used to commit the saddest moment based on their subjective stupid thoughts historically.",

It is a major component of particulate matter (PM), which is an air pollutant. The mechanisms by which these very small particles (nanoparticles) cause well-known health problems are poorly understood, although in part due to the chemicals they are coated with during combustion.\n\nhttps://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(22)00200-5/fulltext",

            "Oh god the nuclear fanboys have hit this sub as well, here's a bunch of source and data I wanna pull up from last time [My previous post last ime this happened.](https://www.reddit.com/r/solarpunk/comments/12ez6jq/-/jff8ysc)\n\nOr read it here:\n\n>According to the IPCC report found here https://report.ipcc.ch/ar6syr/pdf/IPCC\\_AR6\\_SYR\\_SPM.pdf, on page[https://report.ipcc.ch/ar6syr/pdf/IPCC\\_AR6\\_SYR\\_SPM.pdf](https://report.ipcc.ch/ar6syr/pdf/IPCC_AR6_SYR_SPM.pdf) 28 nuclear (fission and fusion) is the second worse tool to combat climate change, could it be used in conjunction sure but here are some main points:\n\n>1. Cost of implementation, [per gigawatt solar and wind](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/levelized-cost-of-energy) are [both already near the same price per kWh as nuclear](https://www.iea.org/reports/projected-costs-of-generating-electricity-2020) and are still going down in cost.\n>2. Land consumption, the sum of land available to generate the power is lower especially for solar then nuclear due to being able to be built near residences, on top of buildings, and in unstable regions, nuclear facilities however need to be built in the right conditions otherwise costs go up to account for factors such as earthquakes and water runoffs. Your point about powerplant sized is [correct](https://ourworldindata.org/land-use-per-energy-source) but it fails to consider the variability of places the different plants can be located, and according to the same source on shore wind uses about the same land per MW accounting for each individual turbine instead of the farm, as wind farms are typically made on agricultural sites.\n>3. Time cost, it is frankly too late to consider nuclear with an average [build time of 5 to 10](https://www.statista.com/statistics/712841/median-construction-time-for-reactors-since-1981/) years at best it gives us 3 years before the point of no return, at worst 2 years too late, [solar](https://solarsena.com/how-long-does-it-take-to-install-a-solar-farm/) and [wind](https://www.renewablesfirst.co.uk/windpower/windpower-learning-centre/how-long-will-the-whole-project-take/) on the other hand have variable limit with a MAX of 5 years with some projects taking only 1 month to get online.\n>4. Safety, in your own source the difference between nuclear, wind, and solar is 0.01 in a graph with a maximum of 32.72, yes this indicates nuclear is safe but it also indicates the difference is in margin of error territory and is not safer than wind or solar.\n>5. Your second source is a prototype, which will be nice in the future BUT it isn't commercially available now, solar and wind are. A lot of the talk around SMR (also known as MSR) and advanced reactors would be cool, but again are still in very early stages that aren't in use yet.\n>6. For your 3rd source with the LFTR (first off please find a better source than namebunchofnumbers), showcases a technology that has [it's own problems](https://energycentral.com/c/ec/what-are-problems-lftr-technology) and are also included in the IPCCs report showcasing it to not be cost effective.\n>7. One concern not mentioned here is land exploitation, unfortunately solar does use conflict minerals, but nuclear waste has been known to be dumped in [first nations sites](https://www.foe.org.au/radioactive-waste-and-nuclear-war-australias-aboriginal-people), which personally IS NOT SOLAR PUNK AT ALL, exploitation of land should be avoided and yet it isn't within the nuclear sector.\n>8. Nuclear power can be made in coal power plants with a [15% to 35%](https://fuelcycleoptions.inl.gov/SiteAssets/SitePages/Home/C2N2022Report.pdf), which is actually pretty solar punk, thinking \"hey instead of recycling lets reuse and reduce first\" unfortunately the cost decrease is still not enough to make nuclear financially viable compared to solar.\n>9. The plants to create radioactive gold and other medical needs are not the same plants that produce power, we can still have medical plants without the power plants.\n>10. Batteries are getting exponentially better but we should still consider the lithium and water usage as you said, just as we should consider the uranium and water usage of nuclear. Another consideration is that baseload power fundamentally is a myth, solar panels and wind do benefit from storage but also generate mainly during peak times.\n\n>TLDR; the benefits you have for nuclear either aren't proven are on the same level as solar and wind, and the cons are massive. Should we consider nuclear, yes but not for a current solution, it is not the holy grail you've deemed it to be in this post.\n\nAll in all, is nuclear better than coal, yes, but it isn't the solution or even something that should be considered: base load power is a myth, renewables are cheaper per giga watt in both financial and time terms, and every single technology that makes nuclear better than renewables doesn't have a working power plant out yet and based on the time power plants take to get up won't for another 10 years (we have 8 years till the final no turning back point for climate change, nuclear might have been good 10 years ago, but we're too late *for that*, we still have a chance but if we're going to use that chance we need to have something that's operational before the no turning back point).",

Coal-burning plants don't have to be located in the city and can be in more rural areas, where there are fewer people. That said, the US has been transitioning away from coal for a number of years.",
            "Some other considerations about forced commuting for non-hands on jobs :\n\nStress and anxiety, \"RUSH hour\" traffic immediacy making people drive with unsafe behavior, speeds, maneuvers, tired, and in some cases also causes road rage. Congestion slowing and limiting rescue personnel's ability to get to a scene.\n\nRisk from essentially being forced to drive in bad weather conditions (heavy rain, black ice mornings, snow and iced winter roads, very poor visibility - and that forced commuting among other drivers who don't adjust their driving behavior adequately in order to drive safer in those conditions). Also, in some areas when leaving work near dusk or in dark - risk of running into deer on roads (or them running into you).\n\nForced to drive more often including among people who have been drinking, on prescription or illicit drugs, over-tired, emotional, psych/depression issues.\n\nRelated to the previous few points - risk of accidents potentially with lifelong fallout from injury, or in some cases death. That and how those affect a greater number of people in your family potentially.\n\n. . . . .\n\nRisk from potentially attack/robbery, being accosted. Especially lone women and other often targeted demographics. Combined with the fact that many have to commute from nicer burbs to more crime ridden and homeless/psych populations in downtown/inner city areas for work. People with jobs that require them to dress professionally may outline them as someone with money to target as well.\n\nUnnecessary Fuel Costs to the commuter and an enormous waste of fuel supply by forcing non-hands-on jobs to commute back and forth every workday. The unnecessary devaluation/wear&tear on vehicles, wear&tear on roads and infrastructure, massive amount of added pollution from exhaust (and brake dust) which has detrimental health effects to life directly, plus adversely affecting the global climate health/life wise and financially.\n\nOil made more scarce from daily commutes, and thus more expensive (though oil production itself is something of an artificial scarcity controlled by OPEC production, # of refineries built and their output, how much USA chooses to tap reserves, etc.) This affects your personal wealth in regard to being forced to fill up your tank, but importantly, the fuel costs cascade into affecting the price of everything.\n\nEnergy and money wasted running a remote location and keeping home running. Heat/AirConditioning, lighting, water, Broadband/networking, commuting to work requiring parking areas and at home driveway maintenance (e.g. snow and ice removal, landscaping/weeds etc., also snow and ice removal from your vehicle and driveway before each time you drive it in certain climates at times), remote parking costs, upkeep costs of multiple locations.\n\nLost time/life, lost sleep, can result in operating on a sleep deficit (and as outlined before, driving on a sleep deficit).\n\nWasting current perishable food at home more often because you have to eat at establishments outside of home while at work.\n\nHarder to eat healthy in many cases due to availability and time constraints. Also more likely to suffer issues with bad food/food prep health wise.\n\nHygiene of others in shared spaces/bathrooms.\n\nillness, infection, disease, (even bedbugs in some cases). Less communication of illness so less downtime.\n\nExposure to chemicals and agents, poor air quality, poor water quality, mold etc. in some cases.\n\nNoise pollution at the workplace in some cases.\n\nIssues with other people at work, being pinned in that space.\n\nSome other considerations are:\n\nEasier to maintain a regular schedule taking meds if necessary.\n\nWhen forced to commute, having to manage someone being home for getting children onto and/or off of school bus (which doesn't necessarily align with when you leave/arrive back)\n\nHaving someone home to let dog(s) out to \"go to the bathroom\", feed animals, get deliveries, be home while hired strangers do work on your house.\n\nYou are also home if any leaks were to happen, smoke/fire/electronics issues were to start, and you will be less likely to have your home and belongings (and even packages) robbed since you are there more often during work hours.",

People with an unnatural low level of intelligence are more easily influenced, manipulated. Lead poisoning might end up destroying the world, though an eventual all out nuclear world war. Trump for example, tried to appeal to his base by touting how effective the anti missile systems in Israel works. He coins the idea that if America has a strong anti missile system, that we would not have to be afraid of the Russians.  It is, of course, completely false, but his audience fails to apply any critical thought.  \nIt might sound that I sound unhinged, crazy, etc, but I'm actually being quite serious!  \nSee, if people did not have lead poisoning, then they would be more open to intelligent thought. Instead, they just side with what \"feels\" right, without applying any thought, and automatically approving what their hero claims.  \nLook at some of the street interviews, where they ask people why they feel that Trump is so good. I'm using Trump here as an example, and it's not really meant to be specifically about him, but it's just as a strong example what the results are from mass lead poisoning, I believe.  \nWhat are the numbers of lead poisoning again. It's quite high in the US. In fact, might the US have the highest level on average of mass population lead poisoning? It's not just Flint Michigan. It looks like Chicago has city wide water lead pipes. It's far more out of control that what is talked about, and the consequences are incredible. One might think \"meh, so what if a few people aren't as smart as me\", but never underestimate the power of stupid people in great numbers. Many of them vote. And they're used and manipulated.

Out of these 95k, the vast majority are in China, so adjust your rhetoric accordingly. From the paper itself:\n\nhttps://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/21/eabe1178\n\n> **Change in air pollution\u2013related premature mortality**\n>\n> Aggregating across pollutants based on monitor data, we find that changes in pollutant concentrations associated with COVID lockdowns up to 6 July 2020 resulted in \u221295,000 (95% CI, \u2212160,000 to \u221229,000) premature mortalities from NO2, PM2.5, and ozone exposure during the lockdown period. Statistically significant changes in air pollution at the 5% level contribute to \u221267,000 (95% CI, \u2212115,000 to +19,000) of the total premature mortalities. For comparison, the global death toll of COVID-19 as of 6 July 2020 was 544,000. Changes in NO2 exposure account for \u221231,000 (95% CI, 65,000 to \u22122300) premature mortalities, while changes in PM2.5 exposure account for \u221264,000 premature mortalities (95% CI, \u221295,000 to \u221232,000) and changes in ozone exposure for 300 additional premature mortalities globally (95% CI, \u2212190 to 800).\n>\n> **China accounts for 79% of the estimated decrease in total premature mortalities, including 65% of the reductions in NO2 mortalities, and 85% of the reductions in PM2.5 mortalities. For Europe, we estimate a total change of \u22126600 premature mortalities (95% CI, \u221213,000 to +380) from reduced exposure to NO2 and \u22126100 premature mortalities (95% CI, \u22129100 to +3100) from changes in PM2.5**. If different CRFs are used (see Materials and Methods), we find average mortality estimates of \u221243,000 (95% CI, \u221262,000 to \u221225,000) for PM2.5 and \u221251,000 (95% CI, \u221262,000 to \u221240,000) for NO2 (see Materials and Methods). When using cause-specific CRFs, we find that changes in ambient levels of NO2 resulted in \u22122800 (95% CI, \u221211,000 to +6000) premature mortalities from respiratory diseases and \u221210,000 (95% CI, \u221241,000 to +21,000) from cardiovascular diseases. Ambient changes in PM2.5 are found to result in \u221210,000 (95% CI, \u221214,000 to \u22127000) premature mortalities from respiratory diseases and \u221238,000 (95% CI, \u221250,000 to \u221225,000) from cardiovascular diseases. Overall, using cause-specific CRFs results in a total of \u221260,000 (95% CI, \u2212116,000 to \u22124200) premature mortalities, compared to \u221295,000 with the all-cause CRFs, with 75% of avoided premature mortalities being from cardiovascular diseases and 25% from respiratory diseases.\n>\n> **Reductions in air pollution\u2013related premature mortalities per capita represent less than 2.8% (95% CI, 0.56 to 5.1%) of the deaths per capita from COVID-19 in the United States (51) and 6.4% (95% CI, 1.0 to 12%) in Europe, but are between 2.3 and 16 times greater than the reported number of COVID-19 deaths per capita in Asia.** (Up to last July that is, so resist the urge to comment about India or the like.)\n\nIn fact, the article also says the same thing later on, but of course, even the people who should know science cannot be condensed to headlines still do not read even the articles linked.\n\n> The United States saw a more than 4% drop in airborne nitrogen oxide levels, but a less than 1% decline in ozone, the data showed. Airborne particulate matter levels remained relatively stable nationally as well.\n>\n> As a result, the United States accounted for a fraction of the reduction in \"premature deaths\" -- or deaths occurring earlier than life expectancy -- caused by respiratory illnesses linked with air pollution exposure.\n>\n> Conversely, China, which, along with the United States, is among the world's biggest polluters, likely made up nearly 80% of the global reduction in premature deaths attributed to air pollution, according to the researchers.\n>\n> The findings suggest COVID-19 lockdowns \"exerted a limited effect\" on global air quality, although some parts of East Asia experienced \"pronounced improvements,\" they said.\n>\n> \"Although the COVID-19 related lockdowns brought significant reductions in economic activities, air pollution levels did not decrease as much as had been speculated at first,\" Chossiere said.\n>\n> \"Primary pollution [from] nitrogen dioxide had the largest decreases and associated health benefits, but, with the notable exception of China, secondary air pollution [from] fine particulates and ozone did not bring significant health benefits,\" he said.\n\nIn the study, they say that long-term air pollution policies would have more impact than the short-term lockdowns.",

This is about larger air particulate from roadways like rubber and metal dust that are also quite bad for children to breath in. \nThe trees act as physical filter that trap the particulates until they can be washed away by rain.  \n\n>The scientists believe that western red cedar performed best at preventing the particulate air pollution from reaching the playground because its prolific, small, rough, evergreen leaves act like a filter, capturing particulate pollution and stopping it circulating in the atmosphere. When it rains, the particulates wash off \u2013 ending up in the soil or drains \u2013 enabling the leaves to then capture more particulate pollution.",

These findings would seem to suggest that putting schools next to busy roads is not ideal for children's health. I would be interested to see follow up studies comparing the effectiveness of these 'tredges' to urban planning techniques that reduce traffic near schools. Furthermore, it may make sense to study the relative importance of children's health versus the utility of busy roads.",

            "Those people are old enough that the negative consequences won't be their problem and they already hate their kids. No one hates their children like rich old people.",
            "Okay the real issue isn't that it'd take too much of them or that they're cost inefficient (they're quite good cost efficiency actually), it's that most of them are intermittent. Solar power provides power during the day, wind when there is wind. Just getting an average amount generated and building how much it would take for that to power everything isn't enough because you have to then store enormous amounts of energy.\n\nLike Germany has been going for wind and solar really hard but the predictions I saw were saying at like, 50% intermittent power sources it's going to be really difficult for the energy grid. Not sure where they got that amount from but Germany is at about 50% now. So either they'll show it's possible to make your energy like 80% intermittent sources or they're going to have a lot of difficulty expanding it further.\n\nThe countries that have like, more than 90% renewable energy are mostly relatively small countries that use a lot of hydroelectric power. Which you can control the flow of with dams making it suitable to base a power grid off. You have Paraguay which gets the entirety of its electricity from one enormous power plant which is co-managed with Brazil which gets the extra power from it Paraguay doesn't use. Iceland actually is small enough and volcanically active enough to use geothermal as their main source but I don't think most places are that lucky. I forget if there were other examples, I think Sweden is like 70% hydro power. But it's also an example of a country using nuclear and hydro power as their main sources. Sweden is like, basically no fossil fuels between hydro, wind, and nuclear. France though is very impressive as they're a pretty large country and their power is almost all nuclear and hydro power.\n\nAnyway the issue with hydro power is it's location dependent. You can make a power grid based off of just hydro power but that isn't going to help Saudi Arabia switch off of oil.\n\nSo I know there's research into alternate methods of storing huge amounts of energy. I know the UK has a place where they use extra electricity to push water up somewhere, then they can let the water down later to generate energy with it. There was that like... crane that stacks bricks? Did you see that? The idea of using electricity to power a crane that stacks bricks then somehow makes power by letting them down. That one doesn't seem very good. Water is probably the better way to do that but that's kind of hydro power again so you need the kind of place that could store a lot of water already.",
            "the problem with renewables is that because you have a relatively low per-unit generation, you have to build a whole lot of them which can end up being more expensive than a single nuclear reactor",
            "Regular renewables alone cannot supply a country reliably, a fact the German government freely admits. To cover the gaps in supply, other, more expensive power sources are needed.\n\nGermany is now investing billions in hopes of establishing a global production capacity for green hydrogen, thousands of kilometers of pipelines and 25 new H2-ready gas powered plants (for now).\n\nMeanwhile, the scientific preditictions for available green hydrogen and price point keep moving in the wrong direction for this plan.\n\nThat's what nuclear power is competing with in Germany, not renewables.",
            "Renewables have a lot of problems, a lot of them due to the intermittent nature of them\n\nYou can't just plug solar panels into the power grid as a whole, so you have to use them to charge batteries that then power the grid. That takes a LOT of batteries and is extremely expensive. Then in America at least, most of the grid is designed to go one way, from generator to load. If you put solar panels on everyone's homes, then it becomes a problem that the power is trying to go both ways \n\nThat's not even getting into how several of our most important power grid protection methods stop working if too much of the grid is made up of batteries\n\nWind power is different because you can just plug that into the grid, but then the intermittent issue comes back. You have to maintain enough conventional power generation to make sure that if the wind isn't blowing, people still get power. Plus other issues I'm not informed enough to speak confidently on",

Something needs to fill that gap and nuclear is a very good option that does not produce carbon.\n\nOtherwise, you need to build immensely overcapacity or a simply ludicrous amount of batteries to make it work.\n\nEDIT: Cheapest doesn't necessarily mean it's what is necessary or best for the functioning of the power grid.",

But there still needs to be long-term storage, and that simply isn't being happening for political reasons, and it's hard to justify new reactors and new plants when we still don't have a proper storage site for current waste.",
            "It's also that we kinda suck at figuring out where to bury it. Several suggested final places to bury it, at least in Germany, ended up being structurally unstable, caving in, being connected to the ground water supply, etc. So it's either filling the whole thing with concrete or getting the waste out again, which takes years. The containers are proven to be safe for 40 years, they'll likely be for longer but we still don't wanna push it too much.",

            "Back when they hosted the Olympics, air pollution in China made global headlines, with some hesitation over sending top athletes into such a climate. I imagine it was an embarrassment for the Chinese government.",
            "Since this is in r/sustainability...\n\nWould it surprise you that both the number of gas cars in use in China and the amount of coal China burns have both increased significantly since 2012?  Their GHG emissions have increased substantially.\n\nA lot of the city pollution was from coal power plants and industrial operations that weren't properly filtering their emissions.  China resolved this by both shutting down some of these plants and factories near cities, and implementing more stringent air regulations that forced those facilities to install proper filtration.  Note, this has little to no benefit for GHG emissions.  The plants and factories still pump out the same amounts of CO2.\n\nThey improved building efficiency, and probably filtration as well if they were running boilers / furnaces using fossil fuels.\n\nThey also modernized their bus fleets... I'm guessing they must have been using old buses without proper catalytic converters or diesel particulate filters.\n\nThey went all in on e-bikes / e-scooters in place of gas powered scooters / motorcycles that likely had no catalytic converters... or they simply required catalytic converters on their gas vehicles.\n\nEven though their car ownership soared, some cities restricted how often car owners could drive to every other day.\n\nThey planted forests on regions bordering deserts to deal with sandstorms.\n\nThey have been rapidly transitioning to electric cars, but only about 50% of their new car sales are electric, and they've never stopped increasing the number of gas cars they have on the roads.    To put things in perspective, in 2000 they had 25 million cars in use.  In 2010, they had 75 million cars in use.  By the end of this year they will have about 350 million cars in use.  I believe only about 40 million of those are electric.  Their number of in-use cars is increasing annually by about 15 million, so at this rate, by 2030 they'll have about 425 million cars on their roads.\n\nToday, China's GHG emissions are at or near record highs.  It's just that CO2 doesn't create smog or harm our breathing.  It was all of the other harmful particulate emissions that did.  It does, however, impact global warming over a LONG period of time.  As long as 1000 years.",

The other picture looks to be summer judging by the trees. The last big dust storm that blanketed Beijing was in 2023.

I technically had a view of the mountains, but I only saw them maybe 10 days in the year I was there. \n\nOne of the only times it looked like the bottom picture was on Oct 1st which was the 60th anniversary of the founding of PRC. Could hear them shooting silver iodide (iodine?) into the clouds from literal cannons a few days before, and it rained so much there were floods in other places, but the sky was at least incredibly blue for the broadcasts.

Very small carts and large three wheeled \u201cmotorcycles\u201d are also used for shuttling, transporting goods and supplies, and these have been converted to electric in large numbers. Last I was in Chengdu last year all of those were electric, not a single gas cart.",
            "I mean, it is commendable that they\u2019re putting effort into improving air quality in their cities in the first place- that probably will have a massive positive impact on their citizens health. It\u2019s especially commendable given their cities tend to be very dense and heavily populated. \n\nI wonder though how the air quality is in the rural areas where the coal plants are now located. We see in a lot of countries all the time how the most polluting factories and coal plants tend to be located in areas where the less privileged live, like in working class neighborhoods and/or in rural areas. Think of the location of Michigans (US) only oil refinery- Southwest Detroit- a place of high poverty and a high percentage of POC. Or in India- the Union Carbide Chemical Plant (the site of the horrific chemical leak in 1984) was located in the middle of a poverty stricken area in Bhopal. \n\nI don\u2019t live in China and I\u2019m not an expert, but I\u2019d be suspicious that China simply moved the air pollution issues somewhere else. Yes they cleaned the plants up and everything, but I doubt that completely eliminated all the pollution.",
            "Also important to consider that a large portion of chinas emissions goes into the production of products that are being ordered by other countries(which of course has also increased massively). American consumers are a huge proponent of this. The question becomes do those emissions lie in the fault of china producing them?

Because of China's heavy use of coal in their electricity production, the manufacturing and operation of EVs is among the highest carbon footprints in the world.  Using an EV sedan in China right now likely has emissions closer to what a regular ole non-plugin Prius puts out.\n\nAdding 15 million additional Priuses to their total in-use vehicles every year is still a net negative.\n\nI didn't mention anything about the US... but I'm sure if you skidaddle through my comment history, you'll find plenty of my comments calling out the excessive US per capita emissions, and insisting that we reduce the number of cars on our roads immediately.\n\nWhy is it that every time I call out China, I get so many people feeling the need to push back... as if China isn't doing tremendous amounts of environmental damage.  China's tripled their per capita consumption based emissions since 2000, which is significant given the nation has a population of over 1.4 billion people.   Sure, there are nations with worse per capita emissions that also rapidly need to improve their numbers, no one argued otherwise.  However, if more high population developing nations increase their per capita emissions as fast as China has (and continues to do)... then this planet is in for a reckoning.",

            "Sure, the USA has the worst per capita emissions of any large nation, and has for the past 150 years.  However, in terms of rate of change in per capita emissions, there is no worse country than China.  The US has reduced our per capita productions emissions somewhat in the last 25 years... mostly by moving our high emissions industries to China.  However, our consumption based emissions has also declined, largely by transitioning from coal energy to natural gas.\n\nChina OTOH, a population of 1.4 billion, has tripled their per capita consumption emissions over the same period of time.  That's very very bad.\n\nWhile China does sell a far higher percentage of EVs... remember that they're increasing the total number of cars on their roads at extremely fast rate.  In other words, people who didn't previously own a car are now buying a car for the first time.  They previously may have used far more efficient forms of transportation, like micro-mobility or public transportation.  For each person buying a car for the first time, their net emissions increases.  \n  \nEVs are not zero emissions.  The level of their emissions is based on the nation's electricity production .  China has among the highest ratios of coal energy in the world.  I believe it's about 60% of their electricity production.  That means an EV's operation in China is approximately the emissions equivalent of a hybrid.  So even if 100% of their car sales were EVs, it would be like adding 15 million additional Priuses to their roads every year.\n\nAs to the US... you will often find me arguing that the US is the worst emitter in the world, and Americans need to drastically and rapidly reduce their carbon footprints.",

I think that matters quite a bit for global warming.\n\nMany Western nations have seen their per capita emissions decline over the past 25 years, albeit from an extraordinarily high amount... yet global emissions still continues to climb.  Largely because of China.  It's a developing nation (or should I say it rapidly developed) with lots of people with a lot more wealth than they used to have, and thus they're consuming a lot more energy and products.\n\nWorse... China's also rapidly expanding their car industry, and attempting to export more and more cars to other developing nations, thus increasing those nations' car ownership levels as well.  That will certainly raise the per capita emissions of those other developing nations as well.  Especially keeping in mind that many of those nations are still using dirty electricity generation.\n\nWhile I'm all for giving the people of developing nations more equity in the world... it needs to be done responsibly.  A nation of 1.4 billion people can't rapidly increase their emissions without having an ill impact on the planet unless those nations with high emissions willingly lower theirs to offset the increase.  While Western nations have lowered their footprints somewhat, they haven't done so enough to offset the rapidly increasing emissions of developing nations.  That's a big problem.",

Peak is supposed to be at around 2030 and declining there after.\n\nThe real question is can we curb emissions by having less demand on GHG intensive manufacturing, is this plan too late for the worlds manufacturer to curb emissions for the good of the planet (probably), and can other countries bring down their footprint if we\u2019re going to rely on China to supply what we need.  Moving the manufacturing of GHG intensive processes locally isn\u2019t a solution since the effect is planet wide, but might help local economies, and the climate if they have more stringent constraints on emissions than China.

It would be nice if US strategic self interest could be better aligned with clean energy, but you have the fossil fuel lobby to thank for that.",

Green was for good air quality days when we could use all the playground equipment and do whatever we wanted. Yellow meant no running or soccer balls but we could swing, go on monkey bars, play four square, etc. and red meant no equipment, no balls, no swings or running, we could only walk in groups or sit on benches with our friends. Once in awhile they\u2019d send us to the auditorium for recesses because they didn\u2019t want us outside. \n\nI hope China and other places with pollution as bad as this picture are able to get it under control and reduce it by a lot. I moved to the Midwest but every time I go home to visit the air is better than it was before. It\u2019s such a huge difference. You especially notice it if you drive from up north or like Las Vegas coming over the Cajon pass. When I was a kid you couldn\u2019t even see the cities below most of the time and now it\u2019s beautiful.

I opened the window and put a fan in which brought things down to about 800ppm eventually. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s the placebo effect, maybe it\u2019s that I took a break to get the fan set up, but I felt like I could concentrate better after the CO2 levels had dropped.",

Quite the contrary, if 700ppm is the actual limit, I'd like to bring that up at work.\n\nWith Covid -- and CO2 often functioning as a reasonable proxy for human exhalation -- I think it would probably make sense to have a lower allowed limit. I've seen estimates that at around 700-800ppm of CO2 resulting from human exhalation about 1% of an inhalation will be air someone else in the room recently exhaled, and that this may be a significant threshold for Covid risk as well.\n\nThanks!",

Her research disproved the incorrect, 60-year-old beliefs that viruses bigger than 5 microns could not float, and that almost every respiratory virus is airborne, regardless of what medicine still claims.\n\nUnfortunately, most health experts refused to listen to her evidence and expertise which only prolonged the pandemic. And, of course, it's still causing problems today.

Can't dump them into the rivers anymore.\u00a0\nIf oil companies can't sell 70-80% of the refined product they will go out of business along with oil producers. We still need oil to make just about everything.\u00a0\nCan we use plant based oils like palm to replace the petrochemical products from crude oil? Hemp to replace polyester fibers? Maybe but look what happened to virgin forests of Indonesia and Malaysia\u00a0when the palm oil boom started. Millions of acres burned along\u00a0with the endangered animals that lived in them. Orangutans fleeing the forest were killed. Remember the smoke from Indonesia from burning those forest.

There actually is discussion now about how some fields may not be getting enough sulfur now because we aren't getting as much acid rain as we used to and increased marketing to farmers saying buy more sulfur in your fertilizer mix. Some fields do need more sulfur, but there's also a lot of selling without good merit for the addition going on too. It's a bit of a complicated discussion to get into, but at least using this paper, it is a good lead-in to say that yields overall are actually increasing with decreasing SO2 levels to help pump the brakes a bit in sulfur-related discussions.",

            "[D. B Lobell and J. A Burney, Cleaner air has contributed one-fifth of U.S. maize and soybean yield gains since 1999, *Environmental Research Letters* (2021).](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac0fa4)\n\n>**Abstract:** Crop productivity is potentially affected by several air pollutants, although these are usually studied in isolation. A significant challenge to understanding the effects of multiple pollutants in many regions is the dearth of air quality data near agricultural fields. Here we empirically estimate the effect of four key pollutants (ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)) on maize and soybean yields in the United States using a combination of administrative data and satellite-derived yield estimates. We identify clear negative effects of exposure to O3, PM, and SO2 in both crops, using yields measured in the vicinity of monitoring stations. We also show that while stations measuring NO2 are too sparse to reliably estimate a yield effect, the strong gradient of NO2 concentrations near power plants allows us to more precisely estimate NO2 effects using satellite measured yield gradients. The presence of some powerplants that turn on and others that shut down during the study period are particularly useful for attributing yield gradients to pollution. We estimate that total yield losses from these pollutants averaged roughly 5% for both maize and soybean over the past two decades. While all four pollutants have statistically significant effects, PM and NO2 appear more damaging to crops at current levels than O3 and SO2. Finally, we find that the significant improvement in air quality since 1999 has halved the impact of poor air quality on major crops and contributed to yield increases that represent roughly 20% of overall yield gains over that period.",

But Shelby further ruled that $90,000 will go to the Davis County Tampered Diesel Truck Restoration Program.\n\nThe ruling is a victory for Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment, which sued the Diesel Brothers after seeing modified trucks spewing black smoke on the Wood Cross-based truck enthusiasts\u2019 Discovery Channel show, now in its sixth season.\n\n\u201cIllegally stripped down and modified diesel trucks have no place on our roadways,\u201d Dr. Brian Moench, president of the doctors\u2019 group, said Monday afternoon in a press release. \u201cAny business that not only profits from doing that, but glorifies the plumes of pollution that their handiwork produces, should be held accountable, and that\u2019s what this ruling does.\u201d\n\nPhysicians\u2019 attorney Reed Zars on Monday applauded the \u201clifetime ban\u201d on further emissions violations. He also noted the judge\u2019s ruling ordered that none of the $848,000 \u201ccan be avoided or charged in bankruptcy.\u201d\n\nCole Cannon, the Diesel Brothers\u2019 attorney, said it is too soon to know whether they will appeal the ruling.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s disappointing is that the parties were unable to resolve this through a private settlement, which would have resulted in a lot more of a restorative effort in Utah,\u201d Cannon said. \u201cThis order only has approximately 10% of the money staying in Utah. The other gets sent to Washington, D.C., and we all know how useful that\u2019s going to be.\u201d\n\nIn court documents leading up to the decision, the doctors\u2019 group had sought more than $1 million in penalties and argued that the law allowed sanctions up to $4.4 million.\n\nBut Shelby gave the Diesel Brothers credit for various mitigating factors, such as that they earned only about $1,500 direct profit per truck of the 50 vehicles sold or given away in online sweepstakes during the five-year period addressed in the suit.\n\nWhile David Sparks, owner of the defendant companies involved and the main star of the TV show, added a disclaimer on the program saying they did not support illegal truck modifications, the judge said the defendants overall \u201cproduced minimal evidence of good faith efforts\u201d to comply with the law.\n\nShelby said the Diesel Brothers have not restored or offered to restore any of the tampered trucks they gave away in sweepstakes and that two trucks with defeat devices were sold even after the judge imposed a preliminary injunction.\n\nThe defendants can afford to pay the penalties, Shelby added, outlining in his ruling the assets of Sparks, know as \u201cHeavy D\u201d on the show, and his companies.\n\nSparks has become a celebrity with millions of social media followers and his income has \u201csubstantially increased\u201d to an average of $300,000 annually in the last three years, the judge said.\n\nSparks received $482,597 in that period from Discovery Channel alone, according to the ruling.\n\nThe Sparks Motors truck dealership doubled its assets from 2016 to 2018 and at the end of that period had a helicopter and two planes.\n\nShelby largely discounted one key defense the Diesel Brothers offered regarding the magnitude of the penalties sought, that many of the defeat parts and trucks they sold ended up outside Utah.\n\n\u201cDefendants\u2019 violations are no less serious simply because they exported their violations to other parts of the country,\u201d Shelby wrote. \u201cThe violations were numerous, occurred over a long period of time, significantly increased the toxic pollutants emitted by diesel trucks, and pose a serious risk to human health. At bottom, the tampered trucks and the defeat parts continue to endanger human health, regardless of where they are.\u201d\n\nThe judge said the doctors\u2019 group demonstrated that the Diesel Brothers caused irreparable injury by increasing the amounts of toxic pollutants breathed by Northern Utah residents and that monetary damages can\u2019t compensate for injuries suffered.\n\nSeven Utah counties repeatedly have not met federal air pollution standards, especially on the Wasatch Front. The doctors\u2019 groups says ozone and fine-particulate pollution emitted by diesel engines cause various health problems including cancer.\n\nSparks in the owner of Diesel Brothers affiliated companies including B&W Motors, doing business as Sparks Motors in Woods Cross, and Diesel Power Gear, the online merchandizing arm. Those entities also are defendants in the suit.\n\nOther individual defendants are Diesel Brothers stars Joshua Stuart, \u201cRedbeard\u201d; and Keaton Hoskins, \u201cThe Muscle.\u201d\n\nCannon said he was \u201cshocked\u201d that Shelby assessed $86,100 in penalties against Hoskins for selling two tampered trucks, only one of which he worked on.\n\n\u201cI think for a regular truck owner this would be pretty alarming to you,\u201d he said.\n\nShelby also awarded litigation costs and attorneys\u2019 fees to the doctors\u2019 group, which will be determined in future hearings.\n\n-----",

            "Genuine response to your question:\n\nRenewables are great but they can\u2019t keep up with energy demand on a large scale without sufficiently large batteries, for the key reason that we can\u2019t actually control the energy output of most renewables to meet that demand. As the easiest example: solar. We don\u2019t have control over how much sunlight we get. Nuclear reactors iirc take time to \u201cgear up\u201d so they also don\u2019t solve this issue, but the research looks very promising for the near future on that front. \n\nIt is possible that renewables will be good enough on their own in the future, but we shouldn\u2019t let \u201cperfect\u201d be the enemy of \u201cimprovement\u201d. We should have as much of our energy in renewables as possible, but nuclear (and yes, even the cleanest available fossil fuels) would still have a place in our society as an energy source that *we control the output of* to meet moment to moment shifts in energy demand. Hydroelectric batteries can do this currently, but have their own host of issues. I want to say geothermal may also not have this problem, but to be honest I haven\u2019t read up on this stuff in years. I encourage you to do more research on your own if you are passionate about the topic.\n\nThe main point I want to make here is that renewables are the future and we should all be proponents, but if we really want to make significant change I think we need to be clear and honest about the limits of the things we\u2019re advocating for. There is no switch we can flip to instantly have the perfect energy source. I want to live in a world powered 100% by renewables too, but advocating for energy sources like nuclear to help bridge the gap in the meantime is how we must fight so the world isn\u2019t a hellscape by the time that day comes.

Even more interesting is that it looks like the animals that live there are rapidly developing immunities to increasing levels of radiation.\n\nI think you are severely underestimating just how good life is at surviving. I also think it's extremely foolish to use some hypothetical race of intelligence creatures that may or may not ever exist in order to dissuade people from using nuclear energy, which is better for the environment, and much safer than fossil fuels. Even nuclear waste is becoming less and less of an issue as we become better and better at building reactors that use nuclear material more efficiently. Pound for pound, the amount of nuclear waste produced by a nuclear reactor is minuscule compared to the sheer volume of CO2 being pumped into the air by burning fossil fuels. \n\nOur planet is in crisis now. Ocean temperatures are rising, waters are becoming more acidic, global temperatures are rising, the sea level is rising, the ice caps are melting, and as fossil fuels become depleted, human conflicts will continue to increase and intensify\u2014these are not hypothetical things. These are real, tangible things that are happening right now. You can go out to the Great barrier reef and see with your own eyes the effects that burning fossil fuels has on our environments today. We know for a fact that nuclear energy is cleaner, it is safer, and it is more efficient. \n\nIt's frustrating to me when people like you bring up arguments about completely hypothetical situations, when the crisis we are facing because of fossil fuels is happening right now before our very eyes. Right now, we're looking at the very real possibility that our consumption of fossil fuels is going to be the cause of the next great Mass extinction. Why on Earth do you think that the lives of completely hypothetical intelligent rats and monkeys matter more than the lives that are at stake right now due to global warming? How many species need to go extinct, how many ecosystems need to be completely destroyed before people like you realize that we don't have time to keep looking for other alternatives? Nuclear power is the alternative. Until we manage to develop fusion reactors, nuclear fission is the safest, most efficient alternative.\n\nIt completely baffles me that you accuse humanity of being short-sighted, all while you would prefer to postulate about sentient rats instead of addressing the very real threat global warming poses to Earth today. It's a problem we have to fix right now. So that means that you have to get your head out of your ass and stop living in a hypothetical fantasy.

While on the ranges of the Western USA, Mexico, and Canada - vast, wide spaces, they eat very little grain, eat mainly wild grasses and forbs, and drink pure well water or rain water.\n\nWhen you buy Kansas or Oklahoma beef, this is the meat you get.  It goes through the butchering facility, is packed in terrible packaging (we can do better than foam and plastic wrap)  and sent off to the store fresh from the Prairie.\n\nNOW much like vegan leather which is plastic, made of oil, and produced by polluting chemical processes - Let's break it down:\n\nWhat chemicals are used to grow this faux meat?\n\nWhat type and how many plastic containers are used to grow faux meat?\n\nAre they using BPA free plastic to grow this faux meat and package it?\n\nWhat happens to the waste-run-off from the chemicals and substances from growing this faux meat?\n\nWhat are the plastic and chemical processes for all INGREDIENTS involved in creating the faux meat?  Flavors? Spices? Hemo-flavorings? How are they made?\n\nWhat cleaning supplies are used clean and process between batches?\n\nWhat happens to all plastic, glass, and fluid waste?\n\nWho transports the ingredients and products back and forth? What is the footprint of the entire supply chain from USA to Asia for all ingredients and packaging?\n\nWhat is REALLY the footprint? Because I know this isn't being made like blocks of simple tofu in a shack in Thailand by indigenous people.\n\nAND the one question I CAN answer\n\nImpossible Beef and Beyond Beef aren't healthier - they have the same calories as anything prepared with real beef, but less nutrients than the human body needs from real meat. Unless faux meat starts fortifying their product - there will be deficiencies in Iron and other vital minerals.\n\n\\*\\*also good to mention \"The circle of life\" - Cows and other delightful ungulates are PREY animals and the ecosystem depends on both their consumption and their inevitable demise by predators, injury, or old age.  Since humans have removed most of the predators of these larger prey animals we are literally responsible for our own stupid by having to cull animals and keep the balance of the Earth. I know that sounds crazy to some if when you see a cow is a cute animated, talking character and not as livestock or part of your personal survival.  To stop farming cows and to stop subsistence hunting, but not correct or cull the populations remaining would make them go extinct eventually from starvation, overpopulation, and so forth.  That's just basic systems-based science and based on the OS of the entire Earth.  So really you have to choose to have BOTH and live with it.)",

            "Remember how we are supposed to grocery shop in the outside aisles of the grocery store so we can get foods that are whole and unprocessed?   Lab grown meat has got to be one of the most processed foods a person could get their hands on.\n\nProduce grown in nature is subject to some easy and some difficult conditions.    Stressors that lead to a diversity of nutrition not found when the same product is grown hydroponically.    Try as we might, it's still not as good.   And this is simply growing the plant in a controlled environment.   We still let the plant produce the tomato rather than try to grow tomato tissue on a substrate.  Use this example as an analogue to the animal world. What makes us so sure that lab-grown animal tissue is a drop-in replacement for real thing?  Perhaps even remotely nutritionally equivalent.\n\nThe other thought that comes to mind is there are stretches of desert-edge land that farmers in Australia  have been restoring to high quality land by growing no-till crops and grazing cattle intermittently.   This land becomes much more productive and carries a much higher carbon content due to the diversity of organisms in the soil.   They have actually suggested that mono-culture farming has caused many of our world problems but that this described farming technique could solve our whole climate problem.  A few extra percentage points of carbon in the soil would drop the CO2 content of the atmosphere more drastically than anything else being proposed. Growing meat in a lab seems very much opposite to this idea.   It does provide a lucrative replacement industry for those few who control it.   Of course that's at the cost of a lot of hard-working middle class farmers.\n\nIt might be a long-time before I trust some massive lab/factory owned by a few new billionaires to feed me rather than the hard working farmers surrounding me.

            "\nAir pollution causes a \u201chuge\u201d reduction in intelligence, according to new research, indicating that the damage to society of toxic air is far deeper than the well-known impacts on physical health.\n\nThe research was conducted in China but is relevant across the world, with 95% of the global population breathing unsafe air. It found that high pollution levels led to significant drops in test scores in language and arithmetic, with the average impact equivalent to having lost a year of the person\u2019s education.\n\n\u201cPolluted air can cause everyone to reduce their level of education by one year, which is huge,\u201d said Xi Chen at Yale School of Public Health in the US, a member of the research team. \u201cBut we know the effect is worse for the elderly, especially those over 64, and for men, and for those with low education. If we calculate [the loss] for those, it may be a few years of education.\u201d\n\nPrevious research has found that air pollution harms cognitive performance in students, but this is the first to examine people of all ages and the difference between men and women.\n\nThe damage in intelligence was worst for those over 64 years old, with serious consequences, said Chen: \u201cWe usually make the most critical financial decisions in old age.\u201d Rebecca Daniels, from the UK public health charity Medact, said: \u201cThis report\u2019s findings are extremely worrying.\u201d\n\nAir pollution causes seven million premature deaths a year but the harm to people\u2019s mental abilities is less well known. A recent study found toxic air was linked to \u201cextremely high mortality\u201d in people with mental disorders and earlier work linked it to increased mental illness in children, while another analysis found those living near busy roads had an increased risk of dementia.\n\nThe new work, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, analysed language and arithmetic tests conducted as part of the China Family Panel Studies on 20,000 people across the nation between 2010 and 2014. The scientists compared the test results with records of nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide pollution.\n\nThey found the longer people were exposed to dirty air, the bigger the damage to intelligence, with language ability more harmed than mathematical ability and men more harmed than women. The researchers said this may result from differences in how male and female brains work.\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/27/air-pollution-causes-huge-reduction-in-intelligence-study-reveals\n\nStudy http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/08/21/1809474115",

It very well could be that pollution makes people stupid, but this study has not shown that. It has simply shown that areas with high air pollution tend to have students who perform poorly on tests. It's also just as likely that pollution is highest in low income areas, which also tend to have poor academic performance (so income is the auxiliary variable that may cause both pollution and poor test scores). Its cheap to build polluting factories in shitty areas, and they also find cheap labor among people with the lowest socio-economic status, which also correlates with poor academic achievement.\n\nSo remember, if there is a relationship between A and B, it *could* be that A causes B, or B causes A. Or it could be that something unknown (C) causes A *and* B. Or it could be something more complex.\n\nThe authors try to claim they have shown a causal relationship, but they only sampled 4 years, and while they can suggest causation, they rely on considerable assumptions to do so and they have certainly not proven it with any kind of scientific standard:\n\n>Chen said air pollution was most likely to be the cause of the loss of intelligence, rather than simply being a correlation. The study followed the same individuals as air pollution varied from one year to the next, meaning that many other possible causal factors such as genetic differences are automatically accounted for.\n\n**tl;dr: Just because there is a relationship between two things doesn't mean one causes the other.

This represents an average shortening of life expectancy of nearly three years for all persons worldwide.\n\nIn comparison, tobacco smoking shortens life expectancy by an average of 2.2 years (7.2 million deaths), HIV/AIDS by 0.7 years (1 million deaths), diseases like malaria that are carried by parasites or insects such as mosquitoes, ticks and fleas by 0.6 years (600,000 deaths), and all forms of violence (including deaths in wars) by 0.3 years (530,000 deaths). [2]\n\nThe researchers looked at the effect of air pollution on six categories of disease: lower respiratory tract infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease leading to stroke, and other, non-communicable diseases, which include conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes. They found that cardiovascular diseases (heart disease and cerebrovascular disease combined) are responsible for the greatest proportion of shortened lives from air pollution: 43% of the loss in life expectancy worldwide.\n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/cardiovascres/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cvr/cvaa025/5770885",

            "While some refrigerants are flammable, such as propane (R290) and ethane (R170), and some are toxic, such as ammonia (R717), the refrigerants most commonly used in residential refrigeration units are Chlorodifluoromethane (R22) and R410a, which is a blend of Difluoromethane (R32) and Pentafluoroethane (R125). R22 is an HCFC (HydroChloroFluoroCarbon) and while being non toxic (unless you're huffing it, in which case it's a nervous system depressant), non flammable, and having a very low ozone depleting potential (0.055, compare that to R13, which has a factor of 10), due to the Montreal Protocol's plan for completely phasing out HCFC's (due to the chorine content, which is the cause of ozone depletion), R22 must be phased by about 2020, by which point it will no longer be able to be manufactured. In response, R410a was developed, which, as an HFC (HydroFluoroCarbon) azeotropic blend, has no ozone depletion factor due to the refrigerants not containing chlorine (although it is a slightly worse greenhouse gas), it is also non flammable and non toxic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe articles claim that the refrigerants used in most applications are toxic and flammable (while may be true in some niche applications) is simply not the case for the broader consumer market, and a blatant misconception of the standards set by ASHRAE in today's HVACR industry.",
            "Interesting.  However, reading the article, there are two huge problems:\n\n1. the material needs to be solid to work, so the \"refrigerator\" wouldn't be a simple plumbing and pump arrangement, you'd need to build some sort of complicated hydraulic press.\n2. The material needs to cycle through *very* high pressure, around 250 MPa ~~GPa~~ (2500 atmospheres), about ten times the pressure of a scuba tank.  Making it safe for home use would not be easy.\n\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09730-9/tables/1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09730-9/tables/1)\n\nEdit: meant to write MPa instead of GPa, but I think the other comparisons, and general conclusion about safety, are correct.",
            "So thinking practically, I am having a hard time thinking of a system design that would effectively use a solid refrigerant. There is no free lunch, so any heat absorption done (plus mechanical heat gained from compression) has to be rejected outside the conditioned space. Into the outside air for most ACs and refrigeration systems, or into the ground for geothermal. \n\nWith a gas/liquid refrigerant, that is relatively easy. Pump it inside at high pressure as a liquid, drop the pressure and force evaporation which absorbs heat. Then it continues back outside as a gas with all of the heat it absorbed. Compress back into a liquid, blow outside air across the lines to get rid of the extra heat, and the cycle repeats.\n\nWith a solid refrigerant you aren't going to be moving it back and forth. It will have to alternate between absorbing and rejecting heat in place. It would likely use water, but to stick with the previous analogy. You would blow air across the solid for air conditioning for a while, and then switch to outside air blowing across it to cool it back down???\n\nEfficiency is incredibly important in refrigeration. As the article points out, it is a major energy hog. That being said, just because the solid refrigerant has an equitable heat absorption efficiency as HCFCs, doesn't mean a system can be designed with an equitable practical efficiency.\n\nMinor quibble with the article: Most refrigerants used are not flammable in a material way, and most are not toxic. While their greenhouse potential is high, there is long standing regulation requiring recovery and recycling. I have been trying to find atmospheric measurement studies tracking release for many years, but it doesn't seem to be an area of interest post \"ozone hole\" era.\n\nI am a touch skeptical of the movement to ban current refrigerants due to greenhouse potential without that data, and the fact that Honeywell and DuPont are leading that environmental push.",

When they leak into the air, they also contribute to global warming.\n\n\n\nTo solve these problems, materials scientists around the world have sought alternative solid refrigerants. Moya, a Royal Society Research Fellow in Cambridge\u2019s Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, is one of the leaders in this field.\n\nIn their newly-published research, Moya and collaborators from the Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya and the Universitat de Barcelona describe the enormous thermal changes under pressure achieved with plastic crystals.\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09730-9",

            "> Conventional cooling technologies rely on the thermal changes that occur when a compressed fluid expands. Most cooling devices work by compressing and expanding fluids such as HFCs and HCs. As the fluid expands, it decreases in temperature, cooling its surroundings.\n\nThis seems close but not completely accurate. I'm not a chemist or refrigeration tech, but I thought phase change was the biggest part of how refrigeration works in practice.\n\nYes, compressing and expanding happens, and yes, gases cool as they expand. But the primary thing that takes away heat isn't temperature change of an expanding gas. Instead, it is evaporation. The phase change sucks up a lot of heat. The compression and expansion are there mainly to shift the temperature at which the phase changes take place, right?\n\nThis is just a tangent since how existing refrigeration works is immaterial to this new research, though.",

Fluids have good material handling properties and the whole point of a refrigeration system is you are moving the heat from inside to outside.  It's all very well to have a material that cools when put under pressure, but that neglects you have to release the pressure somewhere and therefore the heat, to use it again.  Either you unload the material the same place you loaded it, which just time shifts the energy, which is fairly useless anywhere that there aren't big daily temperature swings, or you have to take that material, under pressure, outside to release the heat when you unload it.  \n\nWith the Vapor compression cycle it's as easy as pumping gas outside, and pressurized liquid inside, and letting the liquid evaporate inside in the pipes and condense outside in the pipes, thus transferring the heat energy outside.  All the material handling is done by the Compressor outside.",

These in turn were linked to near-instant decreases in local heart-related emergency department visits and hospitalizations for cardiovascular diseases, a new study shows. The impact of the closure persisted through at least December 2018, the last month for which data were analyzed.\n\nLed by researchers at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, the study was designed to assess the short- and longer-term health effects of the shutdown of the Shenango Coke Works facility, which for more than 50 years produced coke, a coal-derived product needed for steelmaking. Before closing under community pressure, the plant had incurred millions of dollars in government fines for air and water pollution.\n\nAlthough the study, performed in a real-life situation, did not demonstrate a cause-and-effect link between any individual\u2019s health and the plant closure, the results of the \u201cnatural experiment\u201d showed a strong overall statistical association between the closure and measures of improved health, such as reduced visits to the emergency department, the researchers say.\n\nPublished online July 31 in the journal Environmental Research: Health, the study showed that average daily levels of sulfur dioxide, a major toxic chemical component in air pollution and by-product of coke making, fell by 90 percent at government air-monitoring stations near the plant and by 50 percent at another air-monitoring station roughly 10 kilometers (more than 6 miles) away.

            "Press Release\r  \nCornerstone Spectrum Announces Nano Technology Desulfurization System Set For Final Testing\r  \n (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Sarasota, Fl, August 3, 2023 -- Cornerstone Spectrum, Inc. announced today that it has scheduled what is scheduled to be the final testing procedures for their focused Nanotechnology Desulfurization Filtration System.  The desulfurization system has been developed by several NASA scientists to effectively remove up to 100% of elemental sulfur and its various compounds from crude oil. The testing is scheduled to take place in Midland, Texas in mid-September.  The company anticipates that after the results of the testing are confirmed, manufacturing and licensing of the filtration system will begin shortly.\r  \nSulfur compounds are undesirable in refining process as they tend to deactivate some catalysts used in crude oil processing and cause corrosion problems in pipeline, pumping, and refining equipment.  In addition, sulfur in gasoline impairs the effectiveness of emission control systems and contributes to air pollution. Reducing the sulfur content in gasoline enables advanced emission controls and reduces air pollution. Sulfur in the fuel tends to be oxidized into SO\u2083 during the combustion process. This can then form sulfurous (H\u2082SO\u2083) and sulfuric (H\u2082SO\u2084) acids, which have corrosive effects on exhaust stacks, chimneys, etc., before being released into the surrounding atmosphere to form acid rain.\r  \nCurrently, the methodology being used by major refineries is both costly and time consuming.  These approaches comprise oxidative desulfurization, adsorptive desulfurization, desulfurization by photo oxidation, hydro desulfurization, desulfurization by extraction, C-alkylation, S-alkylation, microbe desulfurization and supercritical desulfurization.  Using the company\u2019s proprietary technology in the field of nanotechnology, Cornerstone Spectrum believes that they can reduce costs, save time and greatly improve the process for the industry. Our revolutionary technology which is implemented at initial delivery of the crude oil, removes all types of sulfur-containing molecules from all types of thick crude oil, using a proprietary metal oxide nanostructure coating that is adhered on surface of metal-screen filters of all types.\r  \nThis release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

We've been seeing record high surface temperatures in the North Atlantic this year, and it turns out that's because regulations went into effect limiting sulfur emissions from container ships. Sulfur emissions seed clouds, which block out the sun, temporarily cooling the surface. However, those sulfur clouds also produce acid rain, which is obviously very bad. Turns out on satellites images of the Atlantic, you could see the international shipping channels via straight lines of thin clouds, like you'd see jet trails in the sky. A scientist I found this study through on Twitter was discussing the idea of seeding clouds in a safe manner over the ocean to help cool it. Likely all you'd have to do is put a pump or two onto the same container ships and spray sea water high up into the air. The salt would seed clouds, and then fall back into the ocean. Sounds pretty awesome, though I'd need to see some studies on its efficiency and possible side effects first. \n\nCoal-fired power plants produce a similar cloud seeding effect, which means that shutting them down actually tends to raise temperatures a bit.

            "> The former is just consumer and worker blaming. Well they got some value so it's their fault, not the company's.\n\nI didn't say that. In fact, my point is really that blame is kind of irrelevant when there is so much to go around and no one actor is going to fix anything. Otoh realizing our own part in the problem and what we get out of it, often helps to find solutions. We got a lot out of it, our entire modern life really.\n\nI only expect companies to care about two things, costs and benefits. You know what the big problem was with SolarWinds? Cost. By skimping on security, costs go down, which allows them to offer their service at the most competitive prices.\n\nIts very hard to take two services that look identical to the user and convince them to pay more for one of them. Its hard to even make the case that a service one already uses should cost more.\n\nI am not saying the companies have been right, or the government, or that consumers are the only people to blame. However, I do think we have all greatly benefited from kicking cans down the road, and if we want to stop doing it, we should probably come to terms with why we have accepted it for so long.\n\nWhile it may be true that this detail or that was hidden, we have been manipulated and lied to.... but none of this is even a little bit surprising.

        "text": "[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7jubfl/iowa_city_threatening_a_lawsuit_to_get_me_to_take/) by u/council-throwaway in r/legaladvice\n\nAbout four years ago a large rendering plant purchased a factory in our small town in Iowa that has been causing all kinds of terrible odors ever since. We're talking rotten blood / dead animal / old beer fumes hanging in the air multiple days of the week for years. The smells are particularly nasty on warm and humid summer days.\n\nAfter living directly across the street from the plant, I decided to use my skills as a developer to create a website criticizing the government of our town and the city council specifically for taking no action and letting the factory pollute our town. At the bottom of the website, in the footer, I left a blurb that says \"$TOWN is still being polluted as of $CURRENT_DATE\".\n\nAfter a couple years of the site being up with little attention, I get a sudden spike of traffic - around 2k visitors over a few days - and we finally start hearing from the city that they'll be taking action.\n\nFirst, the city council holds a town hall and asks for everybody's complaints regarding the rendering plant and smells. They also print the name and phone number of the city attorney and ask callers to forward their complaints there. After that they begin issuing fines to the plant, which they disregard and as far as I'm aware never pay. Eventually the city sues the rendering plant, and the rendering plant counter-sues.\n\nI've updated my website after each development takes place. The last piece of news to come out of this whole situation was that each side had decided to drop their lawsuit around July of 2017 but with no agreement about the odor. I did not update the website to mention that the lawsuit had been dropped, it slipped my mind after reading it.\n\nThe domain name is along the lines of is_$TOWN_NAME_a_good_place_to_live.com and the first thing you see on the site is a big yellow block with huge text saying \"NOT YET\". It used to say \"NO\" before the city started fining the rendering plant. Everything has been quiet for months now regarding this website and the odor. While the city dropped their lawsuit and I still consider the issue unresolved, the smelly days only spring up once or twice a month now.\n\nHowever, this afternoon I received a letter from a law firm representing the city. It contains screenshots of my website, and screenshots of the GitHub repository proving that I'm the owner. The gist of the letter says:\n\n\"Our firm represents the City of $TOWN, you're the author and domain name owner of $DOMAIN, we've attached proof. You were understandably frustrated by the issues with $RENDERING_PLANT which have been alleviated through litigation. However, you have not modified your web site despite the progress made. In fact you re-registered the domain name in 2017 rather than take it down.\" (I had the domain set to auto-renew.)\n\n\"To make matters worse, the web site contains a recital that the town is still being polluted as of the date someone views the web site. This leaves the impression that the information on the site is current.\"\n\n\"I am reliably informed that the $CLINIC lost a physician prospect who read your web site. At present, the web site libels the City of $TOWN, interferes with recruitment of businesses and new residents, and negatively affects property values. That interference is likely your intention since you took the time to re-register the domain name.\"\n\n\"I am writing to ask that you take down your site and not replace it with other derogatory material. If the web site is not taken down within ten days, your next notice will be in the form of a lawsuit.\"\n\nI'm inclined to disregard this letter as my admittedly naive understanding of the law says the first amendment to the US constitution was created so citizens can criticize the government without fear of retribution. However, I realize there's a difference between Federal, state and municipal governments, and I'll be the first to admit there's a little bit of pride and defiance clouding my judgement too.\n\nNobody is being disparaged on the website except for the city council as a whole. The only person's name mentioned is the name of the city attorney and their phone number encouraging citizens to call and voice their complaints about the smells. The attorney and their phone number were being printed in local newspapers asking readers to do the same. I do mention the name of the rendering plant with a picture of their factory, but the letter I received is from attorneys representing the city, not the business.\n\nI've scheduled a consultation with a lawyer, but is it a good idea to leave this site up and risk a lawsuit?\n\nEdit: I saw the lawyer this morning who agreed that it seems like this would be violating my first amendment rights and that it's not possible to libel or defame a city. However he was unable to take the case as he's a real estate lawyer (which I knew going in, but my choice for law offices in town was the one I saw this morning or the one that sent the letter yesterday).\n\nHe did give me four good recommendations for lawyers outside of town and specifically outside of my town's \"sphere of influence\". I've got an appointment with one of these lawyers on Tuesday morning, and I've also contacted the ACLU location in Iowa as a few others have suggested.\n\nAll-in-all I'm feeling pretty confident that this letter is just an attempt at scaring me into taking the website down, though I worry that I'm slowly running out of the ten days time they've given me to comply.\n\n\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8d5sv1/update_iowa_city_threatening_a_lawsuit_to_get_me/)\n\nHello r/legaladvice,\n\nA few months ago I posted here asking for advice after the city council of the town I live in sent a letter demanding that I take down a website critical of them, or else they'd sue me. Most of the comments I received confirmed that, yes, this was violating my First Amendment rights, and yes, I should seek a lawyer.\n\nSo I did so. I set up a meeting with one of the two law firms here in town (the other law firm is the one that sent the letter), and he agreed with what everybody else had been telling me. However, he declined to represent me as he's largely a real estate attorney, and recommended I speak with someone \"outside the city's little sphere of influence\".\n\nSkipping over unnecessary details, I met with the other lawyer, but wasn't able to afford representation at the time. I updated my website to be more fair to the city itself, but risked leaving in a few barbs toward the city council and the lawyers representing them -- borrowing a few reddit comments about \" squander taxpayer money on spurious advice and pointless legal services\". \ud83d\ude09\n\nOnce I updated the website and the city realized I wasn't going to take it down, a different attorney from the city's law firm contacted me and wanted to chat over coffee. I went, although now I realize I probably should not have done so. He was very friendly, telling me he thinks the whole situation had been badly handled, but he made it clear that he thought I should take down the website because it was hurting the town and \"we both want what's best\" for it. He also told me there was a reporter from a newspaper calling around trying to get in touch with me, and he didn't think I should talk to them, again because it would damage the town. I declined the interview, because I was afraid I'd get sued (whether justified or not) if I said something the city didn't like.\n\nOf course, I was too naive to realize that the city themselves would have no problem talking to the reporter. So she ran her story, and I was made out to be the bad guy troublemaker by the city officials she interviewed. What's more, a city councilman, the mayor, and the city administrator all denied sending a letter to me. They were also quoted as saying \"there may be legal stuff coming down the road\".\n\nA few weeks later I received another letter from the law firm, and this one was... weird. It was the attorney from the original letter writing \"on his own time\" to explain all the reasons he thinks he can sue me, citing several Iowa judicial cases and going on about disparaging property. He told me I was making a stupid argument and attributing unfounded legal arguments to him. The letter ended by saying it wasn't a threat of litigation and not intended to deter me from exercising my legal rights.\n\nThis was around mid-January, 2018 (I received the first letter mid-December, 2017). Everything was quiet, once again, for two more weeks, until I got an email from the legal director at the ACLU of Iowa. On the advice of Reddit, I had emailed both the ACLU and the EFF, but after over a month with no response I had figured they were too busy to look at my case. I was very happy when she contacted me and wanted to talk.\n\nI spoke with the director and, long story short, she thought what the city was doing to me was an egregious violation of my civil rights, and the ACLU of Iowa wanted to represent me in a lawsuit against the city. Toward the end of February we filed suit in Federal court, and by March 29th we settled the case after the city agreed to these five terms:\n\n1. They had to agree to a permanent injunction where they can't threaten to sue me, or actually sue me, for any website or content I produce regarding the town.\n\n2. They must pay legal damages to me.\n\n3. They must pay attorney fees to the ACLU.\n\n4. They must write an apology letter to me.\n\n5. My favorite part, the city's staff and its attorneys must take First Amendment training.\n\nAll in all, I'm incredibly impressed with the ACLU's work on this case. I know it's not typical to file a lawsuit and win a month later, but I think just shows how blatant their attempts to censor me were. I'm super grateful to the ACLU for helping me with this, because as I said above, I wouldn't have been able to afford an attorney and the city would have gotten away with their threat. I'm also grateful to r/legaladvice for encouraging me to contact the ACLU -- thank you for all of the help!\n\n#Reminder: I am not the Original OP.",

At the time it was one of the largest cattle yards in the US.  It used to be the point where cattle drives ended and the cows would be put on trains and shipped out to processing plants, mostly in Chicago if memory serves.  Its been a long time I've no idea if any of this is still in place but the smell of manure was overwhelming.\n\nFunny that no one ever thought to complain or tried to get it changed just accepted that was how it was.  I remember my Mom saying if you lived there you just got used to it and didn't smell it anymore.  As if that made it fine to keep breathing in noxious fumes.",

The smells can be an issue, but I will assure everyone here that factories are (mostly) required to have air scrubbers that remove the toxins from any exhaust they admit. The smells don't always get completely eliminated. Still, if they're in compliance with EPA standards - they are assessed and fined for non-compliance regularly - they aren't polluting the environment any more than any other large facility.\n\nIn rural communities, these kinds of facilities are often the largest employer, especially for non-skilled and immigrant laborers, and are a net benefit in keeping towns up and running.",

You\u2019d roll into those lots and there\u2019d be small rivers of fat and reddish clear liquid coming from all of the trailers. \n\nMisstepped and got some on a pair of sneakers once. Didnt even try to save them, just wrapped them in a Walmart stack, strapped them to the back deck of the truck, and threw them away later. \n\nFucking hated hauling meat, but it did pay well.",

I\u2019m sure processing it has some benefit or they wouldn\u2019t do it.   I know many innocuous products have manufacturing processes that produce horrendous smells.  Soap comes to mind, though I guess I\u2019m not sure if modern soap is still made that way.  I\u2019m no bleeding heart vegan but I feel like if we have industry to produce massive amounts of meat, it\u2019s only respectful that we use as much of the animal as we can\u2026  \n\nIn my area, we have a large oil refinery.  Having lived here for 30 years, I can tell you the smells used to be worse.  The accident rate also used to be worse, used to be the whole skyline would just be smoke and people just said \u201coh the refinery caught fire again\u201d.   That rarely happens now.  I know that the company injects large amounts of their profits into the community because their presence make the surroundings less ideal to live in.  I imagine the reduction in smells comes from new tech and innovations in the refining process.

            "Yeah, as someone who lived in said part of town, I definitely feel for OP - the smell was *awful*. At least once a week, it\u2019d reek of what I can only describe as if you slightly burnt tripe and then left it in the sun for a week. It was even more often in the summer and November.

Nitrogen dioxide is a highly reactive gas produced during combustion that has many harmful effects on the lungs. The gas typically enters the atmosphere through emissions from vehicles, power plants, and industrial activities.\n\nIn addition to nitrogen dioxide, one of the new studies finds particulate matter pollution (particles smaller than 2.5 microns) has decreased by 35 percent in northern China. Particulate matter is composed of solid particles and liquid droplets that are small enough to penetrate deep into the lungs and cause damage.\n\nThe two new papers are part of an ongoing special collection of research in AGU journals related to the current pandemic.\n\nSuch a significant drop in emissions is unprecedented since air quality monitoring from satellites began in the 1990s, said Jenny Stavrakou, an atmospheric scientist at the Royal Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy in Brussels and co-author of one of the papers. The only other comparable events are short-term reductions in China\u2019s emissions due to strict regulations during events like the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nhttps://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020GL087978",

On a population level, yes, we should all be more concerned about air pollution. But for any given person, it's just one of many risk factors to weigh, and it's one that's necessarily entangled with confounders (income, socioeconomic status, health habits, etc.); the cause-and-effect relationship is not always clear. People who are predisposed to asthma or heart disease may see short-term effects from air pollution, but if you're otherwise in good health you really shouldn't worry too much -- particularly because there's not that much you can do. I mean, try not to, like, live right next to a freeway if you can avoid it, and don't drive more than necessary. \n\nThis is my field of research (air pollution and human health), and I personally know many scientists who do things like move their family to LA or Pittsburgh (for university research opportunities), or spend a year in China or India on a field campaign. They're obviously aware of the risks, but they're also, you know, living their lives. There's a lot we still need to learn about air quality and human health . . . while I think we all need to be more aware of the issue, I'd hate to think that I caused anybody unnecessary worry. ",

Which isn\u2019t far fetched considering the way he worshiped Elon for far longer than any person with a background in science.\n\nFurthermore, I can\u2019t stand the utterly biased way, he depicts the anti nuclear movement. Always painting a picture of an paranoid, uninformed, uneducated and unreasonable consumer. Who would rather see coal power plants, than any alternative. While there is plenty of scientists, better informed than him in the matter, who oppose nuclear power for numerous reasons, he never mentions. Like the unseen impact, that mining and refining of uranium has. \n\nNot talking about how and where Uranium is sourced may actually be one of his worst omissions. Considering that in 2020 Kasachstan mined 19.000 tonnes of uranium. Three times more than the second largest provider Canada at roughly 6.000 tonnes. The nuclear industry clearly takes advantage of the places in the world that care less about the long term impact on the environment. Worsened by the fact, that most of this supply is then distributed via Russia. Who also holds a monopoly on hexagonal fuelrods.\n\nThe Russian chokehold on a large amount of nuclear resources also explains Germanys opposition to nuclear power after reunification. Not because the reactors in East Germany were Russian built. But because East Germany was the fourth largest producer of uranium up until the reunification. To this day, the vast amount of byproducts can not be stored safely. Due to their vast quantity.\n\nWhich is exactly why the \u201edecades old easy and obvious solution to nuclear power\u201c he almost advertises in the very video you posted, is as a whole, unviable for all but the >2% of nuclear waste, that he mentions. Even so, drilling shafts that deep is neither easy nor cheap.

You're right though, it sucks that the conversation tends to be stuck on \"nuclear energy: bad or good???\" When it probably needs to be something more like \"what kind of regulatory setup would be needed to do that safely & how do we get there\"",
            "The issue is that building a nuclear power plant that does not have the safety issues of Fukushima or Chernobyl is very expensive (and also take really long, around 10 years, which, including further overhead for political shennanigans about who wants a nuclear reactor built in their province, is probably too long to decrease carbon emissions for the 1.5 or even the 2\u00b0C goal). Other renewables just seem like the way cheaper and faster bet to me compared to nuclear.",
            "That\u2019s how people are with everything. No one knows how to read data. Just look at all the antivaxxers",
            "oh it\u2019s fune. Nuclear power plants are perfectly safe.\n\njust as long as they have a steady supply of well made spare parts, and a class of trained and motivated technicians looking after them.\n\nand no country that has nuclear plants is currently going through any form of supply chain crisis, or economic or political crises that lead to budget cuts in education and hiring in the public sector.",

            "Some asshole courier uses it to power an orbital superweapon.",
            "Some of the main components for solar are made in sweatshops with horrific conditions, or mined using pretty much slave force. Granted, not that many people *die* during the manufacturing process\u2014but producing solar currently has some negative effect on average global wellbeing that nuclear doesn't (correct me if I'm wrong, but I think almost all uranium right now is mined and delivered ethically). \n\nIt's not a reason to drop solar, obviously, but it's genuinely another point for nuclear: it's the most adequate in terms of (manufacturing process + operating process + disposal process). Yeah, disposal isn't great right now, but it's not actively killing the environment either.",
            "I'm not 100% clear, but likely mostly it's manufacturing, transporting and assembling a whole lot of machinery. Individual panels produce very little energy, so canceling a nuclear power plant involves *a ton* of them, so plenty of space for accidents. Also there's some toxic chemicals in manufacturing process, but I don't know how much that accounts for.",
            "Apollo throws his dodgeball at you",
            "My understanding is that it's mostly \"people falling off roofs\". Installing Domestic solar is surprisingly risky!   \nA lot of insurers won't cover roofers in general. Working at heights is dangerous.",
            "The reflector/concentrator style solar farms could probably burn you like a magnifying glass burns a leaf or an ant."
