Before arriving, I watched a number of travel vloggers, and a couple of \"things I've learned after X years in Korea\" videos. *No one* mentioned the pollution problem. Literally not one person. Currently I'm in Busan, and the AQI is above 200. The little cartoon man on the index is *purple*, and very unhappy. I hoped that leaving Seoul would alleviate the problem, but it has not.\n\nBesides the pollution, my stay has been very nice. But the air pollution problem is the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth thing you need to know before visiting Korea, and everyone seems to sidestep mentioning the issue. If you're a travel vlogger, or an expat living in Korea, you're not doing anyone any favors by not making the pollution problem exceedingly clear. The fact that I didn't know I was walking into this, and had to learn on the ground after I arrived, is truly baffling.",

I was a little surprised. \n\nAlso, a lot of people also don\u2019t care. You should see the stupid arguments people get into when someone in other Korea subreddits posts about the bad air quality that day. Some people attack saying it doesn\u2019t matter, everyone knows already, it\u2019s not news, no one cares, it\u2019s just dust, blabla.\n\nIt\u2019s also bad because spring is known as yellow dust season. It\u2019s not necessarily man-made pollution. There is sand coming from deserts in China due to the winds. So, this is just normal for this time period (you can google about yellow dust season).",

It\u2019s a travesty that the international community turns a blind eye to China\u2019s careless attitude toward environmental stewardship and common courtesy for their neighbors to the east.

Desert sand and dust connect to pollution and make it 10x worse. \n\nI was in Beijing sometimes and could feel the gritty sand of the Gobi desert in my mouth.",

It sucks because it's the only place I've lived that I really truly fell in love with, but once I became more aware of the AQI issues I just couldn't justify it any longer. Both of my parents have dementia and poor air quality has been proven to increase risks of developing early-onset dementia. I think by the time millennials reach retirement age we'll start to see the long-term affects of poor air quality in Asia play out."

You make a very important point that carbon dioxide removal (CDR) can easily be used to prop up carbon creating industry. In fact, Exxon Mobile has spent hundreds of millions building their own direct air capture (DAC) facility and has been promoting it with the tag line \"heavy industry with low emissions\". This is greenwashing plain and simple. While DAC will likely be viable in the future when it can be powered by electricity from renewable energy, right now it is not carbon negative on balance. Additionally, Exxon's DAC stunt facility will only bring down 4,000 tons of CO2 equivalent per year. To put that in perspective, that is roughly 0.00001% of the United States emissions this year. It's a farce.\n\nBut! The reality is that we will need to remove CO2 from the atmosphere at scale in order to keep warming in check. The IPCC estimates that we will need to remove roughy 380 gigatons of CO2 between 2050 and 2100 to keep warming to +1.5C. Graphyte's approach is something we can start doing right now because it doesn't rely on lengthy, expensive R&D. The carbon removal is high quality in that it's very \"real\" in the sense that it can be measured accurately and it's very permanent - there is a high degree of confidence that the carbon bricks will stay inert underground for long periods of time (\\~1000 years).",
            "Why not just make heaps of biochar rather than going to all the effort of wrapping, burying and hoping a less carbon dense material is going to stay sealed?\n\n\nIf you pyrolyze (ie heat in absence of oxygen) that same unwrapped brick of sawdust, you get wood gas, and charcoal: a more dense form of sequestered carbon that you need not bury or wrap.",

The scientists then measured whether the flies still emitted their pheromone.\n\n>In addition to males of the model fly *Drosophila melanogaster*, the researchers also tested male flies of eight related species of the genus *Drosophila*.\n\n>Consequently, elevated ozone levels not only caused females to be less attracted to males; rather, ozonated males were suddenly interesting to their male counterparts.\n\n>In eight of the other nine species studied, the research team observed unusual courtship behavior by males toward other males exposed to ozone. \n\n>Interestingly, one species, *D. suzukii*, which is known to lack pheromones but courts based on visual cues, was not affected at all by increased ozone levels.\n\n^1 *Air pollution impairs successful mating of flies*, 14 Mar. 2023, https://www.mpg.de/19975894/0307-choe-air-pollution-impairs-successful-mating-of-flies-155371-x\n\n^2 Jiang, NJ., Chang, H., Wei\u00dfflog, J. et al.

Out of these 95k, the vast majority are in China, so adjust your rhetoric accordingly. From the paper itself:\n\nhttps://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/21/eabe1178\n\n> **Change in air pollution\u2013related premature mortality**\n>\n> Aggregating across pollutants based on monitor data, we find that changes in pollutant concentrations associated with COVID lockdowns up to 6 July 2020 resulted in \u221295,000 (95% CI, \u2212160,000 to \u221229,000) premature mortalities from NO2, PM2.5, and ozone exposure during the lockdown period. Statistically significant changes in air pollution at the 5% level contribute to \u221267,000 (95% CI, \u2212115,000 to +19,000) of the total premature mortalities. For comparison, the global death toll of COVID-19 as of 6 July 2020 was 544,000. Changes in NO2 exposure account for \u221231,000 (95% CI, 65,000 to \u22122300) premature mortalities, while changes in PM2.5 exposure account for \u221264,000 premature mortalities (95% CI, \u221295,000 to \u221232,000) and changes in ozone exposure for 300 additional premature mortalities globally (95% CI, \u2212190 to 800).\n>\n> **China accounts for 79% of the estimated decrease in total premature mortalities, including 65% of the reductions in NO2 mortalities, and 85% of the reductions in PM2.5 mortalities. For Europe, we estimate a total change of \u22126600 premature mortalities (95% CI, \u221213,000 to +380) from reduced exposure to NO2 and \u22126100 premature mortalities (95% CI, \u22129100 to +3100) from changes in PM2.5**. If different CRFs are used (see Materials and Methods), we find average mortality estimates of \u221243,000 (95% CI, \u221262,000 to \u221225,000) for PM2.5 and \u221251,000 (95% CI, \u221262,000 to \u221240,000) for NO2 (see Materials and Methods). When using cause-specific CRFs, we find that changes in ambient levels of NO2 resulted in \u22122800 (95% CI, \u221211,000 to +6000) premature mortalities from respiratory diseases and \u221210,000 (95% CI, \u221241,000 to +21,000) from cardiovascular diseases. Ambient changes in PM2.5 are found to result in \u221210,000 (95% CI, \u221214,000 to \u22127000) premature mortalities from respiratory diseases and \u221238,000 (95% CI, \u221250,000 to \u221225,000) from cardiovascular diseases. Overall, using cause-specific CRFs results in a total of \u221260,000 (95% CI, \u2212116,000 to \u22124200) premature mortalities, compared to \u221295,000 with the all-cause CRFs, with 75% of avoided premature mortalities being from cardiovascular diseases and 25% from respiratory diseases.\n>\n> **Reductions in air pollution\u2013related premature mortalities per capita represent less than 2.8% (95% CI, 0.56 to 5.1%) of the deaths per capita from COVID-19 in the United States (51) and 6.4% (95% CI, 1.0 to 12%) in Europe, but are between 2.3 and 16 times greater than the reported number of COVID-19 deaths per capita in Asia.** (Up to last July that is, so resist the urge to comment about India or the like.)\n\nIn fact, the article also says the same thing later on, but of course, even the people who should know science cannot be condensed to headlines still do not read even the articles linked.\n\n> The United States saw a more than 4% drop in airborne nitrogen oxide levels, but a less than 1% decline in ozone, the data showed. Airborne particulate matter levels remained relatively stable nationally as well.\n>\n> As a result, the United States accounted for a fraction of the reduction in \"premature deaths\" -- or deaths occurring earlier than life expectancy -- caused by respiratory illnesses linked with air pollution exposure.\n>\n> Conversely, China, which, along with the United States, is among the world's biggest polluters, likely made up nearly 80% of the global reduction in premature deaths attributed to air pollution, according to the researchers.\n>\n> The findings suggest COVID-19 lockdowns \"exerted a limited effect\" on global air quality, although some parts of East Asia experienced \"pronounced improvements,\" they said.\n>\n> \"Although the COVID-19 related lockdowns brought significant reductions in economic activities, air pollution levels did not decrease as much as had been speculated at first,\" Chossiere said.\n>\n> \"Primary pollution [from] nitrogen dioxide had the largest decreases and associated health benefits, but, with the notable exception of China, secondary air pollution [from] fine particulates and ozone did not bring significant health benefits,\" he said.\n\nIn the study, they say that long-term air pollution policies would have more impact than the short-term lockdowns.",

I'm guessing they must have been using old buses without proper catalytic converters or diesel particulate filters.\n\nThey went all in on e-bikes / e-scooters in place of gas powered scooters / motorcycles that likely had no catalytic converters... or they simply required catalytic converters on their gas vehicles.\n\nEven though their car ownership soared, some cities restricted how often car owners could drive to every other day.\n\nThey planted forests on regions bordering deserts to deal with sandstorms.\n\nThey have been rapidly transitioning to electric cars, but only about 50% of their new car sales are electric, and they've never stopped increasing the number of gas cars they have on the roads.    To put things in perspective, in 2000 they had 25 million cars in use.  In 2010, they had 75 million cars in use.  By the end of this year they will have about 350 million cars in use.  I believe only about 40 million of those are electric.  Their number of in-use cars is increasing annually by about 15 million, so at this rate, by 2030 they'll have about 425 million cars on their roads.\n\nToday, China's GHG emissions are at or near record highs.  It's just that CO2 doesn't create smog or harm our breathing.  It was all of the other harmful particulate emissions that did.  It does, however, impact global warming over a LONG period of time.

Green was for good air quality days when we could use all the playground equipment and do whatever we wanted. Yellow meant no running or soccer balls but we could swing, go on monkey bars, play four square, etc. and red meant no equipment, no balls, no swings or running, we could only walk in groups or sit on benches with our friends.

There actually is discussion now about how some fields may not be getting enough sulfur now because we aren't getting as much acid rain as we used to and increased marketing to farmers saying buy more sulfur in your fertilizer mix. Some fields do need more sulfur, but there's also a lot of selling without good merit for the addition going on too. It's a bit of a complicated discussion to get into, but at least using this paper, it is a good lead-in to say that yields overall are actually increasing with decreasing SO2 levels to help pump the brakes a bit in sulfur-related discussions.",

A significant challenge to understanding the effects of multiple pollutants in many regions is the dearth of air quality data near agricultural fields. Here we empirically estimate the effect of four key pollutants (ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)) on maize and soybean yields in the United States using a combination of administrative data and satellite-derived yield estimates. We identify clear negative effects of exposure to O3, PM, and SO2 in both crops, using yields measured in the vicinity of monitoring stations. We also show that while stations measuring NO2 are too sparse to reliably estimate a yield effect, the strong gradient of NO2 concentrations near power plants allows us to more precisely estimate NO2 effects using satellite measured yield gradients. The presence of some powerplants that turn on and others that shut down during the study period are particularly useful for attributing yield gradients to pollution. We estimate that total yield losses from these pollutants averaged roughly 5% for both maize and soybean over the past two decades. While all four pollutants have statistically significant effects, PM and NO2 appear more damaging to crops at current levels than O3 and SO2. Finally, we find that the significant improvement in air quality since 1999 has halved the impact of poor air quality on major crops and contributed to yield increases that represent roughly 20% of overall yield gains over that period.",
