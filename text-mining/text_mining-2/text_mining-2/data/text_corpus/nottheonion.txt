How can a body like that take itself seriously when shit like this happens? 

They probably didn't anyway.
Are we not even going to pretend anymore then?
It's OK we use paper straws.....
I think he will promise to donate 100 000 bikes to Africa and build a 100% green city in the UAE by 2040 to show he's very serious about the environment..
I guess if Jeffrey Dahmer was alive he would be the president of the humane society?
We‚Äôre so fucked
This timeline sucks.
If you didn't already know that we are long past the point of no return on climate change, here's yet ANOTHER slap in the belly with a wet fish.
It reminds me of the picture of the health ministers/officials who are extremely morbidly obese and unhealthy!
    No. Conflict.Of.Interest.
COP has been a captured event for a few years now
I'm starting to think like the system is rigged boys...
COP28 is kind of a joke. I've been somewhat involved in it through our company's (Fortune 50, so, big) sustainability group and while the company is obviously putting on a leadership/positive face, behind the scenes the prep for the event was equal parts messaging for what we want to make sure is included to push sustainability forward in the agreements and planning for inevitable PR catastrophes. You wouldn't believe how much crisis management pre-planning and pre-messaging was done for this shitshow.
Truly is the darkest timeline...really wish Jeff rolled a 2 instead.
Well...that's not good!
Climate change is real, but countries don't really care.
"We're having a conference to discuss the problem of mass murder, who should we pick to run it?" "How about Mao, or Stalin, or maybe Hitler?"

"Great ideas"
Has anyone in this comment section even read the article? It's actually quite insightful.
*Carbon tax for thee and not for me.*
well he is contributing to the climate change so why not
HahahahahahahahahahahahahahHahahahahahahahahaha
This is excellent news. I‚Äôve yet to stop winning after switching sides in the climate change fight. Becoming pro climate change has led to some real wins for me.
Fox in charge of the hen house.
"wins" aka bought
What the actual fuck
Technically they do play a huge role in climate change
You know I‚Äôm not one to believe in America butting into other global conflicts but‚Ä¶
We are never gonna fix the climate. Just start figuring out where your descendents will need to live and figure out how to establish yourself there.
"What conflit of interests?"
We live in a satirical comedy sketch that is bombing.
> He has extended an invitation to oil and gas companies and prioritized private-sector climate solutions. In Al Jaber‚Äôs view, the success of COP28, not to mention the broader efforts to fight climate change, hinges as much on embracing the private sector and shifting market conditions as it does on wonky negotiations.


private business got us into this mess, if the free market could solve it, it would be solved already. There are no regulations saying the free market isnt allowed to solve AGW.

Mind you also this idea is also like saying, why have taxes? lets just run the gov on voluntary donations. People who care. itll be fine. Or worse, this is like playing poker with a friend and you hate wild cards, think they mess up the game, and he says fine you dont have to use them, but he still gets to say 3 are wild but only for his hand, because you are a good guy and are choosing to ignore wild cards... you are going to lose all your money. it has to be the same game for everyone.

The reason why you CAN NOT count on the private market is competition. If one business can make more money saying fuck the planet than another business, thats what they will do. and sorry i cant vote with my feet on things like refineries.

thats why you need gov to set rules to make sure all companies play on a level playing field.

Capitalism produces wonderful things, and yeah it has flaws  but has been our best system to date at human advancement, but the things that make capitalism great for inventing things, makes it horrible for solving global problems. Competition.  sans regulation, of course any solution will use private business up the wazzooo.. solar farms arent building themselves. But without regs we will fly by all temp targets. Fuck we are seeing countries cheat on CFC agreements.. and this asshole thinks we can depend on private business to fix AGW.
I mean.. he IS changing the climate the most.
Petition to change the word **Climate Change**, who's with me?  


That man is gonna change the world's climate probably...  ***for worse***!
"We have determined that natural resource extraction such as oil are necessary for our global economic development, therefore the aforementioned activities should be exempt from carbon tax" - Probably a quote from the future.
You can have in charge either someone who has no power to make changes, or someone whose priority is not making changes.

Choose.
Look, I've long accepted we're doomed, but you can at least keep up the act.
One way to destroy enemies is to join them smiling  (but bribe/blackmail) then undermine, then neuter, so they‚Äôre dead from the inside.

We are doomed.
We're gonna put an oil guy on the Clean Jobs Commission.
Humanity is doomed and let's face it, we deserve it.
wut
Just further proof we‚Äôre doomed‚Äîcapitalism over everything
i mean - come the fuck on
we're fucking doomed
Changing the climate alright.
Greed is the deadliest sin of all.
Our environmental psychologists have convened with nature and determined that the earth simply identifies itself as a higher temperature so trying to change it would be wrong. - Oil Baron guy

I'm sure he's very progressive.
That's like Gotham choosing Two-Face as a mayor.
After reading through the article I came to the comments absolutely certain that a fraction of the people had actually read past the headline.

Never change reddit.
Al Jaber has one job and one job only - to delay the transition to renewable non-carbon producing energy for as long as possible while continuing to increase the use of fossil fuels globally.

This is is only real mandate. Anything else he says can effectively be dismissed as outright lies and propaganda.
Why isn't this an onion article? It literally reads exactly like one. If I saw this on the onion I wouldn't even question it. Why are we in the dumbest timeline.
We are so fucked, apparently global warming is a joke yo these people.
When are we taking out the pitchforks becausse I would like to have kids one day please

Er, any aliens out there? Can I hitch a ride?

I'm the greatest hitch-hiker in the galaxy.
Most of you Reddit people are all ignorant and closed minded when it comes to anything ‚Äúdirty energy‚Äù - like Jesus you‚Äôre typing on a device brought to you by the very industry you tear down any chance you get. 

Be forward thinking and stop being bigots - realize that these people have children too, and that they want to them grow up without risk of death and disease. They still want to be able to go outside and do things like everyone else.  

Pretend for a minute that you actually care about the environment instead of virtue signaling and you‚Äôll realize that this is the best choice. Who better to know how/where to clean up the industry than an insider with power and knowledge to clean up the industry? 

Maybe they should have elected someone from the ‚ÄúJust Stop Oil‚Äù campaign - solve the issue by throwing paint on the Eiffel Tower or something
Look at that fuckin nerd.   Looks like middle east Bubbles.

What?

That about sums it up.
Well they are changing the climate
LMFAO I just read an article about how People give up on climate change. Now this, really couldnt time it better, buckle up its about to get real fuckin weird.
Fuck
I wonder how much was paid for that position.
Yeah, leaving the fox in charge of the henhouse should world great...
Lolololol
Cannot make this shit up.
Oh we're changing it alright.
It's about time someone gave this man some well deserved recognition for his efforts.

Don't laugh but this could possibly be a good thing.

If an actual climate scientist or someone without oil and gas background was the head of this meeting, his or her ideas would be dismissed out of hand and not given a second thought. This guy at least could get the attention of major oil producing nations and companies and speaks their language.

At the end of the day oil companies are incredibly powerful and influential and will do as they please. Best you can hope for is small incremental change in the general right direction.
It's kind of encouraging to know that there's actually not that many absolute psychopathic humanity traitors in the world and that we know who they are.
In other news the fox wins presidency of henhouse.
Makes sense.  Afterall, we put the most belligerent nations on the Human Rights Counsel.
Lol
We are truly living in a parody reality.

Im not sure why everybody is complaining. I mean he is really good at helping climate change come along.
Technically he‚Äôs been working very hard to change the climate
Greenwashing deluxe!
Welcome Mr Wolf to the henhouse.
Asteroid wen?
Yeah, they seem to have gotten the wrong message about advancing the climate change cause.
Hey I have an idea: Each country on earth commits a small percent of their GDP to fund a global government. Countries that fail to reduce their CO2 emissions on schedule will have their CO2-emitting infrastructure bombed by the global government until enough has been destroyed to put them back on schedule. DONE.

I'm kidding a little bit, but unless there is an international body with the ability to *enforce* international CO2 regulations, we will never conquer our petroleum addiction. Putting people in charge like this doofus, who believes that the private sector will voluntarily reduce its emissions, is absurd.
It‚Äôs fine‚Ä¶ everything is fine‚Ä¶. lol
