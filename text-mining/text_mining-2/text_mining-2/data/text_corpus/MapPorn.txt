So glad to see that Mexico has escaped climate change.
lol Mexico is also part of North America

It seems to inversely correlate with the states/provinces that have been reliant  on dirtier energy sources.
Also Angus Reid:

Percentage of Canadians who believe climate change is real by 2021 vote:

* NDP: 90%
* LPC: 87%
* BQ: 83%
* CPC: 36%

Sadly, that doesn't include the Greens (!) or the PPC. But it shows that the problem is less of a *regional* problem than a *political* problem.

Another stat for the "all parties are the same!" crew.
What a sad sad map.
Vive la différence
I understand why this map chose the scale it did (to show better contrast), but I think it would have been much more natural to show it on a scale from 0 to 100 than a scale of 50 to 70. This way, you can mentally estimate the percentage in a region by looking at a color more easily.

If you look at the map quickly without reading the legend, it looks like the majority of the US doesn't believe in human climate change, when this isn't the case at all once you read the legend.
based french speakers
All it takes is having a working memory longer than 10 years.
I am ASTOUNDED that more than 50% of my conservative state believes in man-made climate change. 

I don't really know why, though. I know how the electoral college works.
Of note that the reddest states and provinces are known for their oil, coal, natural gas, and mineral extraction.  


 I'm guessing Alaska would be higher. Maybe the native population or it's northern latitude makes belief slightly higher? 
I can't imagine why oil sands land would disagree about the human element /s
The high level of global warming awareness you see in Quebec, the Maritimes, and Newfoundland & Labrador, is largely because many of us who live in these provinces see it first hand with the lack of icebergs and spring ice in the North Atlantic, Gulf of St. Lawrence, Labrador Sea and Hudson Bay.. it doesn’t always get cold enough for it to freeze anymore.. The warming ocean temperatures have allowed species who have been historically rare in our waters, to spread their range into more northern latitudes.. I’m lookin at you, orcas. Northern indigenous cultures in Quebec and Labrador see it in the premature melting of snow and ice, starving polar bears, and melting permafrost… as for the large percentage of us who acknowledge that human activity is partly to blame? It’s because we aren’t fucking stupid. Even fucking Texas is smarter than Alberta, Jesus Christ…
What happened with America when people think they have to have "opinions" about factual information? How do they think they are qualified to understand the science behind it? You can't "agree" or "disagree" with facts. Either you're not stupid and accepts them or you're a moron. Like reality doesn't care about whether you believe in it or not. It's still the reality.
Fench quebecois being the only sensible people in northern america
Alberta lol
Clear inverse relationship between beliefs and oil production in Canada
Proud to be part of the dark blue area
Every damn map of America is the same.
For reference iirc when you add people in Canada who believe climate change is real but humans aren’t significantly contributing the number goes up to 89% of Canadians, which can explain the difference between this map (66%) and others you may have seen on this sub.
Wait. People think humans aren’t causing climate change?
Red = Idiots. Good ol' berta', makes sense. Canada's Texas.
Eastern Canada gets it because we see it, plain as day. 

I live in a rural area, and usually pay someone to clear my driveway when it storms. We pay about $500 for the season, whether he is needed or not.
He’s only been here 3 times this season. 

When I was a child in the early 1980s the snow banks caused by plows would get so high you could climb to the top and grab the power lines, not that anyone would. 

Towns built close to rivers flood every year.  The summers here are unbearable. We get sharks here that we’ve never seen before.
And… thats why i am embarrassed to be from alberta

Our mountains and wilderness there is outstanding. One of my favorite places on earth. Hate that they are so intent on ruining it.
Bad colour scheme and starting from 50 instead of 0?
Climate change is cyclical. It would happen with or without us. We are, however, greatly exacerbating the process.
In the case of Alberta and Quebec it's entirely a tale of two industries.

Alberta is home to the lion's share of Canada's petroleum industry and on its own is closing in on becoming the world's 4th largest oil producer. It is responsible for the largest share of the country's net exports. The Athabasca Oilsands which are primarily found in Alberta have more oil in them than all of the world's other reserves combined by some estimates, but Alberta's reserve estimate is usually only listed as the 3rd largest because of a nearly 20 year old "economically recoverable" estimate which is just 10%. Current estimates based on actual operations and newer technology could be much higher.

Québec on the other hand has vast hydrologic resources and is home to 59 hydroelectric dams. With a dozen of those producing over a gigawatt. Most of these are controlled by a single provincially owned entity (called a Crown Corporation in Canada) called Hydro Québec which then sells much of that energy to the US North East. Québec is also home to one of two active lithium mines in Canada.

So before anyone gets to imagining that there's a moral dimension to this map. What it actually represents is how  different geological and geographical endowments have put the economic self-interests of these provinces into opposing camps.
Humans ended the ice age
Well then half of north America are in for a rude awakening
I wonder how closely this correlates with spending on public schools for the US? Also, as an American, this is embarrassing.
climate will change with or without humans. The globe will warm at an unprecedented rate only with humans.
Red = Trump voters
I’m sure it’s total coincidence that dark red is correlated with economies completely dependent on oil, gas, or coal extraction
When I was 5 years old my Irish Dad took us out of Alberta and back to Ireland. The money was great, he had a free house with the govt job, the (Northern) Ireland we returned to was in violent conflict. Still, he didnt hesitate. It was a redneck, anglo-saxon kip then and clearly not much has changed.
I'm surprised Alaska is that low. If you go there and ask any older resident, they'll tell you how the snow is coming later than it did years ago.
That's very low everywhere.
Alberta; Quebec's retarded cousin.
Based Quebec
Fuckn alberta
More and more I feel like I’m meant to move from Alberta to Quebec. I was born in the wrong province
TERRIBLE color-scheme...but purposefully done, I'm sure.
God I hate how much Alberta just sucks big oils balls
Yet another reason why Quebec is the best province.
Good Ol’ Alberta. For a highly educated province, ignorance runs rampant.
WTF Alaska?
So it’s like directly related to politics hmm
It’s interesting how the argument went from „there is no climate change at all“ to „there is climate change but humans didn’t cause it and can’t do a thing about it“.

Next up: „humans caused climate change, but now it’s to late anyway“
We’re not gonna make it, humans I mean?
This is depressing
Classic Quebec W
I'm so fucking sick of the level of willful ignorance in the US when it comes to climate change and other science topics. It's goddamn infuriating.
As a European it’s crazy to see more than half of us not beliving in climate change, like are they just  straight up dumb?
French cultural exception.
The bluer it is, the more French there are.
French speaking : smart
Mid west : midwest
Dear Alberta, stop embarrassing Canada. 
Wanting to be like Texas isn't a compliment.
Sorry mes frères québécois that you have to leave with all these Anglos
So what I’ve never understood about the “debate” around climate change is this: even if you don’t agree that humans are causing climate change, shouldn’t you want to take steps to ensure that we stop it from progressing? I’m not an expert but this has always confused me.
The question is really poorly phrased, we are not causing it, we are a major contributor to it. But without people, the climate would still change.
*(excluding Mexico)*
North Dakotans are soo dumb lol.
So sad, I’m only in my 30’s and the climate has gotten noticeably warmer in just my lifetime. So much anti science propaganda in the US.
Ask folks in the Canadian arctic and that’s the only response that matters.
Terrible color scale (only the darkest red is actually below 50%).
As an Albertan - this is embarrassing.  Yes, I’ve said that before.
TDIL Alberta  is more redneck than texas,therefore texas is alberta south
How was the question formulated when asked?
The problem might be with the phrasing of the question. Are humans causing climate change? Well, context. Did climate change happen before humans? Yes? Then no humans aren't causing climate change. Influencing it for sure, but not creating it in a world where it just otherwise didn't exist.
Little blue islands of sanity, floating in a sea of red tinhats.

^(Edit: and look!  One of the tinhats just DOWNVOTED me!  How...cute! Anti-science is so fun.)
If anything this map is undeniable proof that Anglos are morons
This legit makes me so hopeless.
Well it's probably because of the wording.

Humans didn't cause climate change (it has always been happening), we've sped it up.
Even though the colouration might portray it a bit worse than it actually is, 57% is still more than half which is baffling to me.
We have a lot of work to do.
kentucky is super deep red, and it’s only cause of our huge coal dependency and the jobs based around it. meanwhile over the last decade we’ve lost our four season climate and now we just have hot summer and shitty Fall/Spring/Winter all mixed into one season, it’s crazy what people will believe
Wonder why the 3 coal states and the two oil shale state/provinces are under 50%?
Rahhhhhh!!!!!! 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🏒🏒🇨🇦🇨🇦🍁🇨🇦🏒🏒🇨🇦🍁🍁🏒💪💪💪💪
Sounds like an option 🤣🤣🤣
Such good porn
I wish I knew the actual numbers for each state, and even separating out some cities-vs.-the rest of the state, the population shares in that comparison or something, etc.
Not me thinking this was universal knowledge we all agreed on
I am concerned
Berta lol
Ontario trending higher than BC is kind of surprising to me..
I will just quote IPCC AR 2023 report (IPCC\_AR6\_SYR\_LongerReport.pdf), page 47: Warming of global mean surface air temperature since 1850-1900: *likely* range of human contribution (\[0.8-1.3°C\]) encompasses the *very likely* range of observed warming (\[0.9-1.2°C\]).

*Likely* in their terms means >= 66% confidence. If IPCC has this, not sure why everyone else should have more.
Embarrassed Maryland isn’t bluer
This is actually an intelligence scale map, sorry wrong data
How is there no data in the territories? There's like 90,000 people between the 3, just ask them.
I am so proud that my province is more delusional than Texas and Florida.  At worst, I thought we were tie them.
Uh, map is missing most North American countries
we're fucked
It either is or isn’t.  Opinion doesn’t matter.
Yeah dude a lot of people claim climate change isn’t caused by humans but deep in their stupid brains they know it is, they just have to keep up appearances.
Not even California…? That’s depressing
Unfortunately, science doesn't care about your uninformed opinion.
So fucked.
Ha Alberta
How is this not over 99.9 %?
We Alaskans are completely fucked by the climate crisis. Fairbanks and Anchorage (and its surrounding areas) people should really step out of their cities and see what the hell is going on in the villages.
