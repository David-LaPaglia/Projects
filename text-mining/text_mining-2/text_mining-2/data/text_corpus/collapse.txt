Submission Statement: According to a new study, it suggested that any potential advanced high tech alien civilization **will destroy its own planet within 1000 years from climate change, even if it relies solely on renewable energy.**

In the article, it stated that "**there is no perfect energy system, where all energy created is efficiently used; some energy must always escape the system. This escaped energy will cause a planet to heat up over time."**

" A buildup of energy leakage, even from green energy, will eventually overheat any planet to the point where it is no longer habitable. If energy levels aren't curbed, this disastrous level of [climate change](https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/climate-change) could take less than 1,000 years from the start of energy production, the team found."

"When astrophysicists simulated the rise and fall of [alien](https://www.livescience.com/space/extraterrestrial-life) civilizations, they found that, **if a civilization were to experience exponential technological growth and energy consumption, it would have less than 1,000 years before the alien planet got too hot to be habitable. This would be true even if the civilization used renewable energy sources, due to inevitable leakage in the form of heat, as predicted by the laws of thermodynamics**. The new research was posted to the preprint database [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06737) and is in the process of being peer-reviewed."

While the astrophysicists wanted to understand the implications for life beyond our planet, their study was initially inspired by human energy use, which has grown exponentially since the 1800's. In 2023, humans used about [180,000 terawatt hours](https://ourworldindata.org/energy-production-consumption) (TWh), which is roughly the same amount of energy that hits Earth from the sun [at any given moment](https://sos.noaa.gov/catalog/live-programs/energy-on-a-sphere/). Much of this energy is produced by gas and coal, which is heating up the planet at an unsustainable rate. **But even if all that energy were created by renewable sources like wind and solar power, humanity would keep growing, and thus keep needing more energy."**

In this case, the flooded house is the atmospheric temperature of a planet. **A buildup of energy leakage, even from green energy, will eventually overheat any planet to the point where it is no longer habitable**. **If energy levels aren't curbed, this disastrous level of** [**climate change**](https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/climate-change) **could take less than 1,000 years from the start of energy production, the team found.**

The research also discovered that "Instead of accepting extinction or developing the technology to move energy production off-world, a civilization could choose to flatline their growth". Referring to Manasvi Lingam, an astrophysicist at Florida tech and a co-author in the study:  "If a species has opted for equilibrium, has **learned to live in harmony with its surroundings, that species and its descendants could survive maybe up to a billion years".**

This is collapse related as this study on alien civilization is a good case study for the modern human industrial civilization which is obsessed with growth and technological advancement. **It can be deduced and insinuated that even if we transitioned to renewable energy, modern human civilization will still collapse due to the massive heat build up of the planet leading to climate change** due to energy use even if we also utilize solar and wind power instead of fossil fuels.

It suggested that renewables whether solar panels, wind turbines, nuclear and electrification, etc. aren't the solution to our predicament; the only solution is to immediately halt our growth, stop our technological progress, accept a massive reduction in our living standards and material wealth, and learn to live in harmony with Nature.

 Please reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1fwt9c6/alien_civilizations_are_probably_killing/lqh0lt7/
The ideology of endless growth is the most dangerous religious cult of all time by far.
Basically waste heat which is created by any mechanical activity.

Waste heat is 10% of effect of climate change now. At 2.3% growth for a century it 10x's, so it is as bad as climate change in one century and 10x worse than climate change in two centuries. This is true regardless of energy type.

So yes, thermodynamics sets hard limits to growth. But that exponential growth is self terminating shouldn't be a surprise to people on this sub.
Well. 


That would explain why we've never had aliens visit here.


They all destroyed their own planets, just like we're doing.
Ive been saying that for years: climate change caused by burning of fossil fuels is the great filter
This study says way more about our current condition right here right now than it does about anything else.
> if a civilization were to experience exponential technological growth and energy consumption, it would have less than 1,000 years

Someone is _really_ desperate for column inches if this ChatGPT-grade tosh seems worth reporting.

This whole article is just the most obvious bullshit padded out to hell and back with vapid, humanocentric assumptions.
Most evolutionary lines end up in dead ends. On a universal scale, the likelihood is that includes us. 

At some time, though, one evolutionary line does result in success, and breaking through a previous great filter threshold. The result should be an evolutionary explosion, with the simultaneous transcendence in many places, and sudden explosion of life all across universe making itself known to its neighbours. 

I reckon the threshold is those cultures who heed the early warnings, and adapt in response; i.e. they get their collective shit together and take radical collective actions before they destroy themselves.
I sorta hope there's a star trek alien council and they're just watching us and all doing facepalms. "Well that's another civilisation gone to not working together. What's going on in the sombrero galaxy?"
How could they possibly conduct a study on this when n=1?
Only humans would have the audacity to project their own bullshit on to other civilizations. As if there's NO other way to progress besides what we've done. Dumb article.
I can’t imagine every species is as stupid as we are
There is no reason for humanity to keep growing once labor is automated.  The important political point is not to let this happen via some kind of ecofascist extermination. 

This is why the vast majority must realize a true democracy before the advent of total automation.

I advocate for the widespread acceptance and encouragement of homosexuality and other forms of non-procreative sex.
Well, we can be certain of one civilization killing itself through climate change.  Such a bummer.

This is anthropogenic bs. Any advanced and intelligent species wouldn't be driven by paranoia to compete against itself using chemicals that end the world. 

This is yet another justification of our own stupidity.
This seems to be based on a problematic set of assumptions and an anthropocentric bias.

First, the main issue with human-caused warming is not waste heat, but the fact that its energy source has been locked up underground for millions of years and effectively removed from the system. If we're making an argument about waste heat from systems that are inherently not perfectly efficient, we must assume that these alien civilizations are also using supplementary energy sources. Pretty big assumption that other planets would also have the correct conditions to create fossil fuels, and create them in adequate quantities to be a substantial factor, and then that intelligent aliens on these planets happen to discover these reserves, and that they learn to and choose to use them as fuel. On the other hand, if they developed industrialization on an alternate energy source, such as harvesting solar energy directly or maybe even from some form of bioengineering to collect energy from photosynthesis, there would be no "waste heat" to speak of. You collect energy that's already in or entering the system naturally, the waste heat adds nothing to the equation.

Second, putting a year target on how soon these civilizations collapse themselves makes a ton of assumptions that are very biased. First and foremost, is the assumption that they consume at the same rate as us, and that they grow their population at the same rate as us. We identified this warning problem early enough to curb it, we just chose not to. Who's to assume that other intelligent civilizations are as self-destructive and short sights as we are? Maybe they choose to limit their consumption and limit their growth for self-preservation. It also assumes that they have similar lifespans and reproductive rates as us. A species that lives for ~1000 years instead of ~100 may have a psychology that's more focused on long term consequences. Likewise, if their lifecycle was proportionate and they produced 2-3 offspring around age 250, they would likely not grow their population at a pace that would collapse their civilization in 1000 years. It's not biologically impossible, we know there are complex organisms on earth that live for multiple centuries. Environmental conditions can influence lifespans and metabolisms, but physical processes should be the same everywhere. Maybe we're the outlier, maybe we are consuming ourselves to death because we naturally mature and reproduce at a rate that's unsustainable. Maybe that's why we don't see evidence of other intelligent civilizations too. If species that live 10x as long and mature at a proportionally slower rate are more suited for sustainability from a physical aspect, we may just be early to the party and will probably be long dead when "peak civilization" in the galaxy occurs. 

Basically I don't think this study is worth much. Its presumptions are only really valid on Earth, at least as far as our knowledge of other planets currently extends. And we have no other examples of independent life to base any other projections on.
We are the aliens and the statement suits perfectly well for us
Super helpful speculation about things we have zero evidence even exist. I hope they do a followup study about Narnia.
Climate change is one of the best candidates for “great barrier” status and yet people love to act as if it’s some made up science that doesn’t matter. 

Imagine if people treated nuclear science with the same apathy and arrogance as climate change. We would’ve all died in a nuclear explosion decades ago.
Alien civilisations are probably eating popcorn as they watch us kill each other.
Funny thing is, I wrote a similar piece long time ago, but it's rather capitalism with its growth paradigm that is the culprit here: [https://www.konicz.info/2017/12/11/eine-frage-der-raumzeit/](https://www.konicz.info/2017/12/11/eine-frage-der-raumzeit/)
I heard there was a sci-if story that postulated that nearly every civilization has a World War II scale conflict of democracy versus totalitarianism, however few species survive it because the conflict starts AFTER they have already developed nuclear weapons. In that story, humans and the few other aliens who go onto achieve spaceflight are just fortunate to have developed nukes either during the conflict (enabling the side who gets it first to win) or after. This kinda reminds me of that.
From a Nature Physics commentary, 2022:

"Selecting a mathematically convenient growth rate of a factor of ten each century (corresponding to 2.3% per year; roughly commensurate with the human enterprise in recent times as shown in Fig. 1), our present-day expenditure at the level of 18 TW (18 × 1012 W) extrapolates to about 100 TW in 2100, 1,000 TW in 2200, and so on. In a continued progression, we would exceed the total solar power incident on Earth in just over 400 years, the entire output of the Sun in all directions 1,300 years from now, and that of all 100 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy 1,100 years after that. This last jump is made impossible by the fact that even light cannot cross the galaxy in fewer than 100,000 years. Thus, physics puts a hard limit on how long our energy growth enterprise could possibly continue."

It is a simulation based on imaginary assumptions. We have observed, at this point, exactly zero alien civilization. Anyone who has done any simulation work knows that you need to calibration your simulation with actual data.

Otherwise, it is just a video game, abate one with fancy mathematical models.
This reminds me of that story where a scientist built space probes to study alien civilizations. When the probes returned, they reported exactly one outcome: no matter how advanced, the alien civilizations always end up destroying themselves. 

The scientist went mad and unleashed all kind of horrors beyond comprehension upon his own people. His reasoning being that if his people can't even defeat those horrors, then what hope they have to avoid the dead ends of countless planets?
That’s it. This is THE great filter. The obvious answer to the Fermi Paradox. And I t’s just math.
Lmao cope more, humanity
r/nottheonion
Makes sense. Our civilization demands perpetual growth in a finite system of a planet, even if it’s so big most people don’t realize it. I could 100% see an advanced civilization having caps on planetary population/energy consumption to keep the planet habitable long term. The civilization only grows as it settles new planets.
This assumes that they are as stupid as is. Impossible to imagine but some species might recognize carrying capacities and respect nature early on maybe they aren't even ruled by greed.
Everyone here talking about growth but I see no mention of it in the article. Even if we stopped growing our economies and switched to full on renewables, just maintaining our civilisation would still end up with the same result, just postponed by a great many years.

There is no solution to this equation which eliminates waste heat.
Soil building is the play here. 

We learn how to build biospheres in space and get the fuck off this rock, building soil in space, and living there.
This, we can't be certain alien civilians will be beholden to such a cult. Rampant consumerism and cannibalistic  capitalism aren't  necessary  for technology to develop. Our own bodies are full of untapped energy.
The idea they'd have to "flatline" their growth, like assuming they'd have explosive growth before for some reason, is just absurd
I'm really glad you posted this. I really think a great filter exists of a species ability to grow sustainably within its environment without destroying it. We're finding that now. If we had developed differently (such as maybe without borders, groups, different economic system) we could've changed our behavior without resulting in collapse

But alas, here we are
I don’t buy that this is inevitable. It is possible for us to 1) control our climate and 2) to live in bubbles — given enough advancement. Given the virtually infinite alien worlds, it seems unlikely that NONE of them are able to control their climate or build bubbles to live in.
“Venus, planet of love, was destroyed by global warming. Did its people want too much, too? Did its people want too much?” -Mitski, Nobody
Of the millions out there you can bet many of them are, esp those similar to us who should know better as a whole but lack the will power to make those doing it heed. There’s also ones destroying themselves with the atom, disease and things no fault of their own even for advanced civilizations such as cosmic causes.
While I agree we are on a path of self destruction I don't think its right to assume that there are not ways to harness energy without destroying the planet which is inhabited. The assumption here is based on human technology. We don't have a full understanding of the universe or physics but have touched on the subject of them both. The article May be correct but its impossible to assume what other alien races could be capable of intellectually. Consider the difference of intelligence between us and our pets. Now estimate the difference in intelligence between our pets and insects. We may be at the level of insects intellectually when compared to alien races and I believe that evolution and the environment in which that evolution occurs could drastically effect the level of intelligence a species is able to achieve. Expecting that any other alien race would evolve exactly as we have at the pace or level we have is sorta a bad way to think.
Said by the ones who are literally doing just that and can’t imagine anything else better, ok.
No, many of them are probably smarter than us. 
This has been my position for at least 10 years.
See we are not all that different can’t we all just get along
Any sufficiently advanced civilization could apply https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_daytime_radiative_cooling for direct heat removal or any other reflective materials to reduce energy absorbtion from the star. More complicated solutions would be atmosphere engineering or space engineering to increase atmosphere reflection/reduce incoming radiative flux.

Yes, study is right that without considering the heat removal from planet as a whole - it would eventually overheat. But at the point where it starts to overheat from purely renewable sources - you would have so much energy in a whole that solving that heat imbalance should be easy.
Let me below your mind, to these aliens, we are the aliens, and they have probably also performed a study whereby they found that any potential aliens were doomed within x years of unlocking Pandora's energy box.
Ironically the ones that survive the threshold are probably victims of global catastrophies that caused massive population losses after the buildup of technological advancements. I'd love to see a model incorporating a worldwide population drop off of 40-60% after the rise of computer microchips, synthetic fertilizers and vaccine advancement.
I was of the opinion that Human population will peak and level off like it has been all over the world in developed countries. If energy requirement is correlated with population level, wouldn’t demand for energy also level off…?
A Livescience about an Arxiv that was submitted a month ago?
Build a dome!!
Yeah the climate changed like it did on Mars & Venus.

Although, I’d bet good money under the Martian surface by the water something is alive
It’s called the great filter. Yes given what we know about the elements that make up our universe — any advanced civilization will burn itself out with carbon heating up the atmosphere to a point that cannot stain life optimally.
In simple words, anyway we're all gonna die what ever we do...
*"We'll we're burning the whole thing down to service the needs of a few hundred psychopaths and it's clearly the best system so it stands to reason that all other species in the entire universe would inherently do the same thing!"*

All I can say is I'm glad we won't be around much longer. The universe will be well rid of us.
I think there is an important omission here: it should say 'no longer habitual *by us*'.

As George Carlin once observed, the *planet* will be fine. *We're* the ones who will be leaving.

Another observation: doesn't that level of growth require resources that are considerably unavailable to us?  Also, who says that every possible civilization will take the same developmental trajectory that we have?
Guess the Great Filter theory finally is popping up
1000 years huh?  We are on track to do it in under 300!
The stupidity of this is beyond compare.

If this were true, even before humans, the sun itself would cook the earth as "no energy could be lost". 

They even say this about renewable energy.  "This escaped energy will cause the planet to heat up over time". Oh no! My oven is 450f and I need it to be 350f but it's stuck like this forever now even if I turn it off! 

The earth has been through countless warming and freezing cycles. it can radiate heat into space. If it couldn't, planets would just heat progressively around their respective stars. How this managed to be published is beyond me. 

This also completely disregards the idea of the civilization developing technology to control their own climate. Something we are actively doing now. 

Conservation and being responsible stewards of the planet is important, but this goes beyond fear mongering, this is just flat out stupid and wrong.
No, just us I think.
Only the greedy dumb ones
"They tell us “be realistic.” But there is no old way, no new way, there is a way of life. We must live in balance with the earth. We MUST do it."

-John Trudell of the AIM, "Take back the earth" (speech available on youtube)
This is why a global cultural shift to center and elevate Indigenous voices and knowledge is imperative to surviving collapse. Indigenous sciences and life ways are the only solution to sustainable life on any planet. With tens of thousands of years of sustainable lifestyles, nobody is better qualified to lead humanity into the new ages than Indigenous peoples. But considering how persecuted and repressed Indigenous cultures have been since the rise of western 'civilization', it will be a major uphill battle to say the least.
Capitalists cant imagine anything other than infinite growth lol
Have they taken geoengineering into account?
The only thing that gives me some hope for anyone else out there is that our sample size is 1, so we only have our own history and characteristics to draw conclusions from. It's just as possible that most alien races form global governments early on and work towards goals in unity. The human need for conflict and greed could be an exception rather than a rule, although we'll probably never make it far enough to find out for sure
In short capitalism is bad.
So tribal citizens have it right. Live in harmony with nature and see ourselves as part of the ecosystem, not above it and exploit it. We can live within our means and not let it run out.
[deleted]
Civilization is a heat engine.
That's not a study, that's an 'gedankenexperiment' with a little maths.


A study would need a sample size bigger than "1" (us). So we can really stop at that anthropocentric starting point.


Even for an gedankenexperiment it's cheap, because the axiom/hypothesis starts with : they are a patriarchal, capitalist society, that excludes half of the population and turns the natural world into commodities, is build on endless growth and, therefore,  by nature self destructive.


There could be egalitarian, collectivist, environmentalist no growth, circular economy societies in theory, that only allow certain technologies for scientific advancement.


Example: such a civilisation could discover coal and the steam engine, but then decides not to use it at scale due to environmental concerns, but for research and does it until they figure out a combustion engine that runs on plant oil, to produce harvesting and planting machines, to the betterment of everyone so they can work less. They could use water and windmills to power semi mechanical/semi industrial plants that produce conserves for long term storage of foods and beverages, or weaving machines for fabrics. 
Wind could also produce a small amount of electricity, some batteries (albeit less effective) can be made with sodium, instead of lithium.


If the base incentive is to not harm nature, the pressure to invent totally different stuff is really high, if it's no growth and circular, the pressure on society to slave away you time and life to make a few rich is non existent.


Could we even detect them?


I just tried to say, assuming potential aliens are "just like us"  might be a major disadvantage of our thinking, just like people cannot a world without capitalism,  ignoring that a lot of major inventions in the past havn',t been made for money, but because of curiosity and the will to make life easier for everyone.
The only solution is communism, says communist.
Ted Kaczynski vindicated once again. If only he had lived to observe these awful truths
I would have assumed AI was ending civilizations.
>This would be true even if the civilization used renewable energy sources, due to inevitable leakage in the form of heat, as predicted by the laws of thermodynamics. 

AKA the LtG. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_pollution - the one thing you can't fix by indirectly producing more thermal pollution. 

>However, there are other options, for both humans and alien civilizations. Instead of accepting extinction or developing the technology to move energy production off-world, a civilization could choose to flatline their growth, Lingam suggested.

Not a capitalist civilization, but yes. 

Going to read the paper... let's see.
We will be fine, we will blot out the sun with LEO internet satellites!
So, there was life on Venus?
Most of the heat generated on earth's surface is from blackbody radiation from light from the sun. Most of that escapes into space. Mechanical waste heat is a drip in the bucket compared to that. This article seems dumb
What if we built like a giant heatsink? Like a space elevator, but the only thing going into space was excess heat? Or is that too non-credible?
This is what I said when I learned about the Fermi paradox. Climate change is the great filter because every civilization will have to milk its natural resources
Why dont we just pump the co2 we create from the energy we use into space
I often imagine a world of humans without the discovery oil. Maybe we would have found some other cleaner source of energy. Who knows, but I do know the use of oil and its byproducts is dooming life on our planet.
Aliens we've never heard of can't do it, so let's just give up too, huh?
Ah yes, the Fermi paradox.
But, but the bible says be fruitful and multiply!!!
In order to overcome this we would need a way to reject the heat energy into space.  We'd have to harness thermal energy to make light and basically just shine lasers out into space or something, since there's no atmosphere out there to conduct heat away.  Or like pour heat energy into some sort of phase change material (PCM) and send that molten material off into space with mass acceleration.
Aliens cars and pollution gotta go hard tho
Sure… stay scared folks
The greatest thing we can do to reduce suffering for everyone is self realize.
What if you can just leave and go to another planet?
Bogus article... blaw blaw ya aliens would probably face the same issues as us... Is the theory... Just so naive.
Thomas Malthus contributed to this study, I see
The article is itself as flawed. Where they state that there is no perfect energy system XXX and energy created must escape the system, is based on our understanding of renewable energy.

There is no proof, that our understanding of renewable energy is the only available option. so in theory, if that alien civilization were us, then yes. 

However, mathematically, it’s very doubtful that two civilization millions of light years apart, come to the same conclusion for renewable energy. 

They may have figured out a form of energy that doesn’t have to escape the system.
Just no you are assuming way too much you are assuming aliens have the same goals and concerns as humans not to mention their own planet with its own unique eco system 

I am more likely to believe that humans are the only life in the universe rather than just assuming aliens are anything like humans
Isn’t that conclusion the same thing that Uncle Ted was pushing for?

I guess with that high an IQ, you just figure it out decades before everyone else.
This is technically possible but objectively speaking there is zero evidence of aliens even existing, let alone what they're doing. I wouldn't stress about this too much.
but not us tho! ..... right?
I wrote a really long comment on this sub saying precisely this, a few months ago. Like identically. Down to the details.


Did some lurking shit heel steal my ideas and get published? Like seriously, the synopsis is almost word for word. 😂
Have you heard of the Kardashev scale? It's a system of measuring a civilization's technological advancement based on their energy production. Now, Nikolai Kardashev was a Russian astrophysicist, and his scale of measure was based ***entirely*** on exponential growth. According to Kardashev's scale,

* A type 1 civilization would have access to all the available energy on the planet and store it for consumption, and have total control of natural events such as volcanoes and earthquakes. 

* A type 2 civilization would could harvest all the energy produced by their star such as with a Dyson sphere. 

* A type 3 civilization would be able to harness all the energy in an entire galaxy, and every object within it, including all the stars and black holes. 

Human civilization, such that it is, doesn't even come close to a type 1 civilization. We're still burning biological material for energy. Our rudimentary space travel still relies on chemical reactants. 

Any civilization advanced enough to reach our planet in a reasonable travel time would, by definition be capable of superluminal flight. Faster than light. And in order to do that, they would have to have an understanding of material science that we can only dream of. 

It would stand to reason, then, that a civilization advanced enough to reach us would have a much more sophisticated method of energy production, one that doesn't rely on burning biological material to produce heat.
Maybe one of the alien civilizations are smart enough not to have this endless growth mindset
If it makes you feel better, sure you can tell yourself that
