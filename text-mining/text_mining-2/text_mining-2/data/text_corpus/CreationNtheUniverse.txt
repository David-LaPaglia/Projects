Don‚Äôt buy Starbucks
The cunt is a figurehead in a coffee company. What could possibly be so important ? " oh no, we need an urgent face to face meeting to talk about coffee bean supplies" give me a break. He could sit on Microsoft teams on permanent away status and Starbucks would keep selling shit coffee
Big naturals , nice. I dont know what the video said sound was off.
Starbucks sources its coffee through nestle.  So not only are they demonstrating environmental disregard with this these employment terms, their main product offering is built on child labor.  Meanwhile the american consumer is bankrupting themselves to pay the absurd markup for this unconscionable product.
the big tittie woman is right   fuck mcdonalds
Rules and taxes are for the middle class peasants
I demand my plastic straws.
What is she doing with her voice? Does she have an accent? Is she trying to sound more sensuous? Just talk regular damnit.
What‚Äôs her @? Let‚Äôs get it over with boys ü´°??

Taylor Swift has met her match
Fuck this guy and fuck Starbucks.
This mega corporation is a farce. Ya know what‚Äôs good for the environment? Making your own fucking coffee and drinking it out of a mug.

Best coffee around is at the Mobil down the road. Locally owned, they make a lot of their income from the morning rush.
Ah yes an exceptional argument for return to office.. way to lead from the front. To think, people that live in the same time zone are actually complaining about having to commute back to the office..
r/upvotedbecauseboobs
Can I hear her soothingly smooth voice daily?
Boycott starbucks and teach em a lesson
Remember, only the poors need to give up basic stuff to save the planet
Wouldn‚Äôt it be so cool if every single consumer boycotted their overpriced products? (It sucks anyway)
Literally he would be out of a job within a week
Upvote because of the boobs
Don't buy star boobs
This is an absolute lie.  Wtf is wrong with people.  He had an in home office and his contract states he will wirk from home.  Dont we have enough real shit to cry about instead of making shit uo and looking like fucking buffoons
Boycott Starbucks
Everyone who goes to Starbucks fuels this shit
Do you think anyone will stop buying Starbucks?  Nope. All hypocrites.
Something something boobs or something. Pretty sure she said something. Boobs

I went there once. When I saw the price of anything, I walked away.
Lots of carbon dioxide Derp
I couldn‚Äôt care less if these rich celebs fly private jets.  Just as long as they shut their mouths about climate change bullshit
Yeah its just such a bad look when you play the climate friendly, employee friendly, and woke card. I mean you hire a white dude, let him work remote, fly him around on a private jet, pay him $100M a year and the company gains $20B in value the day you announce it! It‚Äôs a club, we know it. Just stop lying to me
What ever it is she is buying, I‚Äôm selling. 
You know what I mean.
Divest.
Oh‚Ä¶ and to compensate that Starbucks will start growing coffee on solar panels üòê
She's a cutie, and fuck Starbucks.
I‚Äôm gonna send this to people when they ask why I‚Äôm a socialist
Sounds good now when they want him, but the minute things go sideways and the results don‚Äôt meet expectations they will tell him he has to move or quit.
Soo anyone else have trouble believing this ceo goes to work everyday
The guillotine was invented to "deal" with these situations.
 Wtf is a Starbucks dupe
Old fashioned hippie Adorable!
I hope the private charter crew drinks Duncan
Yessssssssir
Equity awards is not a salary‚Ä¶ At least she mentioned that she was too stupid to understand what that means
Ya got love that half the comments are fuck Starbucks and the other is pointing out her two magnificent points. There is room for everyone here dammit.
Im too distracted by those milkers
I hear you but Newport Beach, CA is awesome!

Maybe Starbucks HQ could relocate to SoCal‚Ä¶dude did this before.
Stop buying their shitty overpriced coffee
Wow, I guess people really appreciate their Starbucks coffees if this kind of stuff is permissible. Forget the guy who makes electric cars, this guy has coffee, let‚Äôs love him.
And his drinks suck anyway. Overall sweet garbage with no soul.
Nobody should be shocked at this, when Starbucks first appeared, so many people were saying,‚ÄùI just want a plain cup of coffee for 89 cents, I‚Äôll NEVER pay that much for a coffee!‚Äù 
Now, I have to avoid several intersections because these same people are causing a bottleneck waiting to get into line for the drive through window. 
Starbucks, Walmart, Home Depot..etc, they were all once told that they would fail for their big box business model and now laugh all the way to the bank.
Know why he‚Äôs got that stupid salary? Because pretentious ass people who like swill keep paying stupid amounts for their shitty coffee. Fuck Starbucks, shit is nasty.
If you don't like the company, don't do business with them, oops, thinking like a boomer again.  No, Congress should make a special tax on people I don't approve of.
Why can‚Äôt he just do his job from home?
this lady has huge opinions
I like that she's got a couple big ideas.
I‚Äôm done with Starbucks even if i like their coffee more than most. Boycott Starbucks
The lesson here is to become a ceo so Pocahontas can make meaningless videos about you that you won‚Äôt even notice
I stopped drinking SB in the 90‚Äôs‚Ä¶..
Dutch Bros is way better coffee.
I love how they use kilometers to sound further even tho it‚Äôs in the US. I used to commute 15-30 min, he‚Äôll change his mind real fast.
Is this the guy who forced the company to sell Olive oil in the coffee because his olive mogul friend wanted a payday?
They literally guillotined people for less wasteful and harmful things. People don't realize how abhorrent and selfish this behavior is. This person should be ridiculed and removed from society. All of them should. Anyone that is stupid, ignorant, and selfish enough to behave like this is dysfunctional and should be removed from society.
Rich people: *exist*
Reddit: *angry NPC noises*
He‚Äôs too rich for laws and rules to apply, that‚Äôs the beauty of the western world
If this is her voice I don‚Äôt want to be working next to her
Taylor swift does that same thing. They gonna attack her as well?
I just made my daughter a copycat pumpkin spice latte this weekend. It was simple and delicious.
Her voice is wonderful.
What is it about money that turns people into dirtbags?
I mean that's like Fiji water being like OOOO our water is so good but then were greenwashing the company using eco credits.
Stop buying this garbage.
And they are putting smaller engine sizes and putting turbos in our cars to save fuel efficency, making our car less reliable.

I could drive my whole life and result in as much carbon in the air as this cunt does in 1 week.
Sorry I don't care how true anything is if it comes from someone on tik tok.
don‚Äôt forget, they‚Äôre pledged to keep the environment clean though! /s
Few actually care about the climate change stuff. It's just marketing for them. Same for most of the DEI stuff. He's good at turning around companies though. He'll probably be good for the company and stock price. They have too many locations. If they were smart they would diversify a bit and get into some better food and maybe some wine and beer sales that might bring more people in at night. The guy knows what he's doing from a  marketing standpoint. He turned chipotle into a beast and took over right after their issues with food safety that might have killed some brands.
Starbucks is awful. I bought some BS vanilla cr√®me cold brew the other day for $7. It tasted literally like stale coffee mixed with ice that‚Äôs been sitting in a plastic cooler too long. I had one sip and threw it out.
A private company can pay and waste money all they want. Move on activist‚Ä¶
It‚Äôs always these types who are at the forefront of climate activism. The same government that uses your tax dollars to bomb children in Yemen, destroy pipelines in Europe, and consistently fails to balance their check book, is now going to use tax dollars to change the global temperature, and they can‚Äôt tell us what X reduction in carbon output relates to Y in temp decrease. All the while, making everything more expensive. Thanks
Nice necklace.
Wow, what a douche. With all the controversy surrounding their brand right now, why on earth would you want this guy as the figurehead?
Show me your knockers!
Show us the tits !
what you got going on down there
Burn them all.
Instead of talking shit about it, stop going
When will these climate change believers wake up and realize it‚Äôs all a grift to separate the elite ruling class from the plebs?
Can't afford raises though.
The speaker could just fuel his jet with milk and solve the whole problem imo
I need extra milk in my coffee.
This is wrong the CEO will be commuting once a week from CA to Seattle.
Capitalism is awesome!!
Holy milkers
Starbucks presents itself as a forward leaning company yet somehow they are so tone deaf that they hire a CEO who admits will fly daily to his job? Corporate hypocrisy knows no boundaries and it‚Äôs not just Starbucks though they are particularly clueless. I imagine there was no one else as qualified within the country who would relocate? Pfft.
Can we replace CEOs with automation? It'd actually be the absolute most cost effective solution. Just get an ai generated picture of an asshole in a suit and use chat GPT to generate stupid business decisions
I only drink Black Rifle coffee, which is delicious, and they help vets with their profits. F Starbucks
