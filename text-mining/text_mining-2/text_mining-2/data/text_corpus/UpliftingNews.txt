I always thought that they should revive the civilian conservation corps, this is close. I like it.
When I was growing up in Vermont, there was a reservoir where we'd go swimming and stuff.  One day, an old guy came up to us while we were getting the grill going, and told us the story of how he was part of FDR's program to improve public works, and helped to build the dam that made that reservoir (thus eliminated damaging floods downstream.)  Said it was the thing he was most proud of in his life.
Any idea where one can apply? I didn't see anything about that in the article. I have some biology work and am currently in the IT sector. I'd love to work for climate change in a positive way instead of working for a random software company.
We're the Planeteers, you can be one too! ...
I’m too old to join…🙁
In WW2, we had a wartime economy entirely dedicated to stopping fascism.  People rationed and changed jobs and sacrificed.  We need the same dedicated to preventing environmental collapse of our oceans.  Plastic , climate change, biodiversity loss, and land use are all taking their toll.  We need an army to build out grid storage and incorporate renewables to the grid.  Push your reps on this issue.  It will the defining battle of this century.  We preserve nature if we’re willing to fight and sacrifice and work together.
This sounds like an expansion to the Americorps program, which you can sign up for here. http://americorps.gov/join
Thats actually a somewhat good idea in broad theory. With working precedence.

Hopefully it doesnt get nickle and dimed to death in Congress.
30 seems a bit young for the cap. I imagine lots of this work could be done by healthy people into their 40s at least
WPA helped a lot of people in my city  I hope we see some placards claiming how this helped some buildings in our future.
I am an engineer I would love to volunteer to be part of this.
Could have called it "climate force", to appeal the kind of demographics who coincidentally don't really cares about climate.
Like the CCC :)
Not going to lie, I was sick to my stomach voting for him in the general and he was my absolute last pick in the primaries - but he's doing a hell of a job.
We need more of this. Jobs shouldn't be just for young people. Lots of older people care about climate change and could use a job.

There's TONS of work to do. 
1. Re-educated the public about green living and going low-carbon,

2. Get rid of invasive species-- especially things like kudzu and oriental bittersweet that choke out trees, 

3. Paint bike lanes,

4. Dismantle abandoned homes along waterfront areas-- rivers, lakes, oceans, 

5. Convert volunteer communities to no-lawn native plant areas, 

6. Staff ReUse Malls: vacant malls where donated items are refurbished and sold at affordable prices, 

7. Convert unused train lines to bike paths, 

8. Paint murals and create ads to promote low-carbon living-- [the climate war campaign is just like the homefront campaign in WWII](https://imgur.com/gallery/DVEMJci)

etc, etc, etc, etc.
Yes!!!!
Just signed up, it's never too late and every but will help
I hope they recruit overwhelmingly from red states. Then, when the fuckwits inevitably try to do away with this program, those who are benefitting from the program will see what's going on.
I like the whole young peoples thing, but I also think it would be a good idea to target people in the fossil fuel industry with a retraining program. It could get people who are scared of losing their jobs to support the energy transition.
I wonder how republicans will make this into a bad thing.
Dark Brandon strikes again
Well, at least it's a start in the right direction.
You know what, if his admin can pull this off and it starts a new generation of government sponsored civilian construction on infrastructure and energy production, he's got my vote.

Wow, amazing news. I hope some struggling young folk can nab that paid training and good jobs!
I'll sign up lol
I've been waiting for this for 20 years. Amazing

Seems a bit like polishing the brass on the titanic if we continue to increase the dozens of gigatons of carbon we pump into the atmosphere every year.
Did he unveil it while looking like a Top Gun senior instructor like in the picture ?
Love to sign up because I’m unemployed and burned out and my “career” is nonexistent but at 35 I’m too old! Guess I’ll die
We have to do something, collectively. Hopefully this is a good start. We are all in this shit storm together!
My primary criticism of this maneuver is that it was not done as an excuse to start a new branch of the military. First, channeling the military to positive projects would be a good use of defense funds. Second, it seems much more difficult to cancel a branch of the military (e.g. Space Force) than it does to cancel a program like this.
I can’t join at 41 :( now I feel old as hell. I have a degree in renewable energy engineering from OIT too.
My Grandfather was born in 1919 and always praised the conservation corp. 

I like like this.
Definitely more valuable than the Space Force
Dark Brandon Presides 🤘😎🍦
THIS is how you do it. Good job Mr. President!
Looks at the ocean 


Too late 

We 

fucked 

The only thing saving this planet in the long term is a mass extinction lol
Unless the job description includes dismantling the fossil fuel industry, there's not much these jobs can do
I'm impressed.  Good on him.
Where do I sign up?
I want this to come alongside higher taxes on corporations, stricter regulations and penalties. Investing in sustainable resources.... mandatory recycling  etc., etc.
It will last a few seconds after a republican becomes president again.
What about like spending that on stuff to help the everyday citizen? Like maybe a “road corps” where special agents travel around on highways all day and if a highway is all fucked up they have the authority to fix it. 

Idk just a thought🤷‍♀️
"We are the Climate Corps! Let our powers combine!"

Dark Brandon coming in to help the environment.
He should start by looking at Germany's recycling program. Also compare other countries with lower carbon footprints despite large factories and/or urban population.
This is the campaign promise I was most excited about.  Bring back the CCC for modern America.
What a cool way to feel like you are helping.
Interested in supporting or joining?  Go here: https://www.whitehouse.gov/climatecorps/
This is a very smart thing to do. Hopefully it's not just window dressing.
Its really been overdue that the government does a big national jobs project.  First he did infrastructure, now climate change.  That's my president!
Bring back the WPA!
Can felons sign up?
Give the permaculture grads/community land to work on. Hopefully it's something like this that also produces food for people.
convert the military to earth repair
If they don't call them Planeteers and Don Chedle isn't doing promotion work for recruiting, what are they doing?
It's about time. We've wasted decades of job creation and environmental responsibility compromising with the right and their choke hold on coal and oil's balls.
I mean based I guess. Biden ain’t half bad. He can cool it on the ATF/IRS agents though…
Ooooh I'm into this. I need a new job and I would love to help the environment.
Do they need any devs?
Not to poo-poo this, but the original Civilian Conservation Corps put [millions to work](https://www.history.com/topics/great-depression/civilian-conservation-corps) while this is for 20k jobs. Maybe we don't need millions of jobs given the tight labor market, but given the large scope and scale of the climate crisis it likely warrants more than 20k people, but it's better than nothing, I suppose.
This is awesome news! Super excited to see what we build through this program!
Hell yeah. This is the kind of patriotism I can go for
Crushing it!
How is it different from the EPA? Is it more like people with boots on the ground doing conservation stuff or is it more regulations focused?
What are they going to do? Build wind farms?
Wonder if they will pay well and hire dispatchers…
Until republicans dismantle it because anything science related
Spurring the green economy in the US, to take on more of a leadership position and offset the destructive influence of inferior products manufactured with slave labor flooding the market, is a commendable goal.

But I hear "jobs program" in connection with the existential threat we face from climate change and my eye twitches involuntarily. Let's not repeat some of the environmentally counterproductive programs that soldiered on purely because they created employment.

Such as:

Municipal recycling programs that focused on the wrong materials, that commingled materials to the extent they all went to the dump anyway, that employed industrial chemicals and processes that did more harm than could ever be offset by reusing recovered raw materials, and that ultimately served the interests of the single-use paper goods and plastics industries by green-washing wastefulness with highly-suspect labeling of these products as recyclable.

Obsessive construction of dams, with over 91,000 of them in the US. To create jobs both directly, as massive civil engineering projects, and indirectly by supplying cheap power billed as being an environmental freebie, and turning desert into farmland at huge cost to the flows of these waterways. Don't worry, at the current pace of removal, it should only take about 1,400 years to tear them down and restore the natural flows and wildlife of our rivers.
They can use the space force offices.
Just bring back the CCC. It could help so many people
Total miss on not calling it the Planeteers.
Great first step, hopefully some meaningful legislation is to follow. 

The easiest route would be to bankroll a ton of nuclear plants, I'd be happy to pay extra taxes to avoid a disaster
Climate Corps > Space Force
Here we go. Now we're cooking with ~~gas~~ solar
No chance people will listen to this corps and make lasting change when they haven't been listening to actual scientists since the 90's
Go climate corps!

![gif](giphy|0Av9l0VIc01y1isrDw)
Can they be classified as military and siphon some of that bloated budget? Too much goes unaccounted for as well
Fucking yes: pending details
Hopefully they have more pull than the EPA
Interesting to see how funding works, where the jobs are located and what the pay will be for those jobs.
Generation Z will ensure this change stays.
Yeah and it probably takes advantage of newly graduated college students and pays them jack shit just like AmeriCorps
That makes a lot more sense than the 'Space Corps.'
Im one year too old for this .-.   I wanted to sign up.  Do they make exceptions?
Could be a decent metal band name. 
It would sit in a genre called ErthCore.
Shouldn't be a program. Dude needs to be opening a whole damn agency
The comparisons to the New Deal CCC sound great but what exactly is this program going to do?  The article doesn't mention any impactful definitive jobs.  The fact that it only employees 20,000 people its first year and "most positions will not require previous experience" makes this sound like a feel-good program.
CLIMATE ARMY!
How do I sign up?
Sign me up!
😂😂😂😂😂
It would be absolutely amazing to allow kids to take this as an alternative to military service and get some kind of compensation for college
Sign up
This is how you spur the economy correctly
So glad to see the ball rolling with the infrastructure act, IRA, and now this.  Huge investment everywhere.  Tesla and Chinese OEMs moving fast to jolt the auto industry into action.  All this stuff is really doing a lot for my long standing climate depression and resulting antipathy for modern life.  I will proudly be casting my ballot for Joe Biden a second time.
