Air pollution clouds the mind and makes everyday tasks challenging

People's ability to interpret emotions or focus on performing a task is reduced by short-term exposure to particulate matter (PM) air pollution, potentially making everyday activities, such as the weekly supermarket shop, more challenging.

Air pollution inequities linked to industrial swine facilities are detectable from space

A UVA study uses satellite data to show that air pollution from industrial swine farms in Eastern North Carolina disproportionately affects marginalized communities.

A groundbreaking study led by University of Virginia researchers has used satellite measurements to show the long-term persistence of air pollution inequalities tied to industrialized swine facilitie… [+3192 chars]

Clean air policies having unintended impact driving up wetland methane emissions by up to 34 million tons

Reducing sulphur in the air may inadvertently increase natural emissions of methane from wetlands such as peatlands and swamps, a new study has found. The resulting additional future release of 20-34 million tons of methane each year from natural wetlands wou…

Technology for oxidizing atmospheric methane won't help the climate

Atmospheric scientists show proposed 'geoengineering' effort to remove methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from the atmosphere could worse air quality while providing minimal climate benefits.

As the atmosphere continues to fill with greenhouse gases from human activities, many proposals have surfaced to "geoengineer" climate-saving solutions, that is, alter the atmosphere at a global scal… [+6470 chars]

New weapon against harmful algal blooms

Effective management of phosphorus is needed to curb the rise of harmful algal blooms. Few studies have explored how algal biomass, especially blue-green algae, can be used to create materials that remove phosphate from water. Researchers have filled that gap…

As harmful algal blooms (HABs) continue to spread across the globe, urgent research is needed to address this growing threat. Studies in Italy, China, and the Atlantic basin have shown that many wate… [+5641 chars]

We have underrated the climate effects of new particles in urban areas

A recent study has uncovered compelling evidence suggesting that the climate effects of new particles in urban areas have been significantly underestimated.

Particles play a crucial role in climate regulation, influencing processes such as cloud formation and radiation balance. Traditionally, research in urban environments has focused largely on primary … [+3361 chars]

Engineers model electric grid demand for EVs to charge while in motion

Running out of gas in a remote area far from a gas station is every driver's worst nightmare. A similar stressor, known as "range anxiety," exists for owners of electric vehicles who worry about how far their EV's can drive without running out of battery. As …
