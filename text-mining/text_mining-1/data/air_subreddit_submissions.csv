LA air & tomorrow’s rain,"Obviously the fires have been horrible, and this extended touch-and-go time after the initial disaster feels neverending and directionless.  No guidance on how toxic the air is, no way to know.  

I’ve been masking outside, purifying air in 3 rooms, sealing up my ancient apartment windows, opening them desperately to try to let out the mass buildup of CO2 in my apartment, and now many days I’m getting a white dust on my windowsill that I’m learning/assuming is ash from the fires.  

I’m beyond grateful that my home is okay, volunteering where I can.  But it’s exhausting to maintain this much control over the air in an apartment.  I’m not sure about y’all, but I would love the opportunity to breathe a full lungful of air without worrying.

Do we know if tomorrow’s rains will create any new acid rain conditions, any new problems (barring possible mudslides)?  Or do we think they may finally bury some of the harsher chemicals into the ground and let everybody breathe for a day or two?

Hope you’re all staying safe.  ",13,2025-01-25 23:52:33

Poor CO2 Levels,"I live in 1920s apartment building in LA.  A little run down, no AC or ventilation whatsoever.  I’ve become very into AQI after the recent wildfires and, due to needing to seal up our windows to protect against ash/pollution, I got curious about my CO2 levels.  Bought a meter.

I can get down to 400ppm at BEST, with the main windows left open for 4+ hours.  More often than not, we hover around 800ppm, rising to mid-900s if we (2 partners) spend even 30 minutes lying in bed watching videos.  Random spikes to 1300+ out of nowhere.  ~ 1000 normal mornings.  Who knows what it’s been up until this point.  During the worst of the wildfires we went maybe 7+ days without airing a window.

I feel like my eyes have been opened.  I’m using fans, air purifiers (again, because of the fires), doors all open, and opening the windows when I can, but obviously this problem existed before I was aware of it.  I’ve had chronic headaches and dizzy spells for months!  I sleep like crap, never a full night.

Maybe the taped windows aren’t helping, but we have plenty of exposed brick walls for leakage.

How can I stay on top of this given that I can’t move, I have zero expendable income, I can’t structurally change my apartment, and my partner seems completely unaffected by the stuffy air?",4,2025-01-24 16:40:23
Professional opinion on my amateur VOC post-Eaton-fire remediation plan?,"TLDR: We're renting near Altadena and our house got a lot of smoke (and some ash) exposure. The ash is gone but the VOC's remain. I'm wondering if I can adequately clean this up myself. I appreciate any professional advice and tips.

Backstory: My wife and I live about 0.5 miles from the burn zone in Altadena, and we're trying to determine the safety of our home and local environment. My wife is pregnant, and when I spent a night back at home I woke up with a headache and nausea that would last the next day.

Since then we've been cleaning according to FEMA and local guidelines, wearing proper PPE (P100 mask, gloves). But I don't know which VOCs are in the house and how their levels have changed over time. I'm currently monitoring levels in the house with a Qingping V2 and PM2.5 levels are essentially zeroed but VOC's are in the 50's.

Once I've completed the following, I plan to order a VOC Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Test Kit to check my work. 

So far:

1. Wet wipe all ash, toss the rags. Second wipe with D-Lead soap.

2. Removed all launderable items, and washed them on a heavy cycle + extra rinse with D-Lead detergent (and potentially baking soda if they still smelled). Dry Cleaned all of the nicer stuff. Keeping everything that's been cleaned out of the dirty house.

3. Running 4 air purifiers.

4. Washed the outside of the house (especially windows and screens), and opened windows once the air outside was safe. Bought a bunch of air quality plants and put out pans of activated carbon.

5. Hired a cleaner to wipe down every single surface with surface cleaner, tossing all of the rags.

6. Hired professional upholstery cleaners for the couch, rugs, and mattress.

Next:

7. Throw out the mattress and bed pillows anyway. 

8. Wipe every surface down AGAIN with diluted Krud Kutter (Chat GPT said it's good for smoke gunk).

9. Wipe down eating surfaces with D-Lead wipes.

10. Run VOC test to see what's still in the air.

Qingping Air Monitor - Apple Watch / iOS Widgets!,"[AirMonitor Watch iOS](https://preview.redd.it/uybbhfkjxqee1.png?width=1370&format=png&auto=webp&s=03f49837359b03364f01aed62376ae3eba21bd01)

Hey everyone!

Over the holidays I was gifted a QingPing Air Monitor Lite and loved all the data it pulls from my environment, but I was a little disappointed with the app. Even with Homekit enabled the UI wasn't really working for me and I really wanted to be able to see the info on my Apple Watch and iPhone Lockscreen.

So I took a look at the API that's available and built my own app which has just been approved by Apple in the AppStore.

I reached out to u/bucketofrubble (admin) to double check it was okay to share!

Thankfully they encouraged me to share with the community as there maybe someone else just like me out there who's looking for the same solution!

You can check the App out on the store [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/air-quality-watch/id6740650396](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/air-quality-watch/id6740650396) if it's of interest - the app will guide you on what's required (you'll need to generate your own API key to access your devices and my app has no access to any of your devices nor does it record any data)

It displays all the same values you'd expect and pushes those to the Watch and Lock / Homescreens, as the data comes direct from QingPing's servers, it's only every 15 mins, in the future I'll look at doing it direct from the device for more real time values (Apple are quite restrictive over widget refresh times so there's a limit to how fast it can be)

I'm sure it won't be perfect for everyone's use case, so please if you've any feedback or suggestions (hopefully no bugs!) please reach out and I'll do what I can to quickly ship updates.

If there's enough interest, I'll finish off the Apple TV App!

Chronic illnesses - air quality checking options?,"Hi, 

I have been diagnosed with chronic fatigue (CFS) and long COVID I am still going through different test for the symptoms in long COVID, as well as these I have an array of other conditions. One of the things I have associated with Long Covid is air hunger, which they have said is dysfunctional breathing syndrome...... my Airways are clear, and no one is sure why this is happening. 

I've just spent a week away from home, and although knowing symptoms are better out of the house anyway, I'm really starting to think is it the house? I thought it might be a psychological reasoning, and maybe the physical symptoms are a result of my mental conditions, but now I'm starting to wonder. 

I have started looking into air quality testers or looking at someone to come in and check the house for me. I really don't know what I should be going for or what even are the things I want to check and which device would be best suitable. Being in an older house, I do know we get mould around windows etc which I always clean away, but I wonder if there is mould I can't see, etc. I have read air quality monitors don't ""detect mould"" but air quality is a good indication, I don't know what I'm looking for, please help! 

Another thing to note is I'm not flush with cash, but at the same time don't want to make an expensive mistake and go for the wrong thing!

In LA - advice needed for more pure indoor air,"Please be gentle as this is probably a dumb question. Speak to me like a small child. For those of us in LA currently living with our windows sealed tight for weeks now, is it better to continue to keep them closed (knowing outside air is filled with VOCs and particles) OR at some point open the windows for a short time and purify air with purifiers on high blast? 

my Aranet4 monitor is consistently reading over 1500 when its usually around 700-800 (or less after opening windows for an hour or so.) Obviously this isn’t healthy either but at least I know for sure none of the smoke filled/ash filled air is inside at the moment..

Haven’t left home in days as eyes are super sensitive to the smoke after being outside for just a few mins (which is why opening windows and letting that in is also terrifying). But can’t live like this forever. 

Thanks in advance for your guidance because I don’t see a solution😭.

"AirThings View Plus, VOC levels, and OCD","Hi everyone! So, I suffer from OCD that often relates to feelings of responsibility--to avoid harm to others, being the only one who will be able to identify and solve a sneaking problem, etc. It's no surprise that this often settles on environmental issues. I don't imagine I'm the only OCD sufferer in this forum. But please keep that in mind if/when you respond here.

I got an AirThings View Plus to monitor air quality in my 5 year old son's bedroom. The main reason is that we live in a Brooklyn apartment on the ground floor. Directly below us is the basement, of course. The boiler room, with natural gas furnace, is directly below his bedroom.

The furnace and everything has been inspected last year, and I also told the landlord I smelled something suspicious (not true) at which point he sent a boiler tech to check for leaks 2 weeks ago. All clear & in good working order.

I stopped checking the AirThings obsessively for a few weeks but then logged back in to find that my VOC levels had jumped fairly significantly. Here's the chart of the ranges from 12/29/2024 through 1/20/2025:

[https://imgur.com/a/FTeiKem](https://imgur.com/a/FTeiKem)

No ""event"" that I can think of happened around this time or this particular span of days toward the end.

Is this something that AirThings View Plus is just known for? My monthly ppb average is 390. I'd rather it be better, but worrying about general air quality is one thing, worrying about dangerous fumes from a furnace is another.

All other metrics on the AirThings are in the green. I also bought a low level CO monitor that would register anything even above 10ppm, I've never seen it registering anything other than a flat 000.

Due to these readings my OCD is screaming for me to get more testing done, more diagnostics, etc to figure out the potential issue. I have a strong feeling that this might just downward spiral into more anxiety.

The testing company person I spoke to (who obviously is incentivized to...do testing) said that the spikes I'm seeing wouldn't come from things like household cleaning products, children's toys (kid's room is obviously full of plastic junk and stuffed animals, etc). Wdyt??

I'm also confused by the fact that these readings were looking pretty darn decent for a long stretch of time before spiking up. Obviously the furnace has been on since the data started tracking in late December. So I'm wondering if it could be a calibration issue--I periodically do open the window for stretches of time to introduce fresh air.

I'd welcome any insights here, especially from someone who also has an Airthings, and ESPECIALLY from anyone with professional background/credentials. My OCD loves to doubt the provenance of advice, unfortunately, though I try to push back on that.

Thanks in advance!! Also feel free to DM me, I realize this is a pretty niche question.",3,2025-01-21 20:48:27

When the outside air is toxic: forced ventilation with HEPA/carbon filtration,"https://preview.redd.it/10svzowzv6ee1.png?width=1217&format=png&auto=webp&s=b832a58ac15169c8403cfc5cf0e244323319fb25

TLDR: Just wanted to share what a difference forced ventialtion with HEPA/carbon filtration makes in terms of particle counts indoors vs outdoors. It's a 10-20-fold reduction across the spectrum of particle counts, as long as one maintains positive pressure indoors and air changes per hr at 0.5.

My situation is not as dire as with LA fires, but I have to deal with wood smoke every winter, I've posted here on this every now and then. I live  It's a ""civilized"" neighborhood with gas/electricity, but some people still choose to burn wood. Last winter I had bad asthma b.c. of this and had to take a heavy-duty medication to be able to breathe and speep. This winter I implemented forced ventilation with HEPA and carbon filtration at 0.5 air changes per hour, and life got much easier. No more wood smoke smell inside, no more constant asthma attacks, and plenty of fresh air (CO2 does not go above 800-1000 ppm). I haven't opened my windows to vent over the last 2 months -- all fresh air goes through the filters. I replaced the pre-filter (3M MERV1500) after 2 months of operation -- it was black from the soot. Never seen ""poor air quality"" alerts from our local govt station, it's all good according to them.

I also note that I also have two recirculating (""traditional geometry"") HEPAs running inside 24/7/365at about 500  m\^3 per hr (\~300 cfm). This is in a 1000 sq ft apt. Before I implemented the forced ventilation, the best reduction in particle counts with respect to the outside I could achieve was 2-fold. This is consistent with published peer-reviewed research, e.g.https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12532754/

*To obtain substantial, e.g. 50%, reductions in indoor concentrations of these allergens, the rate of airflow through the filter must be at least a few indoor volumes per hour. To obtain a concentration reduction on the order of 75%, the rate of airflow through the filter must be approximately 10 indoor volumes per hour, which may be impractical except within individual rooms.*",4,2025-01-20 17:24:58
LA Fires / Post-Wildfire Questions,"Hi everyone. Figured you're the experts to ask. Background: I'm in a standing home less than 500 ft from a burn area. Our community has been really fortunate with generous donations of clothing, water, and other immediate necessities, but for those of us whose homes are still standing, and may contain VOC and chemical containing soot/char things are complicated in terms of figuring out steps to remediate/clean our homes, and keep the air healthy, and even other wildfire survivors don't seem to have great answers. I'm in an older home and will not be entirely sure how breached it was until soot testing is completed and I can start to clean up.

In the meantime, I've been looking into the different air monitoring and filtering options, since estimates are that it might be as much as 2 years before the air in our area is back to normal. I was considering going with a more robust sensor, like an Air Gradiant One (and maybe the outdoor one as well) in the living room which is the largest room and adjacent to everything else, and then getting 2-3 like the Ikea sensors for the other rooms.

I was also considering 2-3 Coway HEPA Air Purifiers, though I don't see a charcoal option, and once ducts are cleaned installing the MERV 12 filters.

Am I forgetting anything? Any alternatives you'd suggest? Is this overkill?

"PSA: The LA fires are filling the air with TOXIC smoke and particles. If you can leave, do it! ","After 9/11, nearly 400k people were exposed to harmful air from the destruction of the towers; 130k are still being monitored for health complications as a result.  
Now, in LA, more than 12,000 homes, businesses and other structures have burned.

Folks, the long term health consequences of hanging around are no joke. We are seeing a lot of people talking about air purifiers and stuff, which may help mitigate a bit of pollution, but the volume of CO, VOCs and particulate matter that have come from this is something that you should actively try to avoid. Not to mention, unless you have an activated charcoal filter, you aren't filtering any of the VOCs.

If you can leave, do it. If you can't, consider implementing these steps to reduce exposure:

Pick one room in your house or apartment and make it a clean room. Seal the vents, window seams, door jams. Filter the air coming in with a purifier + charcoal filter and force vent the air outside. This can help minimize your exposure. To further illustrate what this might look like: 

1. A box fan in the window blowing air from inside to outside, sealed all the way around so the only way for air to go is through the fan.

2. Air purifier in the doorway (or second window) with again, everything sealed except for air intake for the purifier.

3. Seal up the vent if you have central AC or window AC.

Other consideration:

1. CFM (Cubic Feet per Minute) intake vs venting. Try to balance these. Might require 2 intake purifiers to match the venting CFM.

Stay safe everyone.

I grew up in NY so I know of a few people who got lung cancer (people who weren’t even first responders). Anyway thinking back to this is weighing heavy on my mind at the moment. I’m wondering if I should take my kids and get out of here for a few weeks. 
Any air quality experts on here or anyone with some extra knowledge on the topic that may be able to provide some input on if it would be wise to get out of town for a couple of weeks?",10,2025-01-14 04:13:24
air quality in downtown l.a. actually clean?,"# the air quality maps (i look at IQ air and purple air) seem to show clean air (green across the map) in downtown los angeles, both yesterday and today. is this for real? it seems too soon after the fires, and too close to active fires, for the air to actually be this clear. do these sensors pick up all the smut and burnt plastic from wildfires? can anyone who understands this stuff explain? i want to go outside without a mask, but am a little wary.

Air Quality after LA fires,"Very lucky and grateful that I didn’t lose my home, now just fishing for how to stay sane while the fires continue and smoke becomes part of our lives for the next few weeks.

I’m getting headaches, burning eyes, and fatigue every day, masking with N95s outside.  Crazy from the lack of fresh air.  Chemical-y feeling in my lungs like a hair salon.  

AQI reading is “good” right now near me (anywhere from 17-60 today), but with all the chemicals used in the old homes that burned down, there’s just no way to trust the meters because a lot of them can’t read for asbestos or formaldehyde, and I can definitely FEEL the difference in the air, it’s a spooky feeling.

I’ve taped all the windows in my old apartment (no AC), 1 very strong air purifier running and two more in the mail on the way.  

Just had to use some liquid plumber in our sink and the chemical smell is a knockout with no ventilation.

Seeking Advice on Air Quality and Health Risks After the Eaton Fire,"I live about 2.5 miles from the Eaton fire, with the closest burned house just 1 mile away, and I’m struggling to decide whether it’s safer to stay indoors or temporarily relocate. While I’ve sealed windows, taped vents, and run four HEPA air purifiers, including a medical-grade one, I’m still concerned about the hazardous materials released from the fire. Many of the burned houses likely contained asbestos, lead paint, and VOCs, and I’m also worried about plastics, synthetic chemicals, paint, batteries, and cleaning materials from the nearby hardware stores, both of which are about 1.5 miles away from me.

The other morning, I had a terrible headache and was in bed until the afternoon because of it. Thankfully, I’m feeling normal now, and everyone in the house is feeling fine, but despite this, I’m concerned about potential long-term health effects from exposure, especially the fine PM2.5 particles. I’m also concerned about burnt asbestos fibers from the older houses that burnt. With the high gusty winds that night, it’s possible that fibers from the fire could have been carried farther and even reached our area. I’ve been reading about the risks of chronic conditions like asthma, bronchitis, reduced lung function, cardiovascular issues, and even lung cancer. These aren’t things we might experience today, tomorrow, or even next week, but they could manifest years down the road, particularly for the 2 young kids that we have.

We are limiting our outdoor exposure as much as possible. We’re keeping all windows and doors closed and trying to stay indoors all day. If we do need to go outside, we wear KN95 masks to protect ourselves from particulates. While we don’t wear KN95 masks inside, we can if necessary—it would be challenging but remains an option.

Adding to this, many people in my neighborhood are using leaf blowers, unknowingly spreading ash and dust into the air, and we’re expecting high winds again in the coming days, which could worsen conditions.

I know relocating is always the safer thing to say and the easier advice to give, and I know we can look into temporary housing benefits, but after everything we’ve gone through in the past few days, honestly, I just want to get a good night’s sleep and mentally recover from the stress of evacuating our house. It would be so helpful to have an assessment of the actual risks we’re facing so we can weigh how much risk we’re taking by staying versus relocating. This would help us make a more informed decision about whether relocating is truly worth the inconvenience, cost, and disruption to our recovery.

I also check apps like PurpleAir and IQAir to monitor PM2.5 levels, but they only measure outdoor air quality and don’t account for the indoor air inside my house, which can vary. Buying a monitor to measure indoor air is an option, but at around $200, it’s a significant expense to consider. 

How concerned should we be about long-term risks from materials like asbestos, lead, VOCs, plastics, and cleaning chemicals? I’d also appreciate any insight on how long it might take for air quality to normalize?

Thanks in advance for any advice or shared experiences. I’m trying to make the most informed decision for my family and would love to hear your input.",6,2025-01-12 01:27:31
Trying to make sense of readings (in southern California) ,"I live in Pasadena 1.8 mile south of the start of the Eaton fire. Probably a mile or less from where things actually burned.

Disappointed with the AirGradient One PM2.5 issue,"A few days ago I received my AG One kit and put it together and added it to HomeAssistant. Most of the values are great but the PM values were basically always zero which I found odd especially as it did not match my current sensor. After doing some searching I found [this page](https://www.airgradient.com/documentation/calibrate-low-pms-sensors/) explaining that there is an issue with the PM sensor but the only corrections are available on the dashboard which doesn't help for my HA use case.

What's upsetting is that it seems like there have been similar issues since [February of 2024](https://forum.airgradient.com/t/new-device-does-not-show-pm2-5-readings-i-always-get-a/1757) or at least since [September of 2024](https://www.airgradient.com/blog/low-readings-from-pms5003/) if this is somehow unrelated to the earlier problem (which seems unlikely given the date codes on the affected modules).

So why is AG still selling these units if they are not functioning correctly? Heck even their own blog post above calls these ""faulty modules"". At the very least this issue should be disclosed on the purchase page so folks are aware that they might receive a monitor that doesn't currently work correctly.

I bought the AG One specifically to monitor CO2 and PM2.5 and instead I have an expensive air quality monitor that only does half of what I bought it to do. Worse yet, I have no idea if the issue has been resolved since Achim said they were finalizing new firmware back in November but I haven't seen an update confirming that the issue has been fixed and I'm still seeing nonsense values running firmware 3.1.13.",4,2025-01-09 19:09:17

Ozone generator safety,"I have a downstairs neighbor that smokes cigarettes frequently and in the 5 years I have owned my condo, I very rarely use my patio because she smokes outside and it comes right up onto my porch.

This time of year, I like to open my sliding glass doors, but I end up having to immediately run to shut them because I swear my home just sucks in the smoke.  I guess because I quit smoking 20 years ago, I'm sensitive to it.  I simply can't stand it.

A friend bought me an ozone generator (small 15000 mgh/h) so that I could put it on my patio and see if it would enable me to open my doors.  I really didn't think it would work, tbh, because smoke rises and this little thing is sitting on a table dirctly in front of the door,, but I figured that I would try.

I didn't realize how dangerous the gas is, though.  So, this is my question.  I moved it as far as the cord would allow (maybe 2.5 feet) from my open sliding glass door and it is sitting on a table with a screened in patio.  Is this safe?

I could move it with an extension cord toward the screen, but is this futile?  Is this thing so small it wouldn't do what we were hoping anyway?

My neighbor has a right to enjoy her patio, it just sucks that it removes my ability to do so :(

For CO2 there is in similar price range that I am considering:

Ductless range hoods that just recirculate the smoke can be misleading to unsuspecting users. ,"Several years ago, when I started renting an apartment, I finally realized that the range hood simply sucks up the smoke, odors, gases and shoots it out the top front, back into the room. I wasn't very aware of air quality at the time, and it took me months to realize this. I spent all those months simply assuming that I didn't need to open the windows as much, so long as the fans were on. I turned those fans on every single time I cooked, while hot smoke just blew over my head, both literally and figuratively. Don't be fooled like I was.

So make sure your range hood is actually connected to duct work if you are not sure. If you don't see ducts, you might still have them but need to look for it. If you have cabinets above the range, you should see some square metalic looking ducts behind the doors. If the wall is an exterior wall, you can check if there is a vent on the opposite side.",18,2024-12-28 00:56:23

Wife suddenly became allergic to house ,"Around August my wife started having strong allergies in the house. Sneezing, runny nose, itchy puffy eyes, to the point where she would be unable to do any work. Whenever she goes into office or we go on vacation or elsewhere, allergies are gone. I've been looking at other similar posts on reddit, so trying to come up with a checklist of things to do:  
  
1) We already replaced the air filter on furnace. It was at FPR 5, i bought FPR 12 but made no difference

2) Check for dust mite allergens, then have wife test for dust mite allergy 

3) Hire someone to clean air ducts - I had tried shop vaccing (purchased from costco) all the air ducts but didn't seem to make any difference

4) Test for mold (should we buy a kit or hire professional?)

5) Have her see an allergy specialist (what tests should we get in addition to dust mite)?

6) Use air purifier - this did seem to help, but only in the room where the air purifier is located

Room Humidifier Recommendation,"Hi All,

VOC spike every morning with gas heat,"I came across an archived post on this subreddit today that helped me realize there was a problem and couldn't comment, so I thought I'd share my experience. I was seeing a spike in VOCs every morning that would taper back down throughout the day. It would usually get about as high as 2100 ppb, but would then gradually fall. It's cold out, but not freezing. However, we did have a cold snap with a freeze a few weeks ago.

It turns out our heat exchanger had a few holes in it, possibly made worse by the recent freeze. Most of the bad gasses were still escaping outside, and you could smell it near the unit when it was running, but apparently it was still allowing some VOCs into the house. We saw a spike in the morning because the heat would warm up the house in the morning, but never needed to run as long the rest of the day. The carbon monoxide detectors in the house were never triggered, but the VOC detection could have saved us from a much larger problem. We're getting a new unit on Monday.",6,2024-12-14 04:03:43

How to understand Sensirion TVOC level?,"My qingping2 is equipped with Sensirion sensor. By default it outputs TVOC index

Explanation by qingping 

>VOC index"" is a TVOC representation method proposed by Sensirion. The index takes the average concentration of TVOC detected by the sensor in the past 24 hours as 100 points and uses the 0~500 points to represent the relative concentration of TVOC in the current environment

AirGradient provides a good technical  explanation about the limitation of low cost sensor and why index is used:
 https://www.airgradient.com/blog/accuracy-sensirion-sgp41/

1. What specific class of  VOC does the  Sensirion TVOC index is meant for? Is it dangerous compound like formaldehyde, or does it also include harmless VOC like gas emitted by a certain ripe fruit?

2. It's been weeks and my TVOC index stays at around 50. How can I identify the source?

Seeking for suggestion - what could be the cause of shortage of breath,"We moved in a 1979 house and it was renovated 2 years ago. There are two stories, top floor is fine, sometimes CO2 and VOC readings are high after cooking but opening windows will help a lot. I barely have any suffocating feelings 

However, there’s one half basement floor, which I understand would have worse airflow naturally. The reading would be rather bad if I don’t open the window as shown in the picture

However, I never expected it to give me shortage of breath, watery and sleepy eyes, etc. I tried dealing with it for a couple months but it seems to be not effective:
1. Bought Airthing to monitor the VOC and CO2 level
2. Installed ERV, confirmed the reading are all in healthy ranges. But the suffocating feeling would come back
3. Tried opening window, reading will be normal, but the feeling is still there, maybe slightly better compared to opening ERV

There are also no visible molds, humidity has been low (around 45-50). My wife tried staying at the same place together but she’s feeling fine and she could even finish working out in the same floor, so it got me really confused why I am reacting so differently - especially I used to live in basement floor / places with worse airflow before and back then I was feeling fine.

Also the reading doesn’t make sense to me - as long as I step into the basement floor, VOC reading would go up like crazy (from 50 to 300+) but I thought human exhalation shouldn’t cause this much increase. My guess is somehow I aggregated some thing in the basement floor, but not exactly sure. 

Can anyone suggest what’s something I could try to do to make the situation improve? ",3,2024-12-09 06:11:00

Advice Much Appreciated - In house inspection phase and probably have 48 hours to back out,"Happy Friday all,

I stumbled on this sub and hoping you all may be able to advise me on my situation a bit. (I dont mean to be lazy but i have tried to research all day and am in a time crunch)  

We just had a contract accepted on dream house, we have been looking for 3+ years.  Kids are 5 and 7, in a top  district, whole 9 yards.  The lot is half acre, deep yard, lots of greenage.  That said the house is on one of the main roads in the city.

The road itself has about 20k/cars a day on average.  It does not get many big trucks, no tractor trailers (too narrow), the speed limit is only 30mph, and there is no stop signs/lights close that cars have to stop/accelerate.  So most coasting by 30-35mph.  The closest major interstate is over 2.5 miles away.

I know that is a good amount of cars, but given the other factors, I dont know if this would be considered critical from an air quality/risk standpoint, especially if i an mindful of it all (keep kids inside when its bad out, filters maintained, etc)?  It is just hard to find any relevant research because most of the studies I saw with negative results were 100k+/day with trucks, interstates, etc.

I guess the question is, what are peoples overall thought?  Would this be a show stopper for many of you?  Is there a test that I could do? Other filters/remedies this?  This is just exactly what we have been looking for for 3+ years, the price is great, and timing couldnt be better.

CO2 sensor shows lower equilibrium in colder weather,"Hi guys,

Bought a CO2 meter a week or two ago and have been paying attention at how high the CO2 gets without opening the windows because the street outside is noisy and I like to keep them closed. It's part of the reason I got a CO2 meter, so I know just how long I can keep them closed without harm.

And I noticed that the equilibrium I reach is lower when outside is colder. On a few of the days when it's cold outside and the windows are closed, I'd get about \~700 ppm, even if the windows are closed all day. But when it's a bit warmer, I need to open the windows every few hours if I want to stay under 1000-1100 ppm.

Now, I'm doubting whether my CO2 meter is even working properly. Is there something related to temperature that can explain this?

Why does my home HVAC increase indoor CO2?,"I rent half of a duplex and have been trying to figure out why I always feel tired and headachy at home. After a long period of experimentation, I’ve discovered that the HVAC system increases indoor CO2 levels. Anything above 750 seems to make me feel terrible (although I’m not totally sure whether the effect is from the CO2 itself or some other pollutant that my sensors can’t detect. There is no increase in particulates or VOCs.)

I ran a number of experiments (closing off one room of the house while opening the windows in the rest of the house), and found that even just running the HVAC fan would increase the indoor CO2 by 200-300ppm. Turning on the a/c compressor would increase the CO2 by another 300 or so. The same seems to happen when running the heat. 

However, the effect is not observed on every trial. Sometimes running the system causes a rapid and sustained rise in CO2, other times it releases a burst of CO2 that then levels out, sometimes it causes no effect. So I suspect some kind of exhaust may be getting sucked into the system at some point? Using our gas oven causes CO2 to go crazy, although the landlord assures me they had it inspected and it is properly vented. I know nothing about HVAC, so it’s tough to me to develop a hypothesis. The air outside tests normal, including in the area by the HVAC unit.

I was able to convince the neighbor to place an air quality monitor on the other side of the duplex, and they do not seem to be having any similar issues. Steady CO2 readings throughout the day (using a unit that I previously benchmarked in our home.)

I live in an area with a lot of outdoor pollution, so I have HEPA air filters in every room, but because of the high CO2 levels indoors I end up having to leave the windows open or I sleep terribly.

How would you go about identifying and correcting a problem like this?",4,2024-11-29 20:54:05
Where can I live in Canada that reduces wood smoke and fire smoke risk? ,"Hi all! My 2 year old has food allergies and now asthma. We dose her with a bit of her allergens each night to build up little tolerance so that she becomes bite proof - otherwise, her food allergies are life threatening.

The first such reaction. It was terrifying and I am traumatized. We are going to rent our house, move into a rental ourselves and look to buy here or elsewhere as long as we can be sure there is much less risk of wood smoke. There are so so few places around that are not smoky.

Built a PM sensor for $20,"As mentioned in my previous post (https://www.reddit.com/r/AirQuality/s/5RFJvExiWe) I ended up ordering a PMS5003 (PurpleAir and AirGradient devices already use this sensor for PM2.5 and PM10 readings), and already had an ESP8266 microcontroller lying around. Hooked up the PMS to the ESP, got some hybrid code from the web and ChatGPT, flashed it using Arduino IDE, and it works! (For those intimidated, I'm not a coder, just understand a little bit of it)

Next steps are to export the readings to a database and build a dashboard/graphs. And perhaps also export the data somehow to IQAir or AirGradient assuming it's possible to do so with a DIY monitor (and also if I decide to put everything in a case and mount it outside).

The first time I smelled it, I asked him point blank, and he said that he accidentally threw in some plastic, but I've smelled it numerous times since. I've always had a good relationship with him, so I don't want to accuse him of lying or start any kind of feuding, but my partner has asthma and it's also been acting up a lot more than usual this winter. I've told him this as well, so if he is burning plastic, it's extremely frustrating. Especially when our city offers free curbside pick up recycling services.

 I'd like to find a decent monitor that is possibly handheld so I can present indisputable data to him if it picks up an unusually high amount of plastic specific VOCs. I've been reading up on them, and perusing this sub, but I'm not feeling confident that I can find an affordable AQ monitor that will provide me with clear results. I know renting is an option, and I may have to go that route, so I my question is what would I be specifically looking for to buy or rent? Any ideas or general suggestions about my situation would be helpful. Thanks in advance for your time.",2,2024-11-26 21:55:16
Radon flip flop between safe and unsafe values. Is it normal?,,5,2024-11-25 05:52:19
What filter can I put on my window to clean the smoke out of fresh outside air?,"I really need fresh outside air, after being in my room too long I start to feel like I'm almost suffocating and opening the window really helps (and so I really need it open/cracked when I sleep). But some neighbors in the last year got wood burning heating, and there is always smoke in the air at night that inflames my asthma and makes me cough, and ruins my sleep. So I'm looking for a filter I can have in my window (probably with a box fan in front to push air through).

I tried an HVAC MERV 5, didn't work. And I just tried an HVAC MERV 12 (which I have read should be able to clean the smoke out of the air), this didn't work either, I was coughing like crazy from the air.

Do I need one of those thick 4 inch MERV 14 filters? Home Depot has this window filter, would this work: [https://www.homedepot.com/p/Activated-Carbon-Passive-Window-Air-Purifier-AC-1136/206386299?source=shoppingads&locale=en-US&gQT=1](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Activated-Carbon-Passive-Window-Air-Purifier-AC-1136/206386299?source=shoppingads&locale=en-US&gQT=1)

The strange thing is, we've only ever used MERV 5 in our HVAC I'm pretty sure, and we usually get pretty bad wildfire smoke in the Summers, and I've never had a problem breathing the inside air during those times.

"Does Mineral oil “burn off” fumes, vapor or gases?","Hello. I am a rain lamp collector and restorer/seller. I have about 26 rain lamps in my home. Sometimes more, depending on how many I’m restoring. They pump mineral oil up into an upper reservoir to drip down the strings to look like “rain”. The pumps/motors can get warm causing a thinner viscosity of oil and then it smells like crayons or burning fuel. I’m sure this can’t be good for the air I’m breathing in my house, although there is no information on such a topic. Can anyone help with IF breathing in mineral oil fumes, vapor or gases does any harm, what harm can/does it do and what kind of purifier would I need in my house to eliminate any such fumes, vapors or gases released?

"Just had Stachybotrys black mold professionally removed from my garage, what should I do next?","**Backstory:** I just had Stachybotrys black mold (professionally tested in a lab) removed from behind all of the walls in my 32‘ x 27‘ garage (about 850 ft.²). I just bought the house a year ago and I didn’t realize that behind all the drywall in the garage there was mold. The roof leaked for years and it was never fixed so that’s where the mold came from. Now, the roof does not leak and any active water leaks have been remediated.

The mold issue was professionally remediated. The drywall was removed and everything was sprayed with professional-grade mold killer, the air was fogged, and they used a HEPA vac to vacuum the whole garage. However, it still smells a little musty and I’m wanting to ensure that I’m taking further steps, as that’s what would make me feel more comfortable.

**What I'm looking for input on:** 3 purchases to be made: an air purifier, dehumidifier, and a HEPA vac.

I want to purchase an air purifier that is top grade that I can continually run in the garage even though the mold has been remediated. I’ve seen some mention that various technologies like UV light killing capabilities are helpful. I’ve also heard that PECO capabilities are also helpful. However, I’ve also heard that those don’t actually help with black mold so I’m confused on what technology is best regarding air purification. Some have said that if it doesn’t have UV light technology that the mold will just grow on the HEPA filter. I’ve seen the IQ air healthpro is rated as top notch but it doesn’t have UV light technology. I’ve also seen the MA-112 Air Purifier and iAdaptAir 2.0 - Pro do have UV light technology. **Can someone cut through the confusion and help me understand what air purification is best here?**

Obviously, high levels of humidity can encourage mold so I’d love to have a powerful dehumidifier. **What’s a great dehumidifier for this size space?**

Finally, I’d like to buy a HEPA vac (not a shop vac retrofitted with a HEPA filter). I’d like to keep it under $400 for this if possible, but I’ll spend more if that’s what it takes to have a good HEPA vac. **What's a good HEPA vac for this application?**",5,2024-11-19 17:30:35
New hardwood flooring offgassing terribly & VOC above healthy level,"Hello community! We are really bothered by the odor from our new hardwood floor and concerned with the unhealthy air in the house, we seek some help on troubleshooting it and how to deal with it.

**August 2024:** We replaced the original tiles & carpets in the new construction home with new Red Oak hardwood floor, with Bona Natural Seal (water based, supposed to be all natural and 0 smell), in many rooms. It was nailed down, no glue at all. Other rooms had the original tiles and carpets. This was the first thing done after the house was closed. And again it was a new construction home.  While the wood was acclimating in the house, we already noticed a very strong wood smell (that was unpleasant to a pregnant woman), which we thought probably because it was wood and probably it would go away. However, the problem is that, that smell sustained after the entire project was finished, and lasted until today.

**What we have done**: we've let windows open on sunny days during the day, turned ceiling fans on and added 4 other floor fans to accelerate air circulation in the house 24/7, and ran an air purifier on 24/7. We've done this for 2 months since the new floor was finished.

**Air Quality Issue:** finally we felt this is very abnormal so we got an air quality detector, which shows that in one of our storage rooms that has the new wood floor & no windows, no AC vent, so not much air circulation, the TVOC level is through the roof. We tested a few other rooms, and it basically suggests that the rooms with the original build carpet and tiles are having no air quality issues, and the rooms with the new wood floor are having higher TVOC levels after 12 hours of closed windows.

However the problem is that - all the google and youtube say that hardwood floor should have almost no TVOC. We don't understand why this is happening. If anyone has a clue or a guess on what went wrong, or any suggestions on how to get rid off the TVOC & odor problem, that would be super helpful!!

Looking for advice on filtration system against outdoor chimney fires,"Hello,

I am asking for your help because I say I am completely desperate.

I live in a neighborhood where the vast majority of homes are heated with wood fires, and therefore emit a lot of fine particles and other toxic gaseous substances.

I never know when I can open the windows because even if it doesn't smell like anything, the level of outdoor particles can be (what I consider) high (on average 50 for PM2.5 per evening, with peaks at 120um/m³) and it smells regularly during the day too (pm 2.5 going up to 20um) .

The level of particles can remain high all night, until around noon the next day.

I became aware of this 3 years ago, with the smell of smoke coming in through the air inlets of the house in the evening.
I also noticed that this caused physical reactions in the ENT area (only for me, not for my partner or my two children), with irritations of the tongue, throat and bronchi, sometimes making me cough for whole days. So I blocked all the air inlets in the house, and I air when I can.

All this affects me enormously because I am 100% teleworking and therefore exposed to these nuisances on a daily basis. Beyond the physical effects, it is on a psychological level that I am losing my footing.

So I would like to know if you have any recommendations for installing a system allowing us to protect ourselves from gaseous and particulate substances.

I have an air insufflation system, with a simple F7 / activated carbon filter but it does nothing against odors and irritations also appear. 

I was thinking of putting a box upstream with a MERV1900 filter or two, and a HEPA filter behind (I take this opportunity to ask if you know where to find real HEPA filters?). Then, behind the fan, I would have liked to put an in-line carbon filter, like those offered by Can Filters, but I saw that it should not be exposed to too high a humidity level (it can reach 100% at night, the area is very humid ).
But I have nowhere to put it indoors, only in the attic (not isolated). Would this still be feasible? If not, would there be an alternative? I'm really looking to neutralize these gases/odors. 

Excuse me for telling my life story, but I guess I'm feeling a little bit better to talk about it.

Thank you very much for any of your advices ! 🙂 ",5,2024-11-17 12:59:09

Should I pay $30k to rip up newly laid floors?,"My wife and I are gut renovating our townhome. We are pregnant, so we told our contractor that we preferred low/no VOC products to be you used. When it came time to lay the hardwood floors on the first and second level, he wound up using a high VOC solvent-based floor adhesive. This adhesive has chemicals with reproductive warnings too (toulene and n-hexane). 

We were pretty upset when we found out about this. Ripping out and replacing the floors would cost us $30k which we could technically do but it would really hurt the bank. Schedule wise we would also be cutting it close with when the baby is due so ripping them out is really a last resort situation.

To convince ourselves that the floors could stay we aired out the house regularly over the course of a 2-3 week period and then ran an indoor air quality test with the hope that the toulene levels would at least be in a moderate range and continue to come down over time. Unfortunately we got the results today...

\- Total VOCs = 3200 ng/L

\- Building Materials-Toluene Based = 730 ng/L

I wasn't as surprised by the tVOCs given we were putting a pause in the middle of the project and I'm sure there is stuff in the wait from the work being done. With that being said, the Toulene levels were ranked as ""Severe"" by the test. This is concerning since my understanding is a lot of the toulene should have off gassed by this point. Did we run the test too early? Should we give it more time? I'm worried about spending $30k to replace the floors and then something else being the contributor to the toulene. ",5,2024-11-02 01:13:10

How much more air pollution can our atmosphere take before breathing becomes problematic?,"Hi, I live in Belgium and when i see all this footage of industry and cars exhausting more and more pollution into the atmosphere, it honestly gives me anxiety. How much more air pollution can our atmosphere take before breathing would become seriously problematic? I live in Ghent, Belgium in case that makes a difference however isn't it so that increase in air pollution elsewhere can still affect breathing where you live since air travels. Actually my biggest concern if Trump gets re-elected is that he will give the oil industry free rain to do whatever they want even more.. and china and india are also still increasing fossil fuels.. I hope you know what i am trying to say.. like how much can our atmosphere really take before we reach a crucial point and how regional is this? Hope somebody can explain how worried i should be.

Different readings in air quality (Europe),"Hi,

I have been monitoring air quality in one area in the north of Spain (Asturias) for over a year to choose well where to relocate and live a long, healthy life. :)  
  
I have been using Plume and Google Maps (it provides information on air quality as well) but the values vary from each other, e.g. one app would show that the air quality is very good in one particular town and the other would show moderate air quality. 

I couldn't find a ton of information regarding how do these apps measure the air quality, Google just states that it picks the closest station to you. There's also the bit that the value that you are getting might not be the real value, but the value between the two or more closest stations. 

Could you give me some pointers to dig deeper? In your opinion, which is the most reliable source to measure air quality in Europe / Spain?

Thanks in advance and have a pollution free day. ",3,2024-10-28 13:35:57
What conclusions to draw from those measurements ?!,"I've been having air quality and breathing issues for sometime. There is often some kind of odor inside the house. Yesterday I decided to run some experiments using an air quality monitor.

Typically the Formaldehyde (HCHO) level / VOC is about 80-90 ug/m3 and 400 ug/m3 respectively.

After airing the house for a while, HCHO/VOC dropped to about 20/110 (ug/m3) 

Then turned off AC and closed windows. It seemed to jump really quickly over about 30-40 mins to about 50/240

After turning on AC and waiting over the same amount of time, it increased but seems at a slower rate. Not sure if because of air cleanup/filtering or the cooling effect of the AC but increased slightly to 60/310

Now I've been suspecting that there is some leak from the attic to my home. Often leaving the house for a while and coming back it smells like attic. Checking up in the Attic, I saw a reding of about 70/320 then as I come down from the attic, it's pretty much the same in the house. 

So not sure what the conclusion is . Possibly

* AC doesn't make things significantly worse
* Air quality in Attic is same as inside house. Does that mean there is a leak somewhere ?!
* Is the AC exonerated ? (since things didn't get significantly worse after turning on) or AC caused issues are only observable after running for a longer period of no ventilation because .... negative pressure buildup , duct leakage, etc.

Hope that made sense to someone out there.

"Positive pressure in a room in multifamily apartment
","Hi everyone,

I would highly appreciate it if you could share your expert knowledge

I live in an apartment in a multifamily house. The room size is 30 square meters. About 1 meter from my entrance door there is another apartment and the person smokes in the evening.

I use an air purifier, and the particulate matter concentration right next to the door near the bottom part of the door is about 100 micrograms per meter cube, which is a dangerous concentration. When I open the door, the PM concentration is 250. About 1 meter inside from the door, the PM concentration is 20, and right next to me, it is 5.

Regarding the Total volatile organic compounds, the level is about 1.1 milligram per meter cube when he smokes and goes to 0.5 mg after 3 to 4 hours when he stops smoking.

A small fan can not create enough positive pressure inside a room. But when I used a fan (20 watts) near the slightly opened window (6 cm wide opening with a length of 1.5 meters), the PM concentration at the bottom of the door decreased from 100 to 10, a 90 percent reduction. The window is located in another room. If I turn off the fan, the PM concentration comes back to about 100 micrograms per meter cube even if I open the window, so there is positive pressure created by the fan. Am I correct, or am I missing something?

I am happy with the effect, but now the winter has come, and I cannot open the window the whole day since it causes mold. I am planning to buy a carbon filter and fan with about 150-meter cube airflow. Furthermore, I am worried that since it created negative pressure, my room will be filled with the PM and VOC from the smoker's room. Do you guys have any advice for me ? Thank you very much for reading.",3,2024-10-24 12:19:18

Accuracy about the air quality monitor,"Hello, anyone has idea about the accuracy of this type of monitor? How does it work?



As I try, it does give some results which makes sense. When I go outdoor, the two numbers is like 0.01/0.01.

If indoor in my bedroom at night, it was 0.02/0.08 on one day. 

If I do cooking (with oil heating), the number goes to quite high level like 0.3/1.4. This I guess there are chemical from heating oil.

After open window for a while it can reduce and back to green level(<0.1 <0.5)  after two hours.

But this morning when I only stream cook some porridge, it also turned yellow for a while. This seems confusing that there should not be any harmful thing in porridge. Maybe I raise room temperature and cause more pollute from the painting?

Just wanted to share the results of a system test for my DIY forced forced ventilation rig with HEPA and carbon filtration. The apartment is 100 sq m, it's a rental unit in a relatively new house, hardwood floors. The ventilation air supply is at approx 150 m\^3 per hr, and the apt is pressurized (there is an always-on exhaust vent, but it has much weaker air flow). Aerosol particle counts are now down 10-20 fold across the board, whereas before I could only achieve a 2-3x reduction with windows closed, despite running three circulating indoor HEPA filters 24-7. The window through which the air is sucked in is a 2-pane DIY frame with 2 polycarb sheets and several 150mm-diam holes. CO2 stays below 800 all day (2 inhabitants) and below 600 in the bedroom where the vent is installed.

It's now around 50F at night and people around me have started burning wood at night (although everyone has gas and electric heating). Before I installed the system I could sense the burning smell (despite this being a new tight building). Now the smell is gone, and we no longer have to open the windows to vent (doing that lets in the polluted air and pollen in the summer). Helps with the smell of neighbors smoking, too.

I have a heat recovery unit ready to install as well, need to connect it downstream from the filters. I do not want to lose the pressurization though, need to think about this. ",6,2024-10-06 18:59:48

Need Advice on Potential VOC/Indoor Air Quality Issue in New Apartment,"I recently moved into a new apartment and have been noticing a strange smell every time I walk into the room. It’s hard to describe, but it almost feels like the kind of smell that could be coming from paint or something similar. The apartment was built in 2019, and there’s not a lot of furniture in the space, so I don’t think it’s from things like the floors or other common sources. My guess is they might have repainted part of one of the walls before I moved in.

I bought a $100 air quality monitor, and while I know it’s not the most accurate tool, I’ve been getting some concerning readings. When the windows are open, the formaldehyde levels are around 0.06-0.1 mg/m³, and when they’re closed, it goes up to about 0.13-0.18 mg/m³. VOCs are also showing around 0.3 with the windows open, and up to 0.6 when they’re closed.

Indoor air irritant list and how to detect them?,"I can't seem to find a detailed list of the ""top 10"" indoor air irritants, especially around things like allergies/sinus issues. Or, at the very least, if I should be detecting something that I'm not already.

I currently use an Air Knight to get PM2.5 (\~3-4ug/m3), CO2 (\~500-600ppm), humidity (45-65% depending on season), TVOC (\~0.02-0.06mg/m3), and HCHO (\~0.005-0.020mg/m3).

I'm curious if there's anything more I should be testing to try to get the least irritating indoor air. To the best of my knowledge, a PM2.5 sensor should already give an indication of things like dust and mold, and the Air Knight already has VOCs and CO2.

My house is old and is mostly solid wood framing and well sealed for it's age (\~3-4ACH@50, maybe lower after some recent improvements I did).

ERV to mitigate slight cigarette smell?,"Trying to help a friend who's not on here, any advice would be greatly appreciated.

The problem is third-hand smoke, house previously owned by heavy smokers. 2000 sq ft, in New England, built in 1984, ranch. When he first looked at the house, before buying, the smoke smell in the house was strong. Then the interior was repainted. Probably would have been a good idea to use Kilz primer, but it was the previous owner who did this.

After buying, but before moving in, for about a month he used an ozone generator, repeatedly, to treat the house. This almost completely eliminated the problem. Has now been in the house about a year. There's a hot-air furnace, natural gas, with central air. He had the vents cleaned. There's no carpeting.

The problem is that there's still a slight smell of cigarette smoke. Only noticeable for a few seconds when first entering. It seems to vary somewhat with temperature and humidity.

He has this instrument: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078ZS8RVL](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078ZS8RVL)

On that device he sees consistently low TVOC, roughly 0.1 mg/m3.

Today when I fried some parma ham my reading went through the chart throughout the house for hours. I didn’t burn anything and had the extractor fan running.

Surely this isn’t harmful, in contrast to leaving the log burner door open which would result in similar readings? 

Advice please as I’m new to using the monitor

Electronic air cleaner in furnace - is it useful? Anything better to consider?,"So, we're getting a new furnace (high efficiency gas furnace, climate won't allow for heat pump) and the HVAC guy mentioned there's a couple options for filters: standard filter (up to MERV 12) media cabinet filter and an electronic air cleaner filter that has a carbon filter built in. Is the electronic air clean worth paying for? Is there something better I should get to clean my furnace's air? The brand they use for electronic air clean is ""dynamics"". One of the people in our household has asthma and we all had a lot of radon exposure that recently ended in 1 person dying of lung cancer so we want to do what we can to optimize air quality so hopefully another one of us doesn't get lung cancer. Radon has been fixed.",4,2024-09-21 02:42:53
Seeking reliable outdoor air monitor,"Hello all.  I live in Los Angeles, and there's a house for sale I'm interested in purchasing.  The house is closer than 1000 feet to the nearest freeway (not too uncommon in LA), but if I'm going to be living less than 1000 feet from a freeway, I'd really like to test the outdoor air during the inspection period.  I'm hoping to take an outdoor monitor over to the property site and measure the air quality. (The house is unoccupied, and I should be able to do this without disturbing anyone.) I've been researching air quality monitors on Google and Amazon, and I see that most are indoor, although there do seem to be a few indoor/outdoor.  The thing that really troubles me is reliability.  Reviews seem to be all over the place, even for the same device.  I'd love to hear from folks that have used an air quality monitor OUTSIDE and feel satisfied with the results.  Thanks in advance!

How do I smoke-proof this heater vent?,"The person living below me smokes and I've thus far isolated the biggest source to be these heat vents.

I've figured it out because the bathroom has the same vents, so I duck taped it and aluminum foiled it and the smoke pollution has noticeably gone down in the bathroom.

The issue is, we realized that we need these vents for heat because shared heating...

So my plan is to buy 3M filters and fit them on... and maybe add a carbon filter -- I'm not sure.

I came here for other suggestions.

Ofc, there will also be a cr box involved somewhere to catch any stragglers.",4,2024-09-18 00:53:41
Best cheap VOC meter,"I already have the $50 VINDSTYRKA particle counter from IKEA, and I highly recommend it.  Anything cheaper is junk, and anything better is much more expensive.

What's the analogous product for measuring the amount of VOCs in the air?

I've built an activated carbon air purifier, and I have plans to build more of them.  Having a good VOC detector would allow me to see how effectively they're working and to determine if it's time to replace the activated carbon.  I know it's time to replace a regular air filter, because it darkens as it accumulates more and more dust and particles.  Activated carbon, however, does not change in appearance as it becomes saturated with VOCs.  Also, the activated carbon is hidden inside, so I don't get any visual indicator that it needs to be replaced.

The products that I'm considering buying are:

Treating car for mold,"Not sure if this is the right sub, but I have been extremely sensitive to mold since some exposure a long time ago.

It has worked out great.

Unfortunately, my wife does not do this and recently I have been having issues in her car.  I think there is some mold in the hvac system, and it seems hard to get rid of.  And it blows spores throughout the car and I have to frequently get it detailed and such.  I am now going to just buy some professional detail equipment (steam cleaner) and try to do this regularly myself, as the cost of detailing is getting too high.

Bought newly renovated home by mill terrible air quality,"Hello,

I purchased a newly renovated old home (the home is from 1950 but no major issues with it) and they redid everything.

I am seriously alarmed that we live about 10 minute away from a paper mill and occasionally the air quality level inside the house will jump from 0.10-0.20 tvoc to about 0.80 tvoc and I cough and it irritates my lungs.

I panicked and bought 2 air purifier with HEPA, charcoal filters that are industrial level and it barely makes a ding. It's not always this air quality but sometimes the mill runoff will come our way and be that high.

I'm having panic attacks beause I didn't realize we were so close to the mill. Will I get lung cancer form staying here? What else can I do? I wanna sell my house so fast now :(

Am I overreacting?

Activated carbon amount in air filters for room with people vaping,"I was wondering how much activated carbon you'd need to filter the air if you're vaping around 20ml of e-liquid a day in a room. Not all the e-liquid turns into vapor. Only about 70% gets vaporized, and a person would exhale about 50% of that into the room. So, if the person is vaping 20ml a day, roughly 7ml of vapor would end up in the air, which is 3.5g of PG and 3.5g of VG. Activated carbon can adsorb about 0.1g of PG or VG per gram of carbon. That means that the person would need around 70 grams of activated carbon per day to deal with the vapor. Over 6 months, that's about 12.6kg of carbon! Does this mean that air purifiers are useless when vaping?",3,2024-09-09 20:36:44

"Allergy-Like Symptoms in Guest Room - Air Quality Report Normal, Need Advice","Hey everyone, I'm dealing with a bizarre situation in my condo and could use some advice.

I live on the 30th floor of a condo building in the middle of a major city. About a week ago, I suddenly started experiencing allergy-like symptoms specifically in my guest room:

- Swollen feeling in my throat
- Chest tightness
- Slight difficulty breathing

These symptoms:

- Come on within minutes of entering the room
- Mostly go away when I leave the room
- Completely disappear when I leave the condo

Key points:

- I've lived here for 5 years with no previous issues
- No recent changes to the room (no new furniture, cleaning products, etc.)
- My girlfriend also experiences chest tightness in the room
- Building maintenance person reported a headache after being in the room
- The guest room is approximately 300 sq ft
- I have both Coway and Austin Air purifiers running in the room, which seem to help slightly but don't eliminate the issue

I had an air quality test done, which showed:

- No significant mold issues compared to outdoor levels
- Higher levels of particulate matter in the guest room vs. living room
- Full report: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/2sc0o33oibd2rq4ad2ckm/Air-Quality-Report.pdf?rlkey=rc3631a30sylvinf9hbcdpp01&st=tmi2wwjj&dl=0

My Airthings Wave monitor shows:

- Slightly elevated VOC levels (rated as ""fair"" at 300 ppb)
- Normal levels of CO2, humidity, and radon

Questions:

1. Any ideas what could be causing this?
2. Is it safe to be in the guest room? The rest of the condo?
3. What other tests or inspections should I consider?
4. Can anyone recommend a good easy to use air quality monitor for my situation? I was looking at the airthings view plus, but for pm it only does pm2.5 and since I have issues with pm2.5-10 and pm10, I didn't know if there was a better option.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. This situation is really stressing me out, and I'm concerned about potential health impacts.",4,2024-09-01 13:46:27

Tired of buying expensive custom filters with higher ratings? No problem! Here's a money saving hack! 😃 ,"**WARNING**

I DO NOT recommend trying out this hack with your HVAC/Furnace. For those systems, please continue to buy the correctly sized and rated filters by reputable manufacturers.

**TESTED DEVICES**

I have only tested this with the following devices:

1. Fresh-Air Ventilators (such as the Aprilaire 8145)
2. Dehumidifiers (such as the Aprilaire E80)
3. Car Cabin Filters.

**THE PROBLEM WITH THE MANUFACTURER SUPPLIED FILTERS**

As you may know, many devices come with a manufacturer supplied filter. These filters are often rated at a pitiful MERV 8, or lower. In other words - in the air quality world, it's good for filtering out leaves, and bugs. 🙄

Also, if you run a fresh-air ventilator, or a dehumidifier with such a filter, you will essentially be sucking in polluted air, into your home.

These manufactures are happy to sell you an *upgraded* filter at an exorbitant price. This is not a viable solution.

**SOLUTION**

Go on Amazon, and search for ""MERV 13 Material."" Cut these sheets and ""wrap"" them around your filter. In most cases, the enclosure of your device will hold the material tightly in place.

Now, the big question is: Is the material you are getting, *truly* rated at MERV 13? It's hard to say, but it is certainty a step in the right direction. You might want to experiment with different suppliers, and run actual tests, but anecdotally speaking, this has worked out quite well for me, as I'm able to run the fresh-air-ventilator in my home, almost constantly, without a substantial increase in 0.3 particulate matter, and bringing down VOCs to a bare minimum.

**THINGS TO WATCH OUT FOR**

* If you implement this in your car cabin filter, you might get a whistling noise, due to the restricted air-flow. You might want to use a single-sheet, in this case, versus wrapping up the entire filter on both sides.
* Personally, I would stay away from material which is made from ""fiberglass,"" but a materials expert can chime in on this.",3,2024-08-21 13:30:18

Does anyone have any insights into why the PM2.5 and PM10 levels are so high right now?",5,2024-08-21 10:48:31
Air quality monitor with PM10 and PM2.5,"Hi,

I am looking a reliable air quality monitor that can measure PM10, PM2.5 and PM1. I hope that the experience of this subreddit could point me in the right direction.

I want a device that will trigger with Mold spores, hence the PM10. Also I want it to trigger with Mycotoxins (PM2.5 and PM1)

Thanks in advance ",6,2024-08-20 15:20:35

Working in artist studio - recent health issues. Landlord says it's all in my head?,"I work in a warehouse-converted artist studio, for around 8\~14 hours a day. The place is full of parceled rooms without any windows, ventilation provided by a small rectangular window above the doors opening out into the hallway.

Ever since around November of last year, I've been having weird breathing and heart rate issues. Even minor physical activity (lifting a \~40lb box or walking up 3 flights of stairs) would often have me running low on breath, and I had a couple of scary weeks where I would have extreme difficulty breathing combined with rapidly falling heart bpm, to the point that I fell down a couple of times from nearly fainting. Only solution to those episodes I found so far is to move my arms and legs constantly (like doing squats) to apparently force blood to flow.

I recently got a VOC meter (this one - [https://www.amazon.com/BRWISSEN-Pollution-Particulate-Analyzer-Formaldehyde/dp/B08K7DTKN2/](https://www.amazon.com/BRWISSEN-Pollution-Particulate-Analyzer-Formaldehyde/dp/B08K7DTKN2/) ) from recommendation of a friend, and VOC reading suggests the concentration in studio often goes up to 3.4 mg/m3 and rarely a bit over 6 mg/m3. This happens for at least a couple of days a week. On a 'normal' day the background VOC level is around 1.2\~2.0 mg/m3

For reference, prior to last November I used to go to gym every other day and jog in the morning for about 5 miles. Now I can't really do those things for fear of collapsing.

It really feels like sudden change in air quality might have something to do with the relatively recent issues - what do you think? Do the numbers mentioned above and the symptoms sounds like they could correlate?

I've been trying to talk to building management about this - but they're asking for proof that I was healthy before these events, and I'm not quite sure how that would even be medically possible. The floor manager is suggesting the VOC meter is too cheap to be reliable and I might have a psychological problem of some sort, which had been more than a bit creepy, I have to say.

I also visited a public clinic (no health insurance here, I'm afraid) to get some sort of diagnosis, but they're unable to actually run any physical testing, just do face to face diagnosis.

So - what do you think might be happening? Is the VOC level being read by the device actually high? Is anyone familiar with the sort of symptoms I'm facing? I'm really on my own here, so any advice would be appreciated!

  
EDIT: okay, judging from the comments, I think only clear path forward is to get out of this place when I can. Thank you to everyone who took the time to respond! ",4,2024-08-18 20:44:08

Window fan versus air purifier ,I have some VOCs in my kitchen due to mastic that was used for the tile backsplash in my kitchen (I had no idea it was a thing…have only had contractors use thinset before). I’m chemically sensitive and it’s still smells bad for me after almost 2 months.  I can’t be in or near the kitchen unless the fan has been blowing at the window for at least an hour. Question - will an air purifier work as well as the fan in the window? I’m trying to decide if I should have it all ripped out or if an air purifier will work as well as the fan in the window once the weather turns cold?

Can’t figure out why I feel so allergic since new floors were put in. Please help.,"

They took out asbestos tiles and used pretty heavy chemicals. They claimed they cleaned them off pretty well but we’ve been having reactions with the clothing dryer and gas burners. There’s a petroleum smell when those appliances are in use. It has dissipated some.

They added wood floors on top of the exposed concrete. 

Since then my allergies have been horrible. I rarely used to have allergies. It was very mild. I can’t figure out why this is happening. We did leave the windows open for a while to air out my house after they removed the asbestos because of the chemicals. Unsure if possibly dust and pollen came in? I can’t figure out if the chemical solvents are making us allergic? 

The wood flooring they used supposedly are low VOC. 

I did get an air purifier so I’m hoping that will help but I’m feeling really miserable.

Two different readings,"Our ecobee thermostats (we have two: one on the second floor and one on the main floor) both read that the air quality in our house is poor.

What are the reasons for elevated CO2,"Hi All,

I have bought a flat, which has 2 bedrooms. The master has a CO2 reader and over night when I am alone, the CO2 levels reach over 1100PPM.

I am alone, the room is about 3,80 x 3 x 2,30 meters which is 26 cubic meter & has an ensuite bathroom. I opened all the window until going to bed and had readings of 400PPM, but at night, It reaches 1000PPM. Which seems excessive for the volume of room I have. 

 I thought there might be an  issue with the bathroom, so I closed the ensuite bathroom door, kept the door of the room opened, bought another sensor out of Amazon and both reached 998 and 1024 over the next night (that's a marginal difference).

Could it be me? Could it be something else? is it possible that I alone fill a room ?",6,2024-07-27 06:53:18

CO2 Level Increases from 400 to 1400 While Daughter Sleeps,"I'm looking for strategies to improve the air quality in my daughter's room. I just purchased an Airthings Wave Plus, and the CO2 ppm in her room steadily increased from 400 to 1400 as she slept. We did not have her window or door open. I'm hoping to find ways to keep the CO2 ppm below 700 without any manual intervention, such as opening a window. We will certainly try keep the AQ better by opening her window/door and creating a cross breeze, but we generally sleep pretty well through the night from 10-6 and prefer not to schedule alarms to open windows.

Our house was built in 2004 and has an HVAC system that was recently serviced. Still, I plan on checking the air intake myself. I also plan on checking the air quality throughout the rest of the house at night to see if it's isolated to the rooms where people are sleeping. I know an HRV/ERV would be ideal, but we plan on selling our home soon, and I don't want to spend $5k on something that is unlikely to increase the value of my home.

Her door has a wide opening, so I'm a little surprised more air isn't circulating into her room from the rest of the house (where the AQ is theoretically better). I was thinking something like a window vent with a fan that can be scheduled to open would be ideal (not having much luck finding one though). I'm also considering installing a door vent to help. Would something like a box fan by her door have a meaningful impact?  We live in the Pacific Northwest, which has a relatively mild climate. I was considering keeping her window cracked at night as an option, but my wife is not in favor of this since we usually run our AC or furnace.

Looking forward to hearing how you all improved bedroom air quality!

"PM 2.5 is a flawed metric, and here is why:","The metric known as ""PM 2.5"" includes all particles of that size, and *smaller*.

https://preview.redd.it/cfuj239a9wed1.png?width=2407&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e471eeeaa2d45c11675b52e1a8c5af5056d9506

# Misleading Interpretation

This can give people a false sense of security because they assume that because their PM 2.5 reading accounts for smaller particles, including PM 0.3, and PM 0.1, it is a good indicator of general air quality.

Yes, and no.

In any given space, larger particles will naturally provide a higher mass contribution.

Smaller particles, even though they may be *more numerous*, will contribute *less* mass individually.

In other words, let's consider these outdoor readings from this dual-sensor monitor:

https://preview.redd.it/jgtdght5hwed1.png?width=549&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7c197ed6af2ea9e23e74a44ac0f431568c7474f

The 2.5um reading is at a very good 0-2 particles / deciliter.

However, the 0.3um reading of 804-152 raises a number of questions.

These are particles which are in fact, more harmful to you than the larger ones. You might be inclined to believe that the PM 0.3 count, and the PM 2.5 count has a linear relationship. Yes, it is correlated. As PM 2.5 values increases, PM 0.3 will do the same - but this is **not always the case**.

You can have very low PM 2.5 readings, and significantly high PM 0.3 readings, at the same time.

and we haven't even begun diving into the smaller particles - which make up the vast majority of all airborne particles.

# Current Guidelines

While the World Health Organization provides guidelines for PM 2.5 at 5 ug/m3 over an entire year, and 15 ug/m3 over a 24-hour period. It provides no guidelines for smaller particles - and this makes sense. Do you really need a ""guideline"" to tell you that you should not be around car-exhaust, cigarette smoke, or various industrial emissions?

# What is the Solution?

The long-term societal solution, is to obviously implement stricter emissions regulations for industries and vehicles, but as an individual, you can do two things for yourself right now:

1. Invest in an air purifier (ideally, one for each room) which filters particles down to at least, the 0.3 level.
2. Track your air quality not just on the PM 2.5 level, but also on the PM 0.3 level.

Here's is a visual from my home. The large numbers are PM 0.3 readings, and the smaller number of 0 is the PM 2.5 reading.

Diatomaceous Earth Exposure Advice,"I am not sure if this is the place to post but I did something very stupid. Upon discovering late at night that we had a flea infestation, I read that diatomaceous earth could be spread over the rugs and that it was a safe alternative to chemical bombs and such. I spread it everywhere before realizing I'd created a cloud of dust I was inhaling. I closed off the door to that room, but my partner said he could smell all throughout the house. The next day, I decided to do things ""right"" and wore a dust mask and goggles and spread it on the stairs. I then vacuumed much of it up, once again, creating a massive cloud. Basically I had been breathing in DE for quite some hours to the point that my eyes are dry, mouth and throat dry and irritated. The mask did not work. I had the mask off while doing other things the rest of the day in the house, not realizing the whole house smelled of it still. My baby and partner were in the next room over with the door closed for much of this, but I am so beyond worried about them and myself.  I read, AFTER doing this about silicosis and how dangerous this stuff is. I can't sleep I am so worried and when I called the doctor they had not even heard of diatomaceous earth before. 
Does anyone know how worried I should be about developing long term problems from this relatively short but heavy exposure?
Also, does any have any suggestions on how to get it all cleaned up?

Need advice... where to start?,"We moved into a house in a subdivision about 2 and a half years ago. We are renting. 

My husband's health has become considerably worse the longer we've lived here. He is 35 and in the last two years we've gone to so many doctors and none of them have figured out the problem. I've blamed the stupid health system (which is still probably part of the problem) but now I'm wondering if it is the air quality in the house.

He has a headache every day, constant ear infections and sinus infections. We've had MRI done to check for brain tumors, he's had the camera in sinuses, he's had allergy tests and allergy medication. Nothing seems to help or point to a cause. 

Last week we went to new york for a vacation for 5 days. During that time he didn't have any headaches, within minutes of being home, he's got a headache again. And you would think the air quality in New york would be worse, but  It's got to be something here. Noone else in the house has as severe of symptoms but maybe we just aren't as susceptible  

So with all that said where do I start? I was googling air quality tests at home and looking here on reddit. Can't make heads or tails of it.  Do we get a professional? How much does a professional cost? What do we test for? If we get home tests, which brand? Again what to test for?
And since we are renting, can we require the landlord fit the bill or are we on our own?
If we so find out there is a problem, who has to pay to fix it, us or the landlord? Well its not really a normal landlord either it's one of those big corporations that own obscene number of homes. We never have seen a human that works for them the entire time we've been here.

Super high VOCs in bedroom at night,"We have Airthings meters in every room of our house.  We live across the street from a small mall that has a dry cleaner and several small restaurants.  Roughly every other day or 3 days we get high VOC readings at night only in our bedroom, which faces the street and the mall.  These highs are usually in the 2,000 to 3,000 ppb range.  The last few nights they have been @ 8,900.  No-one is there at night and we don’t see anything unusual, but we assume the mall must be the source of the problem.

We’ve read the comments about how consumer grade VOC meters measure total numbers for undisclosed compounds and may not be that accurate.  Could this be an artifact?  I did place the meter outside yesterday to try to clear it, so this high reading is about 24 hours after the trip outside.  Would buying a second meter for comparison be a good plan?  If so, what brands might be better to try than Airthings?

Now that we are seeing these numbers we are very concerned, but what can we do in this situation?  We thought of going to the town or state officials to see if they could do anything for us, but we are very doubtful we would see any positive results.  Would hiring some sort of air quality consultant help (is there such a thing?).  If we reported this to town or state officials, what would that mean when we try to sell our house?  Thanks in advance.",5,2024-07-05 02:45:39

What is the cleanest fuel to use when cooking outdoors?,"A friend of mine took a firepit grill down to the beach the other day which is pretty poor for general AQ emissions.  Inefficient and polluting!

Assuming efficiency in terms of flame heat to pot is equal between all options, what is the cleanest fuel to use when bbqing?  Something like a butane gas canister?  Or is propane cleaner?  I'm most intersted in pollution hazardous to health like pm2.5, NOx, CO?

Some people I know use methylated spirits when hiking (trangia), would this be more polluting than the gas canister?  Some other burners can even use benzene, kerosene or even unleaded petrol.  Some gas canisters use different mixes such as butane & isobutane or butane & propane and other mixes.

Which fuel has the lowest level of health harming emissions?

Any recommendations for keeping weed smoke from escaping an apartment?,"I recently moved into a new 1-bedroom apartment in an older building. I use weed medication and used to smoke indoors without issues by locking myself in the bathroom with the vent on. However, some neighbors have complained about the smell in a nearby common room. I suspect the smoke is escaping through the vent.

After some research, I found that many people recommend vaping or using a carbon-filtered fan to manage the smoke. I’m fine with my apartment smelling, but I don’t want it to bother others. I plan to stop using the bathroom vent and would like a good carbon filter fan to eliminate the odor.

Can you suggest a reliable, cost-effective carbon filter fan that works well with weed smoke?

I'm also open to other methods aside from not smoking inside. The room in the apartment I plan on smoking in now is about 500 square feet, and while opening windows might help with vaping, I'm worried the smell might still be noticeable to others, especially with the heat and windows open.",7,2024-06-27 01:41:10

Oil based polyurethane ,"Hello, we recently got our hardwoods floors refinished and we were not informed about the dangers of oil based polyurethane. I have some health problems and severe chemical sensitivity. I only use clean products that are ewg verified. Our other flooring is no VOC marmoleum. I only buy 0 VOC paint. We spent money on mold testing to make sure our house was 100% safe with mold. I’m not sure how I missed this and overlooked this but it has me feeling like all my efforts to have a safe environment are now wasted. They used lenmar over 500 VOC oil based polyurethane. I didn’t know that water based was a safer option that we could have used until after the fact and I didn’t know that the oil based off gases for so long. We are not currently living at the house but we’re looking to move in in two weeks which is no longer going to happen. We have a cat with asthma and my boyfriend has asthma as well. I really don’t know what to do. We spent 3,000 on this service which is a lot of money for us but I am wanting to get it resanded off and resealed with water based poly but it’s not finically possible for us and I was told our hardwoods couldn’t be sanded again because they are 1/4 in height. What can we do to make our environment safer? This has made me extremely depressed after what I have been through with my health and how much effort I have put in up until this point for a safe environment. ",3,2024-06-25 15:01:51

PM2.5 sensor gives erratic result in the office,"Hi,

I used a consumer grade air quality sensor to monitor the air quality at my office. This is the result at my cubicle:

https://preview.redd.it/80hd24rl0d8d1.jpg?width=549&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cdcdd31947e98be134ecbd03a1878b7652bcbcda

As you can, the AQI is 240 and the PM2.5 is 190 ug/m\^3.

But just a few steps away, at the hall way, here's the result:

https://preview.redd.it/aw9v97yr0d8d1.jpg?width=634&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9620fc430c2fcd57d3f51ccc0cdc12c0087d5c25

The AQI in the hallway is 28 and PM2.5 is 6.8 ug/m\^3.

I walked back and forth between the 2 areas and got similar result, so I'm really curious why. There isn't any air current that I'm aware of from the HVACs and given the proximity and open space between the 2 areas you'd think there shouldn't be such a big difference. I used another air quality sensor and got around 5 ug/m\^3 for PM2.5 at both locations.

This makes me wonder if the sensor in question is bad or is it subject to some kind of interference at my cubicle (there is a lab next to it). This was done after most people have left, so no one is cooking or doing activities that might cause the discrepancy. This is making me a bit concerned.

Anyone else have similar experience with these sensors?

Is this normal when turning on air handler?,"I bought an air quality monitor and ran it in a few rooms around my house. It’s not a high end monitor and understand some may not read correctly. Levels were pretty much good in every room. I turned my ac on and set it on the vent. I got poor results pretty quickly from the vent. Wondering if this is somewhat normal or if I should be concerned and look into it further. 

Little back round: House is 1980 split level in PNW. Furnace was installed in 2012. Serviced and sanitized 3/10/23. Ducts cleaned too. New heat pump installed 2022. House has been abandoned at least once for a year before I bought it in 2020. I found mold inside one wall redoing a bathroom downstairs and replaced a section of drywall. Checked all surrounding walls to make sure it wasn’t further. Noticed down inside one vent in an upstairs bathroom there was rust in the duct. Air reading from furnace intake vent was ok.

1st picture is before turning ac on and 2nd picture is after. 3rd picture is just the unit I purchased. 4th is the vent with rust. I didn’t take the reading from that vent. ",3,2024-06-16 17:29:30

Is this a symptom of mould exposure? Or what else could it be?,"I moved in to a house 3 weeks ago, but have just broken the lease.  
I had migraines, brain fog, lethargy, sore lungs, severely dry sinuses, was always thirsty, sore skin and my brain just seemed like it was shutting down.

I cleaned the house yesterday and returned the keys. The clean was brutal, I felt so ill. (The only evidence of possible mould was some previously water damaged floorboards from an old leak).

But my most scary symptom was last night immediately after when I went out for dinner. Walking from my car to the restaurant felt severely laboured and then at one point when I was sitting down I went to open my mouth half way through eating - and it just wouldnt open. it only lasted a moment, I tried again and all was good. Nothing has felt locked so much, it was more like my mouth just didnt respond for a moment from when my brain told it to open.

(Note: I have Cronhs which makes me immunocompromised and I take immunosupressants meaning I could be a little moire vulnerable around certain moulds etc)

Recovering from mould to VOC exposure?,"I moved into a house 3 weeks ago that made me very sick.

- Headaches
- Brain Fog & dizziness 
- Sinuses felt in fire
- Dry throat & extreme thirst
- ear wax build up
- Dry skin & cracked lips
- Sore lungs
- Could no longer exercise without feeling severely ill 
- Depression & lethargy and a lot of trouble getting out of bed in the mornings 
- Generally feeling like my brain was slowing down

I’ve just broken the lease and am getting the hell out of there. I have ulcerative colitis and take immunosuppressants which is known to make allergies and reactions to mould worse. The landlord was a mum and daughter who had just moved out after living there for 12 years and I believe they never experienced any symptoms. (Making it unlikely it was used as a meth lab etc)

2 rooms made me feel sicker than the others, but they all made me ill. There were multiple bedrooms and I tried sleeping in different ones with no real improvement. I didn’t see any mould built up but there was a little bit of old water damage to floorboards from a washing machine having once overflowed. One friend stayed for a few days and said on the first day it smelt slightly of mildew. Another said he got a headache instantly when he walked in the master room (he’s super sensitive)

I tested for C02 (it’s an Australian house and wasn’t connected to gas but I was desperate to try anything). I ran a high end $500 air purifier with HEPA and Carbon filters and every day had all ceiling fans on and windows open. Nothing brought relief. I never found out for sure if it was black mould or VOCs or something else. As a tenant I couldn’t stop the $1000s required on testing and why bother when the remedy would probably not be so simple.

Today is my last day in the house, I’m packing up and moving out (Luckily the house was already furnished so there’s not a huge amount to do).

Walking into my new place (that I’ve lived in previously with no issues) I noticed that I’m hypersensitive to smells and even feeling a little ill here. (Within a few minutes of being there)

Is this normal after such exposure? 

Is there much I can do to focus on healing?

Hi all, I had a previous post RE: TVOC reading of 6,200ng/L in our finished attic, and a chemical smell that I detected upon move in but they told us it was new house smell. I knew it wasn’t because our basement smells like typical new house smell but the attic had a distinct chemical smell. They think it’s because the drywall was put up too soon after the open cell spray foam. The contractor has hired someone to perform a bake off but thinks we should be okay if the levels get to 800ng/L, but I was reading levels above 500ng/L cause affects in some people. Note this space is a shared office for my husband who works from home and an attic for my 3 and 8 year old children.  It isn’t something I’m trying to gamble on. He said the guy who tested it says 500 is only possible for an unoccupied space, but the report from the same guy is citing 500-1500 to cause affects in some people.  It seems like lip service. They think it’s impossible to have TVOCs sub 500 in an occupied home. I’ve looked it up online and it doesn’t seem true. I’ve also looked at some of the air quality posts, are you guys only achieving sub 500ng/L in the presence of an air purifier or can you get a reading like that without one  (assuming nobody is cooking, cleaning, farting using hand sanitizer) etc. If you mention levels in your response can you please use units so I can convert our reading.

"Indoor Air Quality device for: Co2, CO, VOC and 2.5ppm","In my professional life I use meters and monitors w/ 10.6 PID and bump calibration tests so I'm aware of how to use PPM and the effects on the body.  


Residential/consumer level devices though I have zero experience with. There are significant fakes it appears on the market as well as inaccurate sensors and I'm not used to having to sift through for good sensors.   


What device should I be looking at that does  Co2, CO, VOC and 2.5ppm? While I'd like formaldehyde there is probably enough cross sensor between HCHO and CO to not be an issue but it seemed surprising that most residential sensors had a C02 and VOC sensor but not a CO.

Ions for purification?,"I don’t want to pretend to be an expert, but I’ve read a lot about how ions could potentially be harmful in air purifiers, especially if they produce ozone. For other radicals, I don’t know if the science is really there to tell us if they are harmful. 

I am currently in the process of shopping for new AC for my home and the company wanted to sell me units that generate OH(-) radicals. 

What have you all read about the safety of using ions for air purification? Do you think the pros (reducing VOCs, mold growth, etc…) might actually outweigh potential cons?

There is no way to turn this setting off. Any thoughts on this? Would you go for a model like this?

Ventilation in a house without HVAC,"In our area, most of the homes are quite old and don't have ducts or an HVAC system. Just radiators and a boiler--no central air or forced heat.

We're looking at buying a bigger house that may not have an HVAC, even as there is increasingly a ""smoke season"" from Canadian wildfires.

So my question is, how crucial to air quality is having an HVAC system with ducts? Are there other effective ways to ensure air circulates through a house? Would an ERV/HRV be enough to ensure fresh air is circulating everywhere? We can get minisplits installed, but this doesn't help with air circulation or filtering?

In our current townhouse with central air, we can keep the house fan going during times of smoke and feel pretty secure about our air having decent PM 2.5 at least. I don't want to spend a bunch of money moving into an old house, but have our air quality worsen.

We don't mind having individual air purifiers in at least some rooms, fwiw.

Air Quality Sensor for the home - on Kickstarter,"Hello to everyone in this community,

After months of tinkering and prototyping, I'm excited to share that I'm launching an [Air Quality Sensor on Kickstarter today.](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pierdr/air-quality-sensor-by-studio-luff) 

**A little bit about my story**

Living on the West Coast, air quality has been a major concern due to traffic pollution and wildfires. To address this, I've been working as a personal project on an artful air quality sensor designed for home use. 

  
Here are some **key features of the sensor**:

- Designed to be a beautiful object that can blend into your home environment, yet customizable and Arduino-compatible.

- Utilizes a best-in-class air quality sensor module, typically found in premium commercial products.

- Respects privacy by storing data locally on an SD card, without any external data collection.

As someone passionate about air quality, I believe this sensor can provide valuable insights while also serving as an aesthetic addition to your living space.

Comparing outdoor air quality ,"Hi All, I am looking for recommendations on air quality sensors to compare air quality (outdoors) around where I live now and where I am looking to move. My thought is to bring the sensor to both places on a few different days and collect data for a little while then compare. Thanks to a link someone posted on this group I see the Atmotube Pro and Davis units are reasonably accurate for the price point. However I’m looking for confirmation that this type of sensor fits my situation. 

More background:
I currently live in a city and am looking at moving to a more rural area. The place we like the most is unfortunately only 1,500 ft from a very large manufacturing facility that melts recycled steel. I see steel facilities in the news for being a terrible contributor to unhealthy air in their vicinity but don’t know if this specific facility is the same. Online at sites like AirIQ I can’t find local sensors. The property is nicer than I would otherwise be able to afford which is a red flag so I am guessing one thing keeping people away is this manufacturer. The land between the facility and the house is just a big grass field owned by the manufacturer, otherwise no real obstructions so it’s a clear view of the facility.  Not the most visually appealing scenery for being out in the country but personally compared to the dense area I live now it is in my opinion a huge improvement. Would particulate measurements be adequate or being a steel mill type facility would I need something capable of measuring specific gasses/chemicals as well? (which I’m guessing I cannot afford hahaha)

Any thoughts or advice are really appreciated. ",3,2024-05-02 18:00:54

My method called 3 pronged approach. Having more than 2 fans.,"I call this the 3 pronged approach. Have a simple window fan you can get this anywhere amazon etc for $40. This fan gets your bad air or CO2 build up out the window. Then anywhere near it, 3 feet or so, get a fan with a HEPA filter. This fan will filter our dirt, dust, pollen giving YOU more time in your life simply because instead of spending a lot of time cleaning, dirt and dust just gets collected. These types of fan cost anywhere from $40 to $80, but just get a cheaper one because they're almost the same, just make sure your HEPA filter is affordable too, but you don't even need to buy new ones, just wash them with boiling water every after 2 or 3 months. Next is your LAST fan, and this can be a normal vertical standing fan or you can go a little fancy, such as getting one with an ionizer, or activated carbon.

This last fan makes sure that the air CIRCULATES, this is important because even if it's a home made office room or a small apartment room hybrid bedroom CO2 build up can only take 20 minutes! Even faster with 2 people. You wonder why you wake up easily or become a light sleeper even if you're healthy and fit? CO2 build up. CO2 stays in front of your face while sleeping, have the third fan rest at the bottom of your bed or at another corner of your room to have the air circulating. Boom. You just made your room healthier and better. Plus, you can literally just save money on electricity with the ice method, your fridge builds ice for free, grab a small bucket or freeze a water bottle, put them BEHIND the THIRD fan or you can with two or one or three, then boom, you have colder air. FOR FREE. Last resort, if you really want to take it to another level, get a portable solar generator.

I know this can cost anywhere from $300 to $500, but they do go on sale, you can even just get a $100 one, these types of battery (non gas) generators are still catching up when it comes to tech and I don't think they'll advance any further due to law of thermo and size, but a simple portable power station that is SOLAR can literally run these 3 fans. SAVING you $ since you wouldn't need A/C, and giving you MORE healthier sleep, plus running these fans act as a good white noise, muting out bird chirps early in the morning if you're on a grave yard shift and need to sleep half of a day. Just literally put the solar panels hang them out our window, run these three fans, BOOM. Live a healthier lifestyle, thank me later.

TL;DR - It's a science to learn CO2 and air management for healthier indoor living or work from home living, it takes a long time but just know that air circulating is better than nothing.",6,2024-04-27 17:25:12

What does this color dust mean?,"The title is pretty much my question. This is the air purifier in my bed room. For context, I don't notice any issues with my breathing/sleeping or allergies.

Which air quality monitor is worth getting? I mainly want it for PM and CO2,"These are ones that have decent reviews and are available in Australia:

Awair Element Indoor

Airthings View Plus

Atmotube Pro Portable Air Quality Monitor + SAF Aranet4 Home

Qingping

There's no clear winner, everything has negative reviews.

Alternatively, I could buy a Dyson Big and Quiet Formaldehyde BP04. Are the air quality monitors accurate? It does monitors what I want, and it would be an extra 1k AUD over most of the recommended monitors. It has auto mode which monitors the air and would reduce filter costs.

My current purifier is the IQAIR HealthPro Plus, and the filters all need replacing, which is why I was looking into the monitor. I was wondering about the rooms air quality. I only use the IQAIR in one room, a bedroom which also has a PC in it. The room is used for 16-20 hours a day. I thought monitoring the air could also help reduce filter costs and let me know when I need to open the windows.

The room seems to get dusty. The bottom of the IQAIR every now and then has large chunks of dust stuck to it which creates dust bunnies. I get a good handful after removing it.

The replacement cost for the IQAIR filters is $825 AUD. So, the Dyson would be around the same price of buying IQAIR filters plus the majority of options for the air monitors.

The other choice would be IQAIR AirVisual monitor pro,

The air quality monitor from IQAIR says, ""AirVisual Series air quality monitors include laser-scattering PM sensors that measure particulate matter in ambient air ranging from 0.3 to 10 microns in real time. This includes measurements of PM1, PM2.5, and PM10."" Yet I only see pm2.5 on the device.

Bryan Johnson, a man worth hundreds of millions of dollars, spends millions a year on all his health stuff and has his own team of experts. He uses the AirVisual monitor pro in his house, despite the fact that he could afford to buy anything. However, there are many negative reviews about its accuracy. I could probably do a deal with the local distributer and get it cheaper if I buy the filters and a monitor at the same time.

What do I buy? frustrating industry this one :)

Dry/Irritated Eyes - Air Quality Issue?,"I'm really struggling to get to the bottom of what could be causing my dry and irritated eyes and have seen several specialists who are stumped as well. I'm now turning to Reddit as a last(ish) resort to see if anyone might have some ideas. My dry eyes started about a year ago, and have been persistent ever since, but are only really noticeable when I wake up (unless wearing contact lenses). It sounds daft, but I'm not 100% sure I have dry eyes, or whether they're just irritated. I've had my tear quality and quantity measured and both are normal. The only time I noticeably get some relief from my symptoms is if I sleep somewhere other than my home, though this isn't always the case, which makes me think it may be environmental, perhaps an air quality issue, but I'm still not sure.

Things I've tried:
- Loads of eye drops and gels that do very little
- Ditching contact lenses
- Humidifier
- Air purifier
- Eye mask
- Moisture chamber goggles
- Antihistamines 
- Anti-allergy drops
- Improving airflow by leaving my bedroom door open (this seems to help a tiny bit)

I live with my girlfriend and our bedroom is small. The symptoms seem to be worse if we're sleeping in the same room as eachother (I get some relief when she's on a night shift). Humidity never seems to drop below 50%. One thing I've noticed is that CO2 in our room can hit 1500ppm by the morning if we're both in there, but that's not really high it seems based on internet searching I've done and I still get symptoms at around 800-1000ppm. Having said that, improved airflow does seem to offer a little bit of relief. Our house is brand new, as was my previous house where the symptoms started. My parents live in an old house where I get no symptoms. Unfortunately I can't get some HVAC solution to check if it's an air quality issue, as we're in the UK and our houses aren't built with them or with provision for them and even if I could that'd be a massive cost for something that may not help. 

I'm completely lost quite frankly, anyone got any ideas?",4,2024-04-17 11:24:15
Air purifier indicating bad values for toxic gas every night,"I have a Philips air purifier standing in my studio apartment and, every night, around 11 pm or so, it starts indicating bad values for gas (L2 or L3, for those familiar with these devices) and running on high speed for hours.

Burning in sinuses,"Looking for ideas on next steps for triage.

Been dealing with respiratory/Sinus issues in my house for at least 4 months now. Probably longer, but I left for awhile and came back to a pretty strong reaction. Since then, Ive been living with a buddy and slowly trying to see what might be causing the issues. Been lurking on here for a stretch - thanks for the Aranet and AirThings recs. I'm also running a Dyson BP04.

As mentioned in title of post, my sinuses start to burn after being in the house for 4+ hours. It also comes with some pretty serious brain fog which usually clears up in a day or two. 

Seems like I am mostly battling VOCs according to the Dyson and the AirThings, this makes sense as I have been in an on-again, off-again remodel on this house and have a bunch of new stuff in the place. I also had some just-starting mold, but that's been carefully demoed (bathrooms) and a remediation spray was applied so I think I am good there. Both bathrooms have water damage from the previous owner - not a good steward of the place. The subfloors will be replaced, TBD on some of the studs.

The Dyson has shown me that there is a VOC spike once a day. usually in the early morning - 2/3 am.

I've eliminate scented detergents/cleaning agents, my plan is to bring in additional house plants, keep running the Dyson, and remove all plastics to see if Off-gassing is the issue.

Any other thoughts?

VOC increase at certain times,"I don't want to go into my living situation or my life situation too much, but I was worried that my roommates might not like me and I started smelling burnt like smells.  I didn't want to act paranoid and make any acquisitions, so I just said it was something normal.

But I recently bought an Amazon Air Quality monitor.  At first, it seemed pretty normal.  But than the VOC content would increase.  

Once again, I did not want to be seen as a crazy person.  So I assumed it was normal.  But I kept tracking.

Today is when it seemed more worrying.  I work from home and sleep a little later but they go to work both at 6:30.  Just at that time, the VOC slowly increased and stayed at a high level until 8:30.  I only saw this after the fact, as i was still asleep.  I felt really shitty today too.  Brain fog and dizziness. 

I don't want to say they are trying to poison me but maybe trying to get me to leave because they don't like me.  I don't know, but i wanted to see if this was normal.

From Aranet 
What is a normal CO2 concentration? 
A normal CO2 concentration is about 400 ppm outdoors. Inside a well-ventilated building, normal CO2 levels range from 400-1000 ppm.  
When the saturation of CO2 is greater than 1000 ppm, people start to experience drowsiness. Levels above 2000 ppm are associated with sleepiness, headaches, and other unpleasant side effects.6

ERV Hack - Ductless $650,"Long story short. I was looking for an affordable way to reduce C02 at home.  CO2 was always above 1700. Homes in Florida are tightly sealed and insurlated due to humidity levels. I tried cracking windows for over a month but had my HVAC struggle to keep up with south Florida humidity. In the cooler months it was fine. 

Naturally I began researching ERV units. Wanted to go with a broan AI system but unfortunately HVAC companies in SOFLO seem to have no idea what an ERV is or have no interest in installing them. They just want to sell scrubbers and blue lights. 
I also read on some other forums that I would be looking at over 6-7 K. Which I would be willing to pay if I could. But it was out of my budget. 

So I started looking into system like Panasonic whisper quiet and other single room ERVS. (I am using to dilute air for the entire home)

Well finally I landed on a unit I could find almost nothing about online. It’s a pioneer ECOASIS150 ERV

Video on unit from Holtop
https://youtu.be/NbUqV5HHevY

This unit is made by a Chinese company called Holtop 
 Holtop supplies OEM products for Midea, LG, Hitachi, McQuay, York, Trane and Carrier. At least that’s what they claim. The one I bought seems to imported and branded by Pioneer mini splits. 

This unit is intended to be installed on an interior  wall with one exhaust pipe and one inlet pipe. Of course that would require for me to drill 2 4” cores out of my concrete walls so since I wasn’t ready to commit to this unit just yet and was a bit skeptical I opted for an AC style installation. Intaking and exhausting from a window.

Claims to have 100 CFM and runs on 35 watts at max speed. 

Unit has 8 speeds and inlet and outlet motor can be controlled independently via an app or on touch interface for pressure equalization issues. 

Here are the claimed specs for the unit. 

Model	ERVQ-B150-1A1
Airflow (m3/h)	150
Filtration efficiency (%)	99% HEPA
Filtration mode	Pm2.5 purify / Deep purify / Ultra purify
Speed	DC / 8 speed
Input power (W)	35
Temperature efficiency (%)	82
Noise dB(A)	23 – 36
Control	Touch screen panel / Remote control
Air quality display	PM2.5 / Temp & R.H
Operational Mode	Manual / Auto / Timer
Suitable room size (m2)	20 – 45
Dimension (mm)	450*155*660
Weight (kg)	10

I am planning on running some test to measure true air flow and DB

I’ve only had it running for 2 days and it has had a significant improvement on CO2 levels. 

My CO2 levels are normally climbing at 9am reaching up 1800 but as you can see from my air things wave it’s leveling out at around 916. Still not great CO2 levels but a huge improvement considering it’s a a single room unit. Btw I have an Aranet and the wave on opposite ends of the room to get the best reading possible. Far from the ERV. 

Well in any case I know this was long and drawn out. 
I know this unit is not a premium unit per say so I can’t speak on its longevity however build quality seems to be pretty good and has a ton of features like
WiFi connectivity 

App controller 

Touch screen panel. 

IR controller 

CO2 sensor. (Trying to get specifics from manf)

PM 2.5 Sensor 

Simple install. If you rig it like I did or mount it. 

Brushless motors 

Quiet operation. 

If you are interested in more information or details or want to see the how the unit continues to perform I can continue to post. I am mainly putting this out there since it seems like good air quality is mostly out of reach for most ppl from a $$ or install standpoint. 
Maybe others will see this and explore their own setup.",38,2024-04-01 16:06:33
High VOC and CO2 levels after hot shower?,"As soon as I turn on the shower in my master bathroom, the **VOC** and **CO2** levels on my Mila HEPA filter in my master bedroom go crazy. See attached. Why would this be? 

I take a 25 minute hot shower and CO2 levels start rising one minute after I turn the shower on and peak 15-20 minutes into my shower around **1200ppm**. CO2 levels in my master bedroom average 450ppm so this is going almost triple. I read that 1400ppm can cause a 50% reduction in cognitive function, so it has me concerned, even if these levels are short-lived. I read that mold consumes oxygen and gives off CO2, but if there is any mold in my bathroom it's certainly not visible.

Same story with the VOC level. Starts rising immediately after I turn on the shower, peaks 15-20 min in at around **1500ppb**; normal levels in my master bedroom average 50ppb — 30x increase from a hot shower. 

Exhaust fan runs entire time shower is on and for 15-30 minutes afterwards. I don’t use any crazy harsh hair or body care products in the shower. Dove soap, Body Shop body gel, Olaplex shampoo.

Carbon/Merv Air Scrubber Solution!,"Long story... Decided that most APs suck (literally). I wanted something that could clean the air not just of dust/pet dander or pollen etc but VOCs. I do 3D printing in my workspace/bedroom so wanted a clean air space but normal AP wont do & we dont know about VOCs from printing long term. There are a few studies about different filament materials & some that i use are ""safe/harmless"" but science/ testing changes over time so that maybe not the case in 5 years. I just want to ""Air"" on the side of caution & be safer than sorry! Off the shelf solutions in the UK there was only 1 really the IQAir multigas.
Decided using ACInfinity this would be the better way. Building it like this Carbon canister > inline Fan
> duct box with Merv filter. So its carbon first which the fan sucks up through itself, fan then blows through the merv filter and boom clean air.
I spec'd this for overkill solution as this space is 54m3 & the fan can cover around 1371m3/hr. lets take 25% off that for the air restriction reduction of whats strapped to it. Works out to be 1028.25m3 on max speed & there are a total 10 speed levels, so i have lots of room to place with for how clean i want the room and how many air changes. On speed level 1 it's quieter than my Blue Air & will be much better!
Will probs move it or maybe leave it there depending on how it does and tidy up cables!
8 inch carbon canister holds around 16lbs of carbon and its refillable, 8 inch pro EC fan & 8 inch duct box with a 14x20x1 merv filter & some noise clamps (other sizes of merv will fit) also got the smart 69 BT (ayyy) controller which also has a temp/humidity probe and can change the speed depending on either or both of those stats & can also control it from my phone via the app or the controller unit, they also have a wireless remote i could get. Can Set a timer for how long it's on/off for etc. this solution has come to around 54% of the price if a GC multigas & also the merv filters/carbon refill cost less (came with extra 1 x 16lbs of carbon to refill)

Managing VOCs without carbon,"Hi all,

I have an illness that is putting a lot of pressure on my detox systems (aldehydes specifically) - and although I always was ok in my room before; now it is contributing to negative symptoms of intoxication.  

For reasons I won't go into here; I can't simply move - for the time being I am stuck here.  

On some days my aldehyde load for other reasons is high enough that I am having symptoms regardless of where I am, even if I wear a mask etc.  

However on other days, I am clearly just coping with the load from other sources; and can be crystal clear of symptoms outside the room - but on those days being in my room pushes me over the line into toxic symptoms - and if I leave the room or mask up, I clear up.  

Of course the most obvious thing to do is get an air purifier which removes VOCs.  
Unfortunately the very same illness that is making me sensitive to aldehydes also makes me intolerant to carbon filters.  

I've tried coconut carbon, bamboo carbon, pine carbon. They all cause me intolerable symptoms.  

So... once carbon filtering is out; I am struggling to find other ways I can make this situation more tolerable for myself until I can find a way out beyond just masking which is frankly intolerable over an extended period in hot weather.  

Any suggestions anyone has would be greatly appreciated.

Anyway my computers start running their fans at full speed constantly, every 3-5 months because they're plugged with dust.This systemic cleaning has been an annual, or less issue at every other place I've lived.

I'd like to add two particulate level sensors to my network for interior and exterior levels.  
These can be USB, Serial, Ethernet, WiFi, or bluetooth. Regardless my main goal for the entire network is to not rely on external servers, so if possible I'm looking for a finished product which fills these requirements, otherwise I'll look into configuring a circuit around the appropriate bare sensor components.

Recommendations for an air purifier ,"Hey guys. My house is CONSTANTLY being layered with dust. I sweep and mop every other day, and dust almost every day. No matter how much I clean, guaranteed the next day there will be a noticeable layer of dust on all of my furniture. My house is all hardwood floor, and I have 2 golden retriever’s which is safe to assume where most of the dust is coming from due to me living in WA, it’s always wet/muddy outside and when they come inside, they track the mud in. Any advice on what I should do or purchase to fix this issue? The dust is going to drive me clinically insane. Thank you in advance. Save me. ",5,2024-03-14 07:14:01
Any alternative to ERV or opening windows ?," 
hey air quality folks. I’m getting ready to give up. So I have reported on here before that my CO2 levels are constantly above 1700. I took the advice from this awesome group and opened up some windows. This was working great keeping levels below1000 throughout the day but unfortunately proved to be too much humidity for my hvac to handle causing several issues. 
Now I am forced to close the windows due to the high levels of humidity in south Florida but my CO2 levels are high again. Other than purchasing and installing an ERV are there other more cost effective solutions. 
Can I install an extractor in my attic will this with the HVAC pulling in fresh air help ? Appreciate any advice. Not sure if this is even worth it at this point.

Looking for help working out the air quality for my local climbing wall.,"Hi all, hopefully you can help, I work for a climbing gym and I'm trying to work out our dust exposure. 

We have this little monitor but struggling to convert the data it gives me into something I can understand

The workplace HSE limits are: 4mg/m3 for respirable dust and 10mg/m3 inhalable. 8hour weighted average 

From what I have gathered for respirable that's anything under pm10? 

I can't export any data directly from the device as far as I can tell so I'll just have to look at it to with things out and put data into a spreadsheet. 

If I'm right, currently it's at around 5.8mg/m3?

I'm going to put this data into a spreadsheet by hour
And then average it out over the days and weeks. 

Does this look accurate to you guys or will I have to work things out some other way?

Most efficient way to remove CO2 from house without losing too much cool air or adding too much humidity?,"Hello! Been monitoring my house co2 for the past few months, it's been pretty easy to regulate during the cooler months but now that it's getting warm I'm wondering what the most efficient way to flush the house out is?



For some context, I live in South Florida so it's hot and very humid outside. I do have AC, but don't want to overuse it if possible.



My plan is to once a day open a door and place a strong fan across the floor to hopefully push the co2 out (co2 is heavier than air right?). Is this the best way to remove co2 from the house in the shortest amount of time & adding the least amount of humidity to the house? I'm also planning to buy a dehumidifier to run after doing this, if you think that will help.

Headaches in new apartment,"Hi all, 

I recently moved into a pre-war building and I'm having headaches nearly everyday.  There is a really musty smell in the building itself which I chalked up to it being very old; however, I also smell it primarily in my hallway--seems like it's probably seeping in from the front door.  

I've had all my windows open, air purifiers running, put out vinegar, bowls of baking soda, and have candles and incense going, but I can still smell it.  I checked behind the radiator and under the sink for signs of mold/leaks, but I don't see anything.  There's some wear and tear, but nothing that looks obviously like mold or water damage.  I bought an air testing kit which showed normal levels of CO2 and VOCs.  It did show the humidity is a bit high (roughly 52), so I am waiting on a dehumidifier to arrive.

I'm really unsure what's causing the headaches as well.  It looks like the floors were recently varnished and the walls repainted.  The windows were all closed prior to me moving in--could it be the fumes from that?

I'm not sure what else to do though.  I just moved and this is literally a dream home besides this smell and the headaches I'm getting.  I asked the super but he seemed somewhat oblivious (maybe he's used to the smell) and I reached out to the landlord, but haven't heard back yet.  I'm not even sure what I should ask them to do or look for??

Any advice appreciated!",6,2024-02-28 14:40:39

EV incentive program emissions reductions impact calculation,"I recently started a new position in my state environmental department working with air policy in different capacity. A big program I’m a part of and being introduced to is the incentive program we have to help state residents purchase electric vehicles. It’s for both new, leased and used EVs. We also have programs within for incentives for eBikes, we’re going to open it up to businesses and such. There’s many levels to the program than just a rebate for state residents. 

Anyways. We have to start working on a report to go back to state government to show the programs impact. Specifically on the environmental justice communities in the state and communities burdened more so with air pollution than others. I’m a math person and this program does have a lot of data. I have been looking around for a set of equations or some kind of calculating tool or just….something where I can plug in some data and eventually calculate how much emissions (CO2, NOx, whatever kind) this program has been able to reduce by the number of electric vehicles purchased through the program. Yes, there are equations out there to help calculate individual emissions reductions but I’m looking to try and find a number at a state-wide level and it seems like this hasn’t really been done before.

So far, I have tried researching for other states or programs who might have done this already to see their methodology but I haven’t been able to come across anything. I’ve also tried using some online calculators created by research groups like the [EV Incentive Cost and Impact Tool](https://trec-pdx.shinyapps.io/incentive-impact-tool/) but the answers are always too broad. I’m really looking to generate a solid answer based on the data from my states’ program. The most promising thing I might have found so far is the set of equations in section 3.1 in [The eBike Potential: Estimating regional eBike impacts on ghg emissions](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10218774) but it’s for eBikes and I’m waiting to talk to another department to possibly get this but we currently don’t have the data for the variable of the length of the average trip. 

Does anyone have any suggestions? Any equation systems you might know of? Any kind of calculators already out there that might be able to help? I’m not looking for general answers but I’m trying to get a more specific, narrow answer on what kind of emissions reductions we have seen so far. Anything might help!!

Confused by sudden PM 2.5 spikes once per day.,"I have an Airthings View Plus monitor. I also have 4 Medify Air MA-40 air purifiers in my apartment, each outfitted with HEPA 13 filters that get replaced regularly. Despite this, I notice very specific and sharp spikes in my Air Quality readings that I can't figure out the source of. For context, I live in a 1000 Square Foot apartment, on the 9th floor. My building has some pretty shitty ventilation and no air conditioning, which is what led me to get this many air purifiers for cleaner air. Most of the time, my Air Quality seems relatively good, thanks to the air purifiers. I'll have several hours of 0 to 3 for PM 2.5 readings, maybe a weird half hour or so where it rises to 8 or 10 or so. Nothing too bad. But then, once every day or two, I get a weird spike out of nowhere that lasts for about an hour, where it will shoot up to anywhere from 35 to 83 and last that way for an hour or so before slowly falling back down.   


In these instances, the air purifiers don't seem to help bring it down, but opening a window will cause them to start to fall quicker/stop rising.   


Does anyone know what the source of these spikes could be? I noticed last time it happened (PM 2.5 reached 81) my PM 1 levels also rose to 36.

1 bedroom apartment in San Francisco.

Ventilation
- Window in living room
- Balcony door in living room
- Window in bedroom
- Vent in living room to outside
- Exhaust fan in bathroom — cannot be manually controlled, only by humidity detector
- Exhaust fan above kitchen stove

Notes:
- 18 month old building, only 1 tenant prior
- Paint is speedhide interior (acrylic latex)
- Real hardwood flooring (not sure of bathroom flooring)
- Bedroom is carpeted with a rougher material
- Airthings reports normal on all levels. Ocassionally VOC and CO2 spike to slightly over good. PM2.5 spikes when shower is on
- Faces very busy road at all hours (bus frequents it too)
- West facing windows
- Radiant floor heating
- Mid level floor
- Water is chlorinated I think? Has a white pigment if you fill it in a glass. I only drink it after filtering

Problems:
- If I close the windows and balcony door, the temperature shoots up to 73-75 degrees very quickly. 
- Bathroom smells like wet paint and feels burning on the eyes and nostrils (for me and some others but it’s inconsistent)
- I wake up with burning red eyes
- Occasional dizziness
- Ants crawling in and out of bathroom drains. Silverfish showed up recently too.
- Anxiety attacks
- Bad joint paint (possibly due to poor sleep because of this?)
- Tiny flies circling living room and flying around entire unit.

What I’ve tried:
- Vacuuming/Mopping/Cleaning/Washing
- Professional Deep Cleaning
- Vent Fan installed by handyman
- Blackout curtains
- Air purifiers everywhere. Humidifier. Air circulators.
- Different bulbs (Philips hue!)
- Closing bathroom door
- Daily eyedrops, allergy medications
- Airthings in Living Room and Bathroom
- Keeping windows and balcony open all night (made sleeping hard)
- Fan pointed outside, fan pointed inside, fan pointed to move airflow between them
- Removing possible allergens (sheets, mattress pad, foods)
- Not using my bathroom and using another one in the building
- Staying at other places (hotels, friends) to see if problem goes away (it does, after a few hours of being outside)
- N95 mask. P95 respirator. Goggles.

Currently doing:
- Awaiting city inspection
- Eyedrops prescribed by doctor
- Allergen testing from doctor (awaiting results)
- Using bathroom outside my unit.
- Wearing respirator & goggles when entering bathroom.
- Avoiding cooking inside.


What could be causing these problems for me? I feel like I’ve tried everything at this point. I’m desperately hoping the city can figure it out, but they are very slow.",5,2024-02-08 10:53:38

[Help] Indoor Air Quality for dummies,"Hi fellow redditors, I have recently settled in a cozy apartment in polluted Bologna, Italy. 

Not knowing anything about air quality, except that here is rather bad, I am now embarking on a journey which I'd like to document from start to finish.

I will describe my situation, my plans and my questions and hopefully over discussions and your help I can turn this into a proper guide.

Here's my situation:

- Apartment in the city center of Bologna, close to the train station (heavy traffic), on a 3rd floor (0 is ground level) of a 7 floors building. All my Windows face the inside of the building which is a sort of small courtyard.
- Apartment is 90m² ish (2x Bedrooms, 1x Bathroom a 1x Kitchen+living+study+corridor). One large window per room.
- In the apartment there's me and my partner. We both work from home.
- We have a basic AC setup with just cold air and humidifier while the heating (via radiators) is centralized. In the future I plan on upgrading my AC but for the moment is rather basic.
- Cleaning wise we have an Ecovac Omni for vacuuming and mopping with a basic cordless Hoover for cleaning the spots the Ecovac doesn't reach. 
- No pets other than a ball python, 2 hognose and a terrarium with mourning geckos (partners like reptiles). A cat might be in the future (if and when it happens I will probably by a HEPA filter vacuum)
- No gas at all, everything in the house is electric/induction
- We don't smoke but we like to burn incense (usually decent quality japanese ones, which means much less smoke than normal incense)

Here's my basic plan

- Start monitoring outside air via IQAIR to optimize venting fresh air in
- get one air purifier for each room (maybe skimp the bathroom)
- get decent air quality monitors to monitor indoor quality. I would like one for each room.
- eventually upgrade to proper HVAC

In terms of metrics:
- CO2 (especially for bedrooms during the night)
- VOC (although it seems that it might get false positive on cooking etc...)
- Particulate (this I am more worried about since it should be the main driver of pollution for the area)
- I don't think Radon should be a concern since I am on the 3rd floor but you tell me.

I am programmer and I am rolling my own home automation and automating air quality management would be amazing. So:

- Automated notification on outdoor quality to determine when to areate with outside air
- Automate reporting and analysis of Air Quality sensors (so my ideal sensors should be compatible with Home Assistant)
- Automate air purifiers based of the above two data sources

Hardware wise it seems that in terms of off-the-shelf monitors the ones that reliably came across are:

- IQAir AirVisual
- Airthing view
- Awair element 
- Rolling my own via diy (while I can likely assemble and program it, I have no idea where to start sensor-wise)
- Air Gradient 

For Air Purifiers the story seems much more varied (at least in my research) with some articles even suggesting that diy options are much better (and much cheaper) than even top of the line products.

So my questions:

- Have I forgotten any aspects?
- Is the plan sound?
- Which Air monitor and purifier should I look more into? 
- Should I go with off-the-shelf or try the diy route?
- Any good guides/research/literature whatever that I should look into?",5,2024-02-07 07:14:27
Variability of Outdoor PM2.5 Readings,"Hello, quick question for anyone who can give a science-y explanation. I live in the upper Midwest (United States). In the summer, I made it a habit to check AQI after our area was frequently affected by smoke from the Canadian/western wildfires. Now that it's winter, we still have stretches where AQI is higher than I'd expect, especially on foggy or very humid days. This seems to be more noticeable on low cost PM2.5 sensors, less so on permanent (better? more expensive?) sensors. 

So my questions... Does very high humidity/fog cause actual elevations in PM 2.5, or is it an artificial elevation/false positive? And are low cost sensors more likely to be affected? 

Please point me in the right direction if I'm barking up the wrong tree. Thanks!",4,2024-02-06 18:24:06

What do I do about possible air freshener that has gotten into central heating?,"I live in a townhouse and have neighbors on both sides of my unit. I have two bathrooms. On one side, the neighbor's townhouse is configured exactly like mine is only in a mirror image so their bathrooms are right next to mine.
 
Whenever I would go in my bathrooms there was a strong smell of what I am assuming is air freshener. I have read that air fresheners contain dozens of toxic chemicals. I'd noticed that when I would use the bathroom I'd get shortness of breath, a headache, worse tinnitus and throat irritation.  

Since it's been cold I have had to use the heat on and unfortunately air freshener has gotten into the vents in the bathrooms and has now circulated the smell - and potentially all of these toxic chemicals - all throughout the townhouse. It's now not just in the bathroom, but in the rest of the townhouse as well. I am reacting to it no matter where I go since it has probably been circulating throughout all the rooms.

Any reason why VOCs in my house spike like this?,"Started using an Airthings Wave Plus about two weeks ago, and have had random VOC spikes between 700-1000 ppb around 7-9PM some nights. The house I live in used to be owned by a former smoker so I understand there is a higher chance of reading high VOCs, but before moving in every wall/surface was TSP’ed and cleaned, air ducts professionally cleaned, installed a new furnace with a UV light, and I have a Levoit air purifier running constantly. Any smell of a former smoker here is pretty much gone, and most of the day the VOC level sits between 50-225 ppb which is fine by me. 

Besides sometimes cooking dinner (on an electric stove so no gas) I don’t do anything different between these hours where it spikes than when I’m working at home throughout the day in the same room. Any idea what could be causing these spikes?",6,2024-02-02 02:34:57

How to get reliable data on pollen counts?,"My question is 3-fold.

Background: Our dog is very allergic to many types of pollen, so we are interested in knowing what the daily pollen count is in our area before exposing him. We have looked at various sites like [pollen.com](https://pollen.com), [weatherchannel.com](https://weatherchannel.com) etc but they often give very different results.

Q1. Is there a reliable site that you would recommend for accurate pollen counts?

Q2. Is there any way we can get a more detailed pollen count about what *type* of pollen is prevalent? For example, our dog is very allergic to ragweed but not juniper.

Q3. Is there an exterior air quality device that you would recommend that would give us accurate pollen counts?",4,2024-01-29 16:40:36

Child’s school near busy street with plenty of traffic.,"Hi everyone!

My daughter (5) has asthma. She currently goes to a really good private school BUT this school is around 50 feet near a busy road with alot of stop and go traffic. 

Cars don’t speed up in this area, more on stop and go traffic. We live in Southeast Asia. Diesel vehicles are rampant here. 

I am really worried about air quality in her school since she will be first grade on the next school year and would be in school for 8 hours. 

Should I move her to a different school with less car traffic? Her current school as air conditioning with closed windows, would that lessen pollution?

Why don't hundreds of millions people die of air pollution?,"Ok first this is not a joke or troll question. I am really curious about this. 

So I live in a city of 10M+ people where the average AQI is 150. I am quite paranoid about air pollution so I have the expensive brand name air purifiers in my house, cars and office. However, something does not make sense to me. 

Everyday, I see thousands of people commuting to work on motorcycles. Traffic jam is quite bad in my city. This means these people are inhaling vehicle exhaust for at least 2-3 hours per day consistently. There are even millions of people working as delivery drivers and streetside vendors which means they are inhaling vehicle exhausts consistently all day every day. I see the same thing on some other cities too like cities in India, China, etc. So my conclusion is there are at least hundreds of million people inhaling REALLY BAD air pollution consistently in the world.

Why are there not mass deaths or illness happening to these hundreds of million people? Is air pollution not as dangerous as we thought?",9,2024-01-26 05:03:55

Extremely High and Unexplainable TVOC levels,"Edit: Guess I could have saved myself a sleepless night if I just googled Awair Element problems. Looks like a lot of people are seeing crazy VOC reading lately.

Sorry if this post is a little incoherent, I barely slept last night. For the past few days, my Awair Element indoor air monitor has been reading exceptionally high VOC levels. It's almost always at the baseline or near it (except when cooking), but it's been reading close to 2000 ppb at some points in the past few days, and basically always over 500. If I look at the history since last Thursday, I can see more and more frequent periods of very high VOCs.

Some details:
- I can't smell anything abnormal.
- Ive had a sore throat the past couple days, which I can't say for certain isn't caused by VOC exposure.
- I don't believe the sensor is malfunctioning. Placing it at an open window reads very little VOCs and placing it in my building's hallway reads low VOCs.
- Opening a window massively reduces them, but they rebound in an hour. 
- Theres nothing about my small apartment that's changed.
- I own a 3D printer that does emit VOCs, but it's been in a grow tent with direct outside ventilation for a year now with no issues. I've spent the past day trying constantly to find a cause, so I put all of my 3D printing stuff in large Ziploc bags, but this has had no impact.
- My building sent an email last week saying they were changing air filters. I don't know if mine was actually changed, they were scheduled to come when I was at work on Thursday. I don't know how an air filter could create such massive quantities of VOCs, but it's the only significant change in the environment.

I really, really need some advice on what to do. It's below freezing outside right now but I still have to sit next to an open window because I'm afraid of more exposure. I have a respirator I've been wearing while I test stuff, but it's incredibly uncomfortable to wear for extended periods.",6,2024-01-19 17:19:49
Ventless Dryers (Condenser and Heat pump type) VOCs,"Thought I would ask since I have not found any discussion or comments on this particular topic and it's bothering me a bit. It's about Ventless Dryers, both the Condenser and heatpump type.

There has been studies on vented dryers producting VOCs both from the detergents, dryer sheets, or the clothing themselves being heated. For a vented dryer it gets pumped outside so other than polluting the neighborhood it shouldn't affect the house itself.

Somehow none of the heatpump or condenser discussions/threads mention this.

Am I the only one curious about where the VOCs will go in the ventless dryers?

If ventless dryers still vent inside, wouldn't the VOCs collect in the room the dryer is in? and if the ventless dryer is completely sealed, its' not magical, the VOCs and pollutants are still inside the drum and will be released when you open the door to retrieve the dried laundry?

I get that the whole point of ventless is efficiency, you aren't blowing conditioned air out of the building but all that recycled air will be adding VOCs to the house? For regular gas/electric dryers there are advices to NOT vent indoors, yet here we are venting VOCs back inside the house for ventless dryers? It doesn't make sense to me. VOCs cannot even be filtered by HEPA and you need activated carbon filters, does ventless dryers have these?

This might be a bit of a conspiracy theory or are the manufacturers/government hiding this from us? Heat pump dryers are a relatively new tech. Would there be reports 10 years down the road once the heat pump dryers get more popular and the reports of people getting cancer start to surface? If people start to look into this is it going to kill the billions dollars heatpump dryer industry?

"If you run an AC unit and an Air Purifier at the same time, can you safely use AC with poor air quality?","I have a single-hose AC unit that only has basic screen filters - for large debris and dust. Last summer, we could barely run it due to the overwhelming amount of smoke that blew into our area (avg. quality of 100-150 on IQAir). So this year, we bought a honeywell 2000 sqft Air Purifier with approved HEPA filters and an allergen filter.   


If the AC and the Air Purifier were both used at the same time, in an isolated room, would it be safe to run them both at the same time? or would the amount of smoke being pulled in be way too much for the separate air purifier to handle?   


for context on why this matters - we have a bird, and birds have notriously sensitive lungs. At the same time, we have an apartment that reaches well above 30C  in the summer if we don't use AC. ",5,2024-01-15 06:48:39
Any air filters that easily fit open windows and/or transom fan?,"Hey all,

I've used air purifiers for years, and recently purchased a CO2 meter.  It's been illuminating-- CO2 levels are \*way\* higher than I would have guessed, and so as a result I've been opening the windows.

The problem of course is that living in a city, the ""fresh air"" isn't so fresh and I'm concerned about the particulates/ pollution, and wondering running the purifier is a waste with the window cracked. I don't have a PM2.5 monitor but am planning on getting one so I can better assess.

Does anyone have a set-up to bring in filtered fresh air? I'm not talking things like an ERV that would involve renovation.  Like has anyone successfully attached a filter to a transom window fan, or is there a window filter that works decently?

Sensibo Elements Experience,"TLDR: I would not recommend them

Almost 2 months ago, I decided to buy a sensibo elements air quality monitor. There are a number of sketchy things about the experience and the monitor that I thought I would share. 

Sketchy Thing 1:
First off, it was drop shipped from Hong Kong. I was excited to get it set up and it was only after I was putting the box back together that I noticed it had those dot sealing stickers, and the ones on my box had already been cut. 
Oh well, it was already set up, registered and seemed to be working. So it was a bit late to complain about that. 

Sketchy Thing 2:
The PM2.5 reading is only useful as a very rough indication. Most of the time it said it was 0.1 ug/m3. I later got an Atmotube and when that was reading 5ug/m3 right next to the Sensibo, the Sensibo was still only reading 0.1. 

Sketchy Thing 3:
When I raised that with Sensibo support, they claimed it was working as expected. They claimed that comparing to external sensors was not useful because of ""different sensor types, locations, and particle compositions"" and that changes weren't being registered because ""it relies on particles passing through the sensor itself.""
Uhmm... Ok... 🤦‍♀️
Their solution over several emails was power cycling, resetting the device, and reconnecting it to the wifi. 🤷🏻‍♀️

Sketchy Thing 4:
After a bit of back and forth, I managed to get them to give a refund. I got a notice that the refund has been processed. A day later, and I haven't seen it come through on my card yet. I'll give them another 48hrs before I follow up with my card provider. The sketchy part is that they then said that the device has now been deactivated remotely and that I don't need to return it and can dispose of it as e-waste. 
To me, that's a sign that the product is ridiculously cheap (overpriced to the consumer) that they don't even need it sent back. 

Sketchy Tech Stuff:
Given that I've apparently been given a refund and can dispose of the product, I took it apart. 

The PM sensor is an IR based sensor: Winsen ZPH04B. The datasheet lists the consistency as +/- 25% or +/- 25 ug/m3. 
For comparison, the Plantower pms5003 laser sensor is +/-10%

The gas sensor is the ZMOD4410 which measures TVOC and then estimates CO2. Interestingly, the Sensibo app also has a reading for ethanol, which i imagine must be derived/estimated also. 

The temp/humidity sensor is the HDC1080. That's a pretty standard piece.",13,2024-01-12 12:00:07

Sore throat when heat is on,"Sore throats when heat is on

Wife and I are getting sore throats when heat is on the get so bad we get green phlegm. We left for the holidays for two weeks and we were fine. We come back, she has a sore throat and cough within a week. She had allergy testing and she’s not allergic to anything.  Sometimes even when cooling is on. If we have a humidifier on, it lowers the chances but not entirely. 
We moved into a brand new house in March of this year. We had an engineer map out our hvac ductwork. We also have a UV scrubber, fresh air intake that we thought would help with the problem, but it didn’t. 

We had a profession mold test and there was no source for mold. They did detect some levels of Penicillium/Aspergillus matching the outside levels. We had windows open that day. We have air doctors in every room and exhaust fans in every bathroom. 

We looked for water leaks everywhere, the mold testing company ran the water and went around with thermal imaging. I also have a flume that tracks water usage at the meter and haven’t seen any unintended water usage. 

It’s becoming an issue, my wife is convinced it’s the fact that we have a furnace and not a heat pump. The air blowing was too hot, almost like standing by an oven. So we had the hvac guy turn up the blower and lower the flame as low as possible.  

Short of switch to a dual fuel with a heat pump, we have no other options but to sell this house we built. 

We don’t have foam insulation. We have cellulose, the house is airtight. 

I’ve looked in the duct work with a snake camera to look for dirt/dust/construction debris and mold. Can’t see anything. Worth noting that the duct system was sealed until we moved in. 

I tested for air leaks with a smoke pen to see if the system is pulling air out of the walls or attic through light cans and reciprocal, nothing. 

I did formaldehyde testing and nothing was detected. 

If we turn off the system. Nose Stuffiness goes away and throat is not irritated.

CO2 - is 300ppm a meaningful difference?,"Hey folks, ran a bit of an experiment this holiday season without really meaning to:

💡 **Hypothesis: First Class flight passengers enjoy lower CO2 intake compared to Economy passengers.**

**Background:**

I live in DC, family lives in California. I flew home for Christmas on Dec 20, but one of my family members tested positive for covid 3 days after I arrived (Dec 23) so I bought a last minute ticket back to my home in DC on the 25th. I could've flown out the evening of the 23rd, but my goal was to avoid the last-minute travel crowds. I figured the 25th would be the least popular travel day. Had to balance whether it was riskier to stay with family, one of whom was infectious, or risk mingling in some of the most dense airport and airplane crowds of the year where undoubtedly there'd also be many infectious travelers.

The flight I took back home to DC was essentially the exact same flight as the one I took to CA, just a different time of day, and instead of economy I flew first class. Just before this trip I was messaging with a friend who was telling me she thought first class might be safer because the seating is more spread out, so there's less shared air. I didn't really buy that because it's not like the economy cabin air can't mix with first class, plus viruses don't bias against which seat you choose (though someone with the means to fly first class likely also has other layers of protection that keep them healthier, like paid sick leave, job that lets them WFH, etc). Anyway, I had my Aranet4 with me for this DC <> CA trip, and here's what I found:

✈️ **DC → CA**

* Plane: Boeing 777-200ER
   * Passenger capacity: a smidge over 360
   * Full flight
* Seat: 47E
* Flight duration: 5 hours 10 minutes
   * Direct flight. No layovers.
   * No delays, no sitting on the tarmac at departure location or final destination
* Average CO2 output for the flight: 1536
* Highest CO2 reading during the flight: 1867
* Lowest CO2 reading during the flight: 873

✈️ **CA → DC**

* Plane: Boeing 777-200ER
   * Passenger capacity: a smidge over 360

* Seat: 1A

   * Direct flight. No layovers.

* Average CO2 output for the flight: 1235
* Highest CO2 reading during the flight: 1346
* Lowest CO2 reading during the flight: 858

❓ **Question: is 300ppm a meaningful difference in CO2?**

The difference between the CO2 averages for each flight is almost 300ppm exactly. And that's where my question above comes in: how meaningful is 300ppm in these ranges of CO2?

HRV and dehumidistat,"Hi,

I'm not sure in which subreddit I should ask but I'll try here. My HRV has a humidistat and I'm wondering if it's working well.

I can select the humidity percentage I want but it doesn't seem to work. No matter what I set, it just remove humidity non-stop from the house. For example, I start it yesterday evening (with settings at 50%) and forgot to stop it before going to sleep.

We woke up with the whole house at around 25% humidity and coughing because of dry air. The more it runs, the drier the air becomes. 

Could it be a problem with the humidistat? Any other idea?  Note that my HRV is very basic. No recirculation or timer. It's ON (with a %) or off.

VOCs coming thru single HVAC air duct?,"We have high VOCs upstairs. I live in a brownstone, 3 floors. I isolated the VOCs to the upstairs bathroom.

New apartment next to an oil refinery. Should I be worried about VOCs?,"I recently moved to a new apartment which I discovered is close to an oil refinery. I've heard that oil refineries emit a lot of VOCs which can be terrible for your health, so I'm hoping to understand how worried I should be.  
I managed to find some [information on the emissions of this particular refinery](https://utslappisiffror.naturvardsverket.se/en/Search/Plant-page/?pid=4089). In 2022, it emitted 112,477,000 kg of CO2, 438,000 kg of NMVOC, 36,000 kg of NOx/NO2, and 74,900 kg of SO2 into the air.

Toxic air in our new home,"Toxic air in new home

Wondering if anyone has experienced anything similar as we are running out of options. We recently bought a house and moved in with our one year old. (My significant other, baby, dog and myself). Since moving in, there is an extreme spike in air quality that makes me very sick that we can’t figure out. It seems to only affect me and not my significant other. I notice some differences in our baby but if it is from this, it’s nothing like what I experience, although his could be explained just by being a one year old. Heres what I know: 
1. It seems to be heat related although we have had every test on our heater and all have said no leaks and in great condition. 
2. We had our ducts cleaned and sanitized. 
3. There was no gas leak detected, or carbon monoxide. 
4. It is hard to pin point an exact timing on it but it does happen more frequently at night. Some days it happens a couple times a day, sometimes it doesn’t happen at all. 
5. when the “event” happens - my symptoms include tight chest, hard to breathe, brain fog and confusion and headache. 
6. The event doesn’t last very long and when whatever is happened stops I get better (I’m total I think it lasts about 15 min from start to my feeling better) 
7. When the event happens there is an extreme spike in the vocs in our home according to a few different brands of air quality monitors we have purchased. 
8. Up until the last couple days I didn’t have access to the air quality numbers, I just could tell because my body would start reacting and then we would look it up and sure enough it had spiked. 
9. We had not cooked or done laundry, cleaned with anything besides soap, or done anything that should cause such a spike. We were fearing a leak at first so we hadn’t been doing much in the home and staying at a hotel. 
10. We are waiting on an extended mold test but there isn’t any obvious mold and the timing of the spikes being so random really doesn’t make me confident in any mold theory.
Any thoughts are so appreciated. Needing to keep our baby safe.",24,2023-12-04 03:14:19

There are 4 types of humidifiers,"Note: These were written from the context of portable humidifiers, but I think HVAC humidifiers work on the same underlying principles (primarily, steam or evaporation).

(4th type, impeller, is very hard to find now)

* 3 typically produce a ""cool mist"", but can have a heater
   * ultrasonic (most popular with many brands and models)
      * works by high frequency ultrasonic vibrations of a surface under water. 
      * requires water low in minerals to prevent production of white dust and pm2.5 (0 TDS is best)
      * cannot use tap water (must be reverse osmosis, deionized, or best: distilled)
   * impeller (Vicks 4100, limited availability online) 
      * works by high speed rotating disk (the impeller)
      * distinctively louder white noise than the others
      * requires water low in minerals to prevent production of white dust and pm2.5 (0 TDS is best)
      * cannot use tap water (must be reverse osmosis, deionized, or best: distilled)
      * please let me know if you find others available
   * evaporative (e.g. Honeywell, Vornado, Aircare, Venta, Sunbeam, the new Levoit 6000s)
      * works by a fan and a wick (a material with a high surface area), accelerating evaporation
      * usually includes a filter for removing water minerals
      * lowest production of white dust and pm2.5 of the 4 options
      * can use tap water, but expect to replace filters regularly
      * note: evaporative coolers are very similar
      * HVAC systems may use the furnace to heat water, accelerating evaporation. 
* 1 produces a ""warm mist""
   * steam vaporizer (e.g. Vicks, Honeywell)
      * essentially a hot plate that nearly boils water to produce steam
      * lower production of white dust and pm2.5
      * can use tap water, but expect to clean off minerals on plate regularly
      * better during colder days as it heats the room
      * HVAC systems may use a electrodes to boil water, producing steam. 

All require some regularity of inspection and cleaning. FDA guidelines on cleaning and air quality safety for these 4 types of humidifiers: [https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2014-08/documents/humidifier\_factsheet.pdf](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2014-08/documents/humidifier_factsheet.pdf)

In addition, there are several other methods to raise humidity in a room, with varying efficiencies and trade-offs:

* drying lots of wet clothes on racks in the same room
   * most energy efficient option
* heating water on an thermostat controlled electric kettle set to below boiling (e.g. 95 degrees C)
   * better during colder days as it heats the room
   * essentially a steam vaporizer humidifier
* taking a hot shower, boiling a pot of water, etc.
   * will rapidly raise the temperature and humidity of a room temporarily
      * will also drop off the quickest",15,2023-11-28 00:09:09

Normal indoor air quality while running heat?,"

Edit: solved. Explanation in comments. Thanks!

I tried using Google and other Reddit communities but I haven't recieved solid answers.

As title suggests, I am curious what is considered normal indoor air quality while running the furnace.

During the worst of the air quality days in the summer from the wildfires in Canada, my indoor air quality for PM 2.5 would top off at 10 micrograms / cubic meter unless I was cooking. This was measured with my 3 air purifiers throughout the house.

As it has gotten colder and I have been running the furnace, I am now averaging around 50 micrograms / cubic meter for PM 2.5 and have had periods of time where it is above 100 for an hour or more with no other sources of combustion (cooking, candles, etc) and I'm wondering if this is normal. I did not have the air purifiers last fall or winter so I have nothing to compare it to.

For reference, ducts were cleaned this summer and I change my filter (11 MRV) whenever my thermostat tells me to. I have a gas furnace which I estimate to be about 20 years old (I can't find the model or install infol).

Any advice or opinions would be greatly appreciated to ease my mind on air quality as I have 2 young kids in and I don't want to give them any potential health issues. Thanks!",9,2023-11-16 21:48:15

Is VOC testing worth the cost?,"Hello! We're looking for some advice regarding a home air quality issue.

We purchased an Airthings VOC monitor a few months ago. We've been monitoring the VOC levels in our home and they seem okay on average over the past 30 days, 224 ppb. However, the levels sometimes randomly spike to near 1000 ppb and gradually reduce. We're in a townhome that was built in 2019 and it has a noticeable ""new home smell"". We've bought some cheaper air purifiers with active carbon filters, but they don't seem to have much of an effect on the readings.

Earlier today we called a local service that specializes in air quality testing. They indicated concern with what I was describing and suggested a $1000 comprehensive VOC test.

We're at a point where we're not sure what to do. We're only renting the unit so putting $1000 into an air quality assessment doesn't feel like a good investment. Unfortunately, our landlord doesn't seem interested in paying for the inspection. We're not sure if we should foot the bill and get the assessment done, just invest the $1000 into a more expensive air purifier, try to end our lease early, or do nothing.

Success At-Last! 😊,"There's likely a *reverse survivorship bias* on this group, which means that once a person has achieved success, they are not likely to seek help on this forum, or share their findings.  


We had a two-year long battle with indoor air quality, and we can finally say that we've come on top.  
After the wildfires, we had an Aprilaire 8145 8145 Fresh Air Ventilator installed, which was supposed to bring in filtered air to off-set the build-up of indoor VOCs. The effect which we experienced initially, was marginal. Until we realized that the ""fresh air intake"" that the builder had installed was incorrectly installed!  


They installed it as if it was an exhaust. That is, a flap opens to the outside when air is being exhausted out. In big bold embossed letters, the flap literally says that it should be removed, if it is being used as an intake.  


We did this, and lo and behold - a dramatic increase in air quality!  


Here are the numbers: [https://imgur.com/a/GtJ8JQH](https://imgur.com/a/GtJ8JQH)  


Context is everything, so this is from a 2000 SqFt  home, inside which we have 42% humidity, and a temperature of 24° C (75.2° F). It should be noted that VOCs are generally lower during cooler temperatures outside, and lower humidity indoors. Also, it is worth noting that the outside air quality is superior.

House built in 1970's. How can we figure out what's making us sick?,"We moved into our home a little over 2 years ago. It has really unique architecture which looks awesome but poses some structural issues. There are 4 above ground floors. No basement (but garage is under the house, above grade). There is a mud room with a crawl space behind the garage where the furnace is located. No attic. Metal flat roof. Airflow is terrible. So we had our furnace upgraded (not replaced), which we hoped would help us feel better, but it hasn't. Some of the original interior is in tact, but there was also a big remod in the 90s. We tested the water. It's fine. However, we haven't tested the insulation in the crawl space or any materials for asbestos. Some of the sheetrock looks original still. Some of the tile in the kitchen pantries look suspect. There's a ton of wood. Most of the ceilings are stained wood planks. Wood floors. Wood accent walls. Yes. I mean actual wood. All the wood makes me wonder if someone tried to cover up visible mold? There is some carpet. Some popcorn ceilings. We constantly have coughs, puffy eyes, fatigue, and lightheadedness. It's not carbon monoxide. We had the radon levels tested when we moved in, but the homeowners forgot to keep the windows closed beforehand, and I'm not sure how huge of an impact that could have made on the result. Our air purifiers are signaling that the air quality is good. What are some common culprits that could be causing us to feel this way in our home? Mold? VOCs?

VOC due to new carpet,"I ""moved into"" a new apartment last Friday and noticed an odor. I noticed the odor when I signed the lease last week but I thought it was paint and would dissipate in a couple of days. It didn't. As a result, I didn't actually live in it and only moved some stuff in. I tried airing it out over the weekend by opening all the windows and the smell is still there by Monday, although it might be weaker. I complained about the smell to management. Turns out it's a new carpet smell. I was told by management that they replaced the carpet and that smell is ""very familiar"" to them. They offered to steam clean it tomorrow.

Fortunately, I will be gone for a week after tomorrow and I plan to open all the blinds to maximize sunshine in the room. Also plan to turn on the HVAC fan (management said it vents to the outside, which is interesting...) I also purchased 2 air purifiers from Lowes. I plan to use both air purifiers in my bedroom, where I spend 99 % of my time when I come back. My bedroom is around 100 sqft and each air purifier is advertised for 170 sq ft. It's made by Filtrete and in addition to HEPA medium, the filter also comes with an active carbon sheet layer that is supposed to help with odor. I'm really not sure if it's sufficient (the carbon layer) for whatever VOC level a week from now.

I kinda want to boost my active carbon adsorption capacity so that even if there are significant off gassing, I can lower it to a very low level. Can you recommend a good, powerful purifier/system? I'm more interested in the active carbon filtration than the particulate filtration. 

In short, I hope that I can in a week time, build something using off the shelf component that can more powerfully absorb the VOCs than consumer air purifiers. Something that allow me to use a generous amount of active carbon granules.

Particulate air pollution from clothes dryer,"I've recently built homemade air purifiers and bought the Ikea air quality monitor ([https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/vindstyrka-air-quality-sensor-smart-30498239/](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/vindstyrka-air-quality-sensor-smart-30498239/)).

I've just learned that the clothes dryer in the basement of my tri-plex causes indoor air pollution.  That's what has been causing periodic spikes in the particle count.  Given this, putting one or more small air purifiers in the basement seems to be a good idea, because it's best to clean the air near the pollution source.

I've now seen articles confirming that clothes dryers cause air pollution.  But exactly how is all that pollution becoming airborne?  I thought that the exhaust from the dryer is vented outside through the dryer duct and filtered at some point.  Is there some way to keep the pollution in the dryer duct and filter where it belongs?",6,2023-09-27 02:03:46
How to lower TVOC in winter when it’s freezing outside & windows need to be shut to keep in the heating?,"Or when it’s raining & windows need to be shut? Do activated bamboo charcoal bags work?

High VOC when in bed - finding unclear source?," 

Hi folks, 

My airthings is showing relatively high VOC periodically. 

Pattern is pretty much rising amounts for the time when we're in bed, although we keep a window tilt open. 

Just kept the door and window shut all day, values are fine. 

So I suspected the mattresses as emitting the VOC through sleep moment and went jumping on them with closed window and door for quite a bit - so much more movement than rolling over at night or so - and left.  
Values didn't move. 

What else comes to mind that could fit this pattern? 

Thanks a lot!",3,2023-09-26 14:09:40

"Statement on Mustardman's, a moderator on Air Purifiers, statement.","Recently a moderator from AirPurfiers crossed posted what amounts to a mean spirited hit piece on  Clean Air Kits. Admittedly there were a couple of valid  technical issues that need to be explored, but the negative personal accusations were so intermingled with the few valid technical points that its impossible to deconstruct the piece as presented.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AirPurifiers/comments/16lc4r7/statement\_on\_clean\_air\_kits\_and\_david\_elfstrom/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirPurifiers/comments/16lc4r7/statement_on_clean_air_kits_and_david_elfstrom/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

As I had an extensive ""back and forth"" with Mustardman about 6 months ago on the topic I think I can add  some needed perspective. As far as his ugly, unsupported personal insults (deception, distorting data for personal gain and such) I'll let stand for now. I'm confident that folks that are familiar with the players involved will take Mustardman's accusations as saying more about him than anyone else.

**Disclaimer:**Mustardman banned me from AirPurifiers months ago. Anyone can search for my last exchange if interested. I have stated before that I don't trust Mustardman as far good faith and fair play goes. A lot of my reasoning (valid or not) should be clear with this post.

About 6 months ago there was an extensive discussion on PC fan based air purifiers and Clean Air Kits.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AirPurifiers/comments/16lc4r7/statement\_on\_clean\_air\_kits\_and\_david\_elfstrom/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirPurifiers/comments/16lc4r7/statement_on_clean_air_kits_and_david_elfstrom/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

After accusing a poster of nefarious motivations (absurd!!), Mustardman presented a coherent, well documented case why PC fan based systems would under perform compared to a non PC fan based system in large rooms.

His arguments and supporting data made sense. I was intrigued. I inquired if there was any supporting data that this effect applied to APs in real rooms. He ignored my request for data and seemed to insist that the physics demanded it be so. As far as I could tell he was so convinced confiming data was not required.

This was a huge red flag because the test to confirm or deny his thesis was incredibly easy - so easy in fact any motivated  home owner could test in their living room.

**Here's How**:

According to Mustardman's theory a PC fan based AP and a standard AP that had the same CADR in the standard AHAM 1000 ft3 enclosure would perform differently in a larger room. The PC fan system would under perform the father away from the purifier. All a home user needs to test is a particle meter and a living room.

The more I insisted that this simple test is all that's the nastier mustardman became with personal insults. At this point it was clear that mustardman was not being reasonable i.e. operating in good faith.

**New Development:**

This June Jim Rosenthal performed a test to see if air velocity (throw) was a factor in limiting the effectiveness of PC fan based AP.

By the way Jim **R**osenthal is the **R** in **CR box**. He knows what he is doing. The 6 PC fan system was just as effective as the Mila Hepa and 10db quieter.

A larger room would be needed provide dispositive  results, but  simple test like this are all that's needed to Totally resolve the question. The mean ugly excessive tone (lies -imo) that mustardman spewed serves no purpose.

A**ustin Air and Hypocrocisy on** /r/AirPurifiersAirPurifiers had a pinned ""**Air Purifier Guide""** that listed Austin Air as ""best of"" high end purifiers. Many folks look at the guide assuming the ""expert moderators"" know what they are talking about. In fact, at least 2 independent test have shown the Austin Air has a very low CADR relative to price. The response from the moderators has been the Austin has a lot of carbon and no comment about it's lousy PM performance. Wouldn't it be ironic if the 6 fan ""Clean Air Kit"" , which is being dissed by mustardman , out performs the Austin (for particulates) which is being praised on AirPurifiers.",20,2023-09-21 04:48:40

How safe is this classroom situation when outdoor AQI is high from wildfire smoke?,"My kid's school keeps doors and windows open at all times for covid risk reduction. Today, California is having a terrible air day due to wild fires. In my kid's class, two doors and three windows are open, and three HEPA filters are going. The HEPAs are placed to maximize covid protection instead of cleaning the incoming door/window air.

At the end of the day, the PM2.5 sensor was 34 ug/m3. Which makes sense since the wildfire measurements (via Purple Air) ramped up at 11:30 today, peaked at 50 ug/m3 at 12:30, then gradually dissipated. It was 33 ug/m3 outside when I picked up my kid today.

My kid wears a KF94 for school because of a family medical issue, so I feel pretty confident that that has filtered out most PM in the air. We actually have the option to stay home tomorrow if the outdoor air quality doesn't continue to get better (she really wants to go though, she loves it). Curious what people think? Everything I've learned about air quality over the past 2 years has been around covid mitigations or indoors/shut with HEPAs for wildfire season, so this is a slightly different situation.",4,2023-08-30 23:16:40
PM monitor for airborne infection risk assessment,"I’m looking into getting a portable air monitor, mostly to assess risk of covid and other airborne illnesses in indoor spaces in conjunction with my CO2 monitor. I’ve found the CO2 monitor (Vitalight Mini) really useful to get a sense of how well ventilated a space is, but it doesn’t provide any info on the air purification of indoor spaces. 

Would a <$100 PM2.5 monitor like the [Qingping Air Monitor Lite](https://breathesafeair.com/qingping-air-monitor-lite-review/) be sufficient to provide a rough idea of the filtration of a space? Is there a benefit to PM1.0 or lower sensors over PM2.5, and if so, are there any <$200 models anyone would recommend? If the PM2.5 is enough, is there anything cheaper than the Qingping that *only* does PM2.5 and does it with reasonable accuracy (don’t need it to be very precise)?

Here are the types of questions I’m hoping this kind of monitor can help answer:

1. When do I need to replace my air purifier filters (the manufacturers give a pretty wide range)?

2. How effective are my air purifiers at home and in the office (do I need to get more, run them at higher speeds, replace the filters, etc) - is it safe to unmask in my office to eat when the door is closed, do I have enough air purifiers at home to effectively filter out the wildfire smoke?

3. On a bus or plane, how effective are the HEPA filters? Does opening the AC vent on a bus help or hurt?

4. At a dentist office that doesn’t have great ventilation, how much are the air purifiers helping?

"Winix, Hydroxyls, and Vocs","I've been banned from the ""AirPurifier"" sub and couldn't respond to this thread,  ""**Why do people keep claiming that Winix units are helpful for odor control?""**

The claim was made that some Winix models, due to their bipolar ion generators, produce hydroxly ions that reduce TVoc levels in homes. I've seen no reason to believe that's true. 

I still wait for any evidence, outside of marketing spin, that bipolar ion generators even  produce substantial hydroxyls concentatons. Two recent high quality academic studies specifically tested bipolar ion technolgy and found them not effective for voc reductions.

There is substantial evidence that hydroxyls can be effective when voc concentrations very, very high. But in those situations special catalytic materials are used in conjunction with high  energy photons - PCO technology. And even then very very high concentration are reduced to levels that are still very, very high and not safe for human habitation 

Here's a very good academic review of current PCO technology:

journal:[https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/21/1/56/htm](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/21/1/56/htm) \- Highly recommended article!

**“Currently most studies demonstrate their VOCs removal efficiency in a high concentration level (e.g., ppmv). More on-site demonstrations should be conducted in order to prove the efficiency in removal of indoor VOCs in realistic environments (e.g., residential and work spaces).”**

I'm still very interested in hydroxyls to reduce vocs. It's a very attractive technology. Nothing sounds better - Introduce hydroxyls into you living space and voc are reduced to water and CO2 - what could be cleaner and better yet this works continually.  Unfortunately, as far as living spaces go,  this has not been demonstrated, despite the fact that it is repeated over and over by home users and manufacturers.

The other part is more fun, where we get to see the visualizations as graphs!  


It has views to show the PM 2.5, or VOC readings, over time (day, week, month, year).  


Everything is run locally, and I don't have to rely on any 3rd party service, or API.   


It's been pretty useful in terms of learning what the air quality was like overnight, or when there were spikes in air quality, and whether a certain mitigation (such as the installation of an HRV, Dehumidifier, new piece of furniture) has improved, or degraded air quality.

Why is PM 2.5 higher indoors?,"I just moved to a new apartment, and I’m confused why my PM 2.5 readings are always higher indoors than outdoors. I have a Temtop monitor and it’s very consistently showing 35 indoors, and 30 outdoors. 

I’m on the fourth floor, and my window faces a courtyard that is to the side of the building. When I measure the air on the first floor in the courtyard, the PM 2.5 is 30, like everywhere outdoors. When I measure the air in the street in front of the building, it’s 30. When I put the monitor all the way at my window, the one on the fourth floor opening to that same courtyard, the PM 2.5 is 34. And inside the apartment, it’s around 35-36 consistently.

The apartment is really quite empty. It was painted and re-varnished about a month ago.
They used a cheap oil based polyurethane, but I thought that would cause TVOC, not PM 2.5. Other than that in the apartment, there’s just like a couple of pieces of wood furniture, and some cushions. There’s the old oak wood floor, that I assume was sanded a month ago when they did the revarnishing, or maybe just buffed. But would that cause particles? The floors are of course clean. 

So, what on earth could cause the higher readings from indoors?

I’d love to know if anyone has any thoughts!!",7,2023-07-24 16:24:53
What technical difference between these two monitors justifies the 4x difference in cost?,"As far as I can tell, much of the technical specs are similar. They both satisfy the same ISO requirements. Same flow rate. Same particle size detection. But I figure given the difference in price there has to be something better about the AeroTrak device.

1'' MERV 13 filter with low pressure drop?,"Do 1-inch MERV 13 filters with a low pressure drop exist? With the filtrete filters our furnace can't handle anything with a pressure drop higher than a MERV 11/MPR 1000. And it doesn't look like there's enough room in there to fit anything thicker than 1 inch. I'm wondering if there are any 1'' MERV 13 filters with low pressure drops, comparable to a MERV 11 filtrete? Or is that a pipe dream?

(The MERV 11 filtrete's initial resistance values at 410, 615, 820, 1025, and 1390 CFM are 0.9, 0.16, 0.23, 0.32, and 0.48 IWC respectively.)",5,2023-07-21 09:35:41
Portable Carbon Monoxide monitor,"Anyone have recs for affordable, good quality, accurate portable CO monitor?",4,2023-07-20 17:07:44
Recommended Portable Air Quality Monitor?,"So with the wildfire smoke I'm looking for a portable air quality monitor that will tell me at least the pm2.5 which I could carry around easily from room to room and take with me outside, sort of like what the Aranet does for CO2, only with at least pm2.5. If it could tell me even more information, that would be even better. Some models also have pm10 and tVOC, and I was thinking of getting a model that claimed to be able to do all of these, but I read there's no regulation for air quality monitors and cheaper ones often aren't that accurate, especially for VOC. Would a cheaper air quality monitor be able to give me any useful information about tVOC, even if it's just letting me know if there's a spike?

I've heard people recommend the Qingpings and the Temtop M2000 2nd gen for pm2.5. I noticed there are other models on the Temtop website, I was thinking of getting the Temtop M10 for the pm2.5 since it's smaller and cheaper and also has a tVOC sensor and formaldehyde sensor, but would the tVOC and formaldehyde sensor be useable for anything, even if all they can do is tell me if there's spike in those things? Or would they be completely useless? Is the pm2.5 on the M10 even roughly accurate enough to be useful, or would I need one of the larger more expensive models for the pm2.5 too? Of the larger more expensive models Temtop has, such as the Temtop M2000 2nd and Temtop LKC-1000S+ 2nd, some claim to be able to detect pm10, tVOC, and formaldehyde. With the Qingpings, the Qingping air monitor claims to detect tVOCs (though it looks awkward to carry around) and the Qingping air monitor lite (which looks more convenient to carry) claims to detect pm10. Could I assume those are roughly accurate, at least enough to be useful for detecting spikes? Or are those claims useless and I shouldn't expect to find anything that could tell me useable information about those things for under $1000?
If anyone has any other recommended brands for detecting any of these things btw, I'm interested. And I'm most interested in detecting pm2.5.

Additionally, to get a sense of what's accurate for pm2.5 and pm10, I've been looking at this list: https://www.aqmd.gov/aq-spec/evaluations/criteria-pollutants/summary-pm

Can anyone help me interpret it?

Of the three Temtop brand ones under $900 that are on that list, it looks like the Temtop LKC-1000S+ is the best (oddly enough, even better than their $960 one), with a field R² of 0.91 to 0.92 for pm2.5. However, it only has a field R² of 0.31 to 0.35 for the pm10. The Qingping lite, meanwhile, has an R² of 0.85 to 0.93 for pm2.5 and R² of 0.37 to 0.43 for pm10. Does that mean I can get roughly accurate information about the pm2.5 from these things, but I should take the pm10 information with a large grain of salt? Would their pm10 detectors be able to tell me any useful information? The list also mentions the field MAE, I'm not sure how to interpret that.

Would should I make of this list's information?",9,2023-07-20 01:58:16

Accuracy of IKEA Vindstyrka/Sensirion SEN54?,"In light of all the forest fires I recently got Ikea's new air quality meter, Vindstyrka. However, PM2.5 measurements on the device, when placed outdoors, are much higher than those reported by the local ministry of the environment. Although I understand smoke concentration can have local variation, I am roughly equidistant from three government-operated sensing stations and the Vindstyrka's readings are quite a ways off from each station (relative to the specs in the [official documentation](https://www.sensirion.com/media/documents/293A9243/62276619/Sensirion_Product_Brochure_SEN5x.pdf)).

For example, an hour ago the three nearby government stations (each of which is about 8 km away from me in different directions) reported 26, 31, and 28 µg/m3. Meanwhile, at the same time Vindstyrka was reporting around 48-55 µg/m3. *edit:* The following hour, official readings were 31, 34, and 37 µg/m3 while my unit was reporting 66...

IQAir vs. Austin air purifiers for VOCs?,"We have Airthings air quality monitors in multiple rooms of our house, and we sometimes have high TVOCs (total VOC) over night.  We live across the street from a strip mall with a dry cleaner and several restaurants and we think that is probably the source.

To try to mitigate that we bought an Austin Air Systems Healthmate Plus.  It has 15 lbs of activated charcoal and is clearly very effective for reducing particulates in the air (PM 2.5 and PM 1.0), but seems to have little to no effect on the TVOC levels, as measured by the Airthings monitors.  Their website and support line claim to be able to reduce TVOCs, but we have not seen that ourselves.

I have recently been reading about the IQAir GC Multigas air purifier.  It is more expensive than the Austin unit and claims to have additional tech to help mitigate / trap VOCs and some gases.  Has anyone had any experience with this air purifier, and can verify if it helps with VOCs?

We are considering moving, there doesn’t seem to be anything that we can to mitigate this issue.

Also, we have read about the TVOC measurement accuracy problem with consumer grade meters.  I should probably take the sensors outside to refresh them, but we’re thinking that even if they might sometimes report inaccurately high TVOC levels, when we look at the relative TVOC readings on different nights it probably indicates that we have a serious problem.

Any suggestions will be appreciated!",4,2023-07-15 09:00:29

"Ongoing Air Quality Saga, Part ... 5/6/unknown!","Here's the last part (which has links to the previous chapters):

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AirQuality/comments/14sq6s3/air\_quality\_saga\_part\_4\_5\_ongoing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirQuality/comments/14sq6s3/air_quality_saga_part_4_5_ongoing/)

Here's the latest:

***VOC levels continue to be moderate-ish:*** When I've got a window open venting, VOC levels tend to sit around 50-100 which is ... pretty good! When the windows are all closed (see humidity below) it tends to be at around 200-250, which is not as good but not the worst. Levels do occasionally spike for NO REASON, though. Like, some spikes are obvious - we opened the back door and were grilling chicken on the deck, or cooked with garlic. Or whatever. But others are unexplained. That said, the total VOC level has little bearing on my personal symptoms. Obviously when the levels are 600-700 I'm affected, but I could have a very bad day at 50-100 or a very good day at 200-250.

**Humidity is the enemy:** Our humidity here is out of control. Even with the windows closed, I need a standalone dehumidifier to keep levels under 50%. I'm working with the HVAC company on a fix (not sure if it's the current system or our filters or what). But in the meantime I've got a Toshiba 50pint unit and the dry rooms DO feel better. So whatever I'm reactive to is carried/increased by humidity. I can't leave the window open - even venting - when it's 99% humidity, the makeup air (wherever it comes from) is just too humid!

***ERV System is going to be comprehensive:*** The RenewAire EV130 now ships with dual MERV13 filters. So all air entering the house will be MERV13 filtered, as well as dehumidified and climate adjusted. Really hoping this blunts the worst of the problem.

***Air test guy delayed:*** The air quality company is redoing all their tests that could have been affected by the propane leak for a housecall fee + $100. Nice discount, but annoying to have to pay again. Friday and today didn't work out so the plan is for noontime tomorrow. 

***The weather is awful:*** It's been 95% humidity or higher every day for 2 weeks. Most of those days have been raining, and only 2 of them have been 80 degrees or higher. So the AC doesn't really run much. Right now I've got it set to 69 in here, it's 72 outside and it isn't running at all. So the air is getting stagnant. Again, the ERV should help with this A LOT.

***Pretty sure my sensitivity is to a gas of some kind:*** Call it a VOC, call it a gas, but it's not particulate. It is, however, mitigated by a KN95 mask. So... who knows?

***Looking into high carbon air purifiers:*** On the off chance that the ERV alone doesn't cut it, for seasons when whatever I'm allergic to is rampant I'm considering getting an Austin Air HealthMate Plus (or the equivalent AirPura unit) with like 20lbs. of carbon to just neutralize the air. Open to recommendations. They supposedly handle 1000 square feet easily. My buddy with chemical sensitivity has one AirPura on the first floor and one in the basement and he loves them.

***Trying to be hopeful:*** I have a day job, kids to care for, and I'd really like for my wife to not leave me in frustration or murder me in my sleep, so I'm trying to stay hopeful. I'm taking breaks out of the house when needed, and taking ... measures ... to stay calm. I remain very frustrated that we might not be able to identify the SOURCE of the problem. Mitigation is fine, but not being able to even identify the source much less eliminate it is very upsetting to me. Like, the idea that there's something in the house off-gassing a substance that makes me react like this... and that we might just NEVER find it but simply dilute or neutralize it... is a sub-par solution in my mind. I'm having a very hard time with it.",5,2023-07-10 21:10:34

Trouble breathing above AQI 30. Has this happened to anyone else?,"I have asthma. I live in NYC, in a very porous prewar building, and one of my roommates is a smoker. This past month has been brutal, and I've noticed that whenever the AQI is above 30, it gets hard for me to breathe: my chest feels heavy, and my throat begins to feel sore. I have an air purifier (Winix 5500-2) at full blast, but I still have trouble breathing, even indoors, so I've been wearing an N95 essentially 24/7 whenever the air is bad. I tried to consult a doctor about this, but they seemed to feel a lot of judgment around how I was masking while sleeping (they thought that was causing the sore throat, when I only wake up with a sore throat if I don't use a good enough mask, lol). They said there was nothing more I could do, as I was doing everything I could.

"Air Quality Saga, Part 4? 5? Ongoing!","The previous chapter of my saga can be found here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AirQuality/comments/14iza0n/mystery\_reaction\_to\_my\_house\_remediation\_update/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirQuality/comments/14iza0n/mystery_reaction_to_my_house_remediation_update/)

Which has the links to all the previous chapters. Warning - lots of reading.

TL;DR - I have been reacting to the first floor (and only the first floor) of my home for a year now. We've lived here for 2 years. First year was uneventful, the following spring I had bad reaction - burning eyes, felt like I was inhaling something caustic. Settled down in the summer, fall (had a dust reaction when we turned on the furnace, but it passed), and winter. Flared back up this year in February/March due to the early thaw. HVAC problems were found, and remediated. Air quality testing found a propane leak on the stove, high CO2, and high VOC.

Now on to the updates!

***Stove Replacement Is In:*** We got an induction stove. It's amazing. It cost about $300 more than the gas model, and we had to wire a circuit for it (we had taken the old one out 2 years ago, oops! Hindsight and all...) but there's a state rebate and we got some money back for the unused propane... so we're out a few hundred all told on the stove debacle, and we got a MUCH better stove. It boils water in 90 seconds. It's insane.

***VOC levels are still unacceptable:*** I have an exhaust fan running in my home office pulling air out of the house. VOC levels are still between 50-150 all the time (my back porch, for reference, is 7). Yesterday I turned off the vent fan and closed the windows and turned up the AC... and VOC levels on the first floor jumped to 500-700. Ventilating now, and we've been as low as 150 today but bouncing between 150-250. I clearly have some source of VOC, as yet unaccounted for, primarily on the first floor. When it gets bad mid-day (it's worst in the afternoons), the upstairs VOC levels also rise especially at the top of the stairs, but I am not as reactive up there (clearly whatever I'm reacting to is primarily on the first floor). The basement VOC levels are also high often because of the washer and dryer, as well as the scented plug-ins down there (the kids are smelly). But again not as reactive for me. 

***We have a quote for an ERV:*** We clearly need ventilation. When the exhaust fan runs, the first floor is more reasonable and the second floor is downright pleasant. When winter comes, the lower air pressure outside pulls a draft and the whole house is pretty ok. I'm hoping the ERV can simulate this year-round, and at least make the bad season tolerable.

***Air Testing Company is returning:*** They never ran the full air analysis (where they send samples to the lab) because the propane leak would have just fouled the results. Now that there's no longer a risk of that, they're returning to get new baseline VOC readings and run the air analysis. I'm a little concerned with the ongoing cost, but they charge the same as everyone else for the lab analysis ($250ish). Am I thrilled about paying for another 'house call'? Not especially, but while I've got him here I'll make him look everywhere for possible causes.

***I'm going back to the allergist:*** Once the air analysis is back, I'll go see the allergist to find out if there's anything that they can do for me that they aren't already doing.

***I'm frustrated:*** After all of this effort, I'm still having bad days. My wife makes me admit that the bad days aren't as bad as before, now that the propane is gone - I was clearly super reactive to that, the burning nasal passages and eyes seem to have abated. But I'm frustrated. We've ruled out a lot of things, and honestly we've made significant improvements to the home - fixing HVAC ducts, replacing a leaking stove, etc. - but I'm frustrated that we have yet to find a root cause. I suspect that once we get a few more days into this hot weather, the AC will calm things down a lot (it did last year). ",9,2023-07-06 23:52:31

This seems like the perfect solution, as I'm having an issue regarding a persistent smell and possible high VOC levels in 2 unventilatable areas. But there doesn't appear to be a consensus on whatever or not it will help with my problem. One camp says that that it won't remove smells nor VOCs. The other camp says that it absolutely will.

"Maintaining healthy CO2 levels while sleeping, windows closed?","Is it reasonable to rely on central air ventilation in a big rental building to circulate CO2 enough to not go over 900 PPM while sleeping with another person (2 total in unit)? We're in a junior one bedroom apartment.

Air outside is bad (in Ontario right now) so we need to keep windows closed. We have an air purifier, about to get another (stronger) one. No AC, never bothered to install and were fine before the wildfires became so awful.

I'm really sensitive and seem to get scratchy throat/awful cough/burning eyes anywhere above 30ug/m3 PM2.5 for more than a couple of hours.

Mystery Reaction to My House - Remediation & Update,"The first few chapters of this saga, as well as the 'OMG WE FOUND IT' post can be found here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AirQuality/comments/147t82n/mystery\_reaction\_to\_my\_house\_found\_a\_smoking\_gun/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirQuality/comments/147t82n/mystery_reaction_to_my_house_found_a_smoking_gun/)

So here's the update:

***The Stove Was Defective!***

Had the gas guy out, and the coupling was bad. But so was the regulator on the stove. A slow but definite propane leak. He checked and double checked and triple checked everything else including the pressure coming off the tank - no abnormalities. Just a defective stove. It's probably been leaking propane for A WHILE, considering my 150lb. tank is down to 20lbs. in 18 months of just using the stove. Wow.

Home Depot Extended warranty for the win. Reimbursed the full purchase price PLUS tax PLUS delivery and haul-away. We decided, after much debate and research on propane inside the house, to get an induction stove. It will be here Wednesday. Electrician is already lined up to restore the 220V line behind the stove, and gas fitter is already lined up to cap the gas and purge the line.

***It took forever to air out!***

Like, several days. And I foolishly tried to help it along by opening windows ... which let in the pollen. And the humidity. And only sort of helped. ARGH. Right now I'm running a window fan pointed out in my front window. Sadly, this lets in the humidity still. And creates negative pressure on the 1st floor which means everything in the house is still ending up in my office. But the air purifiers are keeping particle counts low.

***VOC levels are still moderate, and need more testing.***

I clearly have a source of VOCs in the house, or a gas to which I'm reactive. Not sure what, the air quality people will come back next week to run the full spectrometer test on air samples. Then we'll know exactly what is in the air. My AirThings reads anywhere from 50 to 150 all the time with the exhaust running. Without exhaust, it's 150+ most of the time. So there's SOMETHING in here.

***I'm Still Reacting to Something...***

But nowhere near as badly. The worst it gets right now is like 25% as bad as before. Probably a VOC or gas (see above). The upstairs has been great, as has been the half of the 1st floor furthest from the exhaust fan (the room with the exhaust fan of course is causing me the worst symptoms as everything that's leaving the house is floating around in there.

***I had a ventilation analysis, quote forthcoming.***

The HVAC folks sent their ventilation expert out. He found quite a few things that's he's working into a scope of work. The house gets no fresh air except ironically in the middle of winter, so he's proposing an ERV with humidification and de-humidification, MERV 13 filtration, and fan control. Additionally he found an issue with the 1st/2nd zone damping controls, so the 1st floor never really closes its damper ever which results in unintentional airflow and screws with the thermostats. And lastly there are some pressure issues which ought to also be improved with the ERV since there will be an exhaust built right into the system. I'll probably also get an ""Air Bear"" as part of the deal, which is a huge 6"" filter that drastically cuts down on airborne particles while also improving flow significantly. Bracing myself for the bill which is likely to be $5k or more, but should make my system as good as it possibly can be without completely re-engineering the house.

...

Anyway, I'll keep y'all updated.

***Edit: decided to get an induction stove instead of gas. The air here isn’t perfect but it’s so much better since we turned off the propane that I’m loathe to get another one, if there's even the slightest chance of gas escaping. New induction unit will be here Wednesday and the wife gets new pots to boot! Plus this saves us from having to add extra kitchen ventilation. We're actually going to cap off and remove all the propane from the house - the valves have all been closed but there's no reason to keep it hooked up and pressurized if we aren't going to use it.***

# NINE MONTH UPDATE:

So, it wasn't the smoking gun after all, or at least not the only one. I'm still fighting with this, albeit on a smaller scale. I have more good days than before, and never have the ""it burns"" that I had with the propane leak, so that's a plus. Recently located an oil leak under my home office (in the fill pipes for the oil tank) that was likely putting fumes into my walls, and I've got a call in to the state energy efficiency people who are going to come do a pressure test on the house. My suspicion at this point is that outside air pressure pushes in on my walls which likely have some leakage... and then whatever VOC/fume is in the walls seeps into the first floor. 

Since fixing the oil tank (and a few other furnace issues) it's been much better a lot of the time. Warm weather as well as high outdoor pressure still makes the air in here a lot less pleasant (only for me, others are still unaffected) but I feel like a lot of progress has been made.",11,2023-06-25 22:24:16
Air Quality Conference,"The organisers of this air quality conference in England have posted the slides from the various speakers' presentations. Obviously they're slightly out of context without the actual speech, but some here may find them interesting. Each presentation linked individually under the chat about the presenter...

[https://airqualitynews.com/features-opinion/report-the-south-west-wales-air-quality-conference-2023/](https://airqualitynews.com/features-opinion/report-the-south-west-wales-air-quality-conference-2023/)",4,2023-06-23 22:02:30
Effectiveness of PC Fan based purifiers and a personal grievance,"Some months ago there was a spirited discussion on the value of PC fan based particulate purifiers.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AirPurifiers/comments/11otr46/comment/jbvoh9p/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirPurifiers/comments/11otr46/comment/jbvoh9p/)

A case was made that even though PC fan based purifiers might have an impressive CADR rating it would perform poorly on a metric I had not considered previously - air mixing. So although the PC fan system could score a high CARD in the 1000ft3 AHAM chamber, its performance might drop off rapidly in larger rooms where a similarly rated non PC fan purifier would  perform much better.

I was fascinated as I've never heard or considered that factor before. Also the concept made a lot of sense. Standard AHAM CADR testing is done in a small 1000ft3 chamber where the air is externally mixed. Perhaps there is something to this story.

This is important as PC fan system have two advantages - They are very, very quiet (42db) and lean on power consumption (as low as 10 watts). I asked the poster if there is any experimental  data to confirm. Instead of data he responded with theoretical reasons of why physics demanded it be true. I responded that data is needed especially since notion could be proved or denied by simple testing any home owner could do. The conversation devolved into insults, name calling, references to my inability to understand physics and even aspersions to fraud and ineptness to a company that provides these systems.

Well it seems that PC fans based purifiers have been tested exactly as I had envisioned.The PC fans systems held their own without the degradation that was suggested.The testing was done by Jim rosenthal  of Corsi-Rosenthal box fame.Here's a discussion of his results:

[https://www.texairfilters.com/comparing-the-performance-of-corsi-rosenthal-boxes-made-with-box-fans-and-pc-fans/](https://www.texairfilters.com/comparing-the-performance-of-corsi-rosenthal-boxes-made-with-box-fans-and-pc-fans/)

In fairness there is a caveat:*The chamber was about 3x the size used in AHAM tester. Perhaps performance would have fallen off with greater in a much larger room (compared to a Non PC fan base purifier with the same CADR).*

**EDIT 6-26-2023 7:00PM**  
**The PC fan systems were tested against  a Mila running at medium and a CR Box Fan system running at low**

But considering how quiet and thrifty these device are, they should not be written off as was suggested in the original post.

I would have  posted this directly in the Air Purifier sub but I have been banned by the same poster mentioned above. If someone is interested in posting in Air Purifiers, it might be useful for folks that  followed the thread. I've received requests from some but cannot respond.

How to deal with potential mold allergy? (On top of VOC issues),"I’ve been having issues with my health since moving to a new place. I strongly believe it’s VOC related. Now I think I could potentially be allergic to mold in the air on top of the VOC issues ( I don’t mean I have mold growth in my place). 

The mold count for where I live is currently high when I look it up on the weather sites. 

I think I will have to go to the doctors to get a definite answer about my body and reaction to mold, but in the mean time I would like some tips to help me feel better in my home. 

I currently have two purifiers going,  Winix and Dyson tower, both have new filters. The AC is on almost non stop and I also have a dehumidifier that’s on for a good portion of the day. 

I was previously opening the windows as much as I could to air out the place to rid the VOCs but it’s now significantly hotter outside so I’ve limited the opening of windows. 

I feel like I’m fighting a battle between ventilation for VOC, but also trying to mitigate humidity and potential mold allergy. 

What else can I do in my home if I assume that I do have a reaction to mold?",7,2023-06-20 15:30:21

So...

Had the firm ""Indoor Doctor"" out today to run a full home air health test. Certain tests will take a few days - advanced allergens, mold, etc.

But WHOA we found that my gas stove, which uses propane, had a very slow leak. Not enough to smell but enough to raise the VOC level in the house to 250 everywhere, and more like 350 in the adjacent rooms. Behind the stove the VOC level was 800+!

We turned off the gas to the stove and opened windows, and it slowly abated.

I am already feeling significantly better. I don't know that this was THE cause, but it was bad.

We also determined that the CO2 level in the house is very high - 1000 on a good day, 1300 steady state. It should be much lower. I'm going to get an air exchanger installed - fresh air intake, stale air exhaust.

I'll keep everyone updated but WOW. I've already called and the gas company is on the way over to address it. May need the stove repaired or replaced, though.

How long until my shortness of breath from poor air quality go away?,"I had COVID a few months ago and was just starting to recover fully from a bout of long COVID.

After about 15 min, I started to feel extremely short of breath and had chest pain. Like I was going to pass out. I had to sit down and drink something.

Both units agree my PM2.5 is very low with the exhaust fan running and air purifiers going. If I turn those off the PM2.5 jumps up from 1 to 10 pretty quickly. I’ll test later to see how high it gets. 

My CO2 is just below 1000 steady state. If I put two or three people in a room or cook it jumps up.

No formaldehyde according to the TemTop. Radon is low (0.4) according to Airthings. My air is very clean by all indications and yet my eyes are watering and my nose is irritated within minutes of entering the house.

Left windows open during worst day of air quality warnings in Philly,"I wanted to share my experience partly to see if there is any precaution I am missing regarding my smoke exposure and partly to commiserate with others who did the same thing I did since I haven't seen that many posts about it.

I had multiple windows open until about 3pm on the worst day of Philly's air quality warnings, and all through the night before. I was inside the whole time - my neighbors have a fire pit and I thoughtlessly assumed the smoke smell was from that. Once I realized what was happening, I closed all the windows, turned on all the fans, and went to a neighbor's apartment across the hall in the building. Immediately ordered a HEPA air purifier, and found another place to sleep for the next two nights.

In the middle all of this, I was extremely frustrated by how I couldn't quickly find public guidance about what to do /after/ the smoke is in your home - mind you *while* you're in it and it's *much worse* to go outside. I felt I had to act fast but there was no easy guide I could find on what to do.

Two days later (today), my air purifier has arrived. I placed it in both my living room and bedroom for  a couple hours each, and immediately got ""Very Good"" air ratings. I wonder how this is possible given that there's been no circulation in the building - I'm guessing particles and carbon monoxide dissipate over time (it's been 48 hours)?

**Long story short my lungs still hurt from the exposure. Will I worsen my exposure if I sleep in my place tonight (again, purifier is reading ""Very Good"" but not sure if there's some aspect I'm missing)? Should I clean all my surfaces while masked?  Do I gotta change all the sheets? Any long-term health effects I should watch out for?**

Thanks for reading. Will certainly be paying closer attention to omens of environmental disaster in the sky going forward...",3,2023-06-10 02:35:42
Indoor Air Quality VS Outdoor Test Over The last Week,"I was curious how much closing the windows actually would help indoor air quality, since the air outside was so saturated. I figured eventually we would reach some kind of equilibrium and the indoor air would be as bad as the outdoor air. Luckily that was not the case. This is what I found out:

The first graph is an outdoor PM2.5 monitor, and the 2nd one is the monitor inside my house.

https://preview.redd.it/cd6tkvzw935b1.png?width=982&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3bf9e3072ee45a2513ec89e6f980b77d5f51e7e

I was able to maintain decent air quality by closing the windows and running the furnace fan 24/7 to help try and filter the air. I do have a 4in MERV 12 filter in my furnace and my house is fairly tight, meaning I don't have much air leaking from the outside in through cracks in my house. Our ACH50 blower door test number was 1.5. So not SUPER tight but nowhere near a passive house

I did record a 13 minute video going into a lot more detail. If anyone wants more info on other air quality numbers like VOC's and CO2 levels, and more about the specifics of my house. Here is the video.

General advice for those affected by wildfires from someone who studies air quality routinely,"* outdoors
   * wear n95 mask
      * does that mean 5% of particles get through? no. it means they are tested for the most penetrating particle size of 0.3 microns and guarantee *at least* 95% reduction for those particles, although it's typically higher. Real life scenarios are even better as their lab tests ensure non polarized particles, which get trapped less easily. Particles above and below this size are filtered with higher percentages, down to roughly 10 nanometers (the sizes of viruses). The small particles are filtered better unituitively, because of a phenomenon known as Brownian motion. The electrostatic properties affect these light weight particles more and they move around more erratically and get trapped more.
      * Make sure you're wearing it with the strap and have a good fit and seal, especially around the nose bridge.
      * p100 is HEPA essentially. 99.97% of particles at 0.3 microns.
   * check the air quality on sites such as [airnow.gov](https://airnow.gov) for government sensors near you and hour/s long averages.
      * and [purpleair.com/maps](https://purpleair.com/maps) for realtime 10 minute averages and a very very large network of sensors for greater spatial resolution (fancy talk for there likely being a sensor closer to you than a government sensor). Turn on the EPA wildfire switch for more an adjustment to the models that more accurately reflects wildfire pm2.5 concentrations.
      * note that the smoke in your area can quickly change so long as the wildfires are ongoing and depends on current weather conditions (winds especially), so look into the canadian wildfire reports for planning.
   * do I need to be worried about VOC's and gases from the wildfires?
      * likely not unless you are near the source of the fire, within hundreds of meters or feet. these disperse very rapidly due to various atmospheric phenomenon such as nucleation and condensation (gases -> ultrafine particles (pm 0.1) -> pm2.5 -> pm10).
      * you can verify ground level concentration of gases such as CO, NO2, and SO2 from public monitors websites such as: [https://www.iqair.com/us/usa/new-york/new-york-city](https://www.iqair.com/us/usa/new-york/new-york-city) (pick your city, scroll down to 3rd section on page, under Historical). This might only be available for major cities.
      * n95 and HEPA does not filter these. gases are much smaller than PM. 
   * what about ultrafine particles? (tldr: n95 and HEPA filters this)
      * these are particles less than 0.1 microns in diameter, possibly the most dangerous as they can enter the blood stream. Smoke releases this and it's incorporated into estimates and models for pm2.5.
      * what is pm2.5? it means the mass of particles 2.5 microns or smaller within 1 cubic meter. this includes everything below and including 0.1 microns theoretically, but it's often not measured by most sensors, including the outdoor government sensors. Most sensors go down to 0.3 microns.
      * ultrafine particles are in fact filtered by n95 masks and HEPA filters. it's just that the regulations and testing is done on 0.3 microns, because they are the hardest to filter sizes.
   * what about driving?
      * put your car on recirculate mode and close windows
      * your cabin air filter (non-hepa) will filter anywhere between 20-80% roughly, but continue to draw down the pm2.5 concentrations up to a point where the leakages of pm2.5 from outdoor air counteract that.
      * you can also get a HEPA filter for your cabin filter. BOSCH is a company that makes it. Note that you will likely need to raise your fan speed a couple notches if you want to get the same air flow as you did before.
* indoors
   * close windows and doors
   * use a HEPA filter purifier
      * I recommend checking online available of local stores nearby to pick up a unit rather than waiting to have one shipped.
      * no need to spend money on the more expensive units. More cheap purifiers (e.g. one in each room, near windows and doors) work a lot more effectively than one expensive purifier for the entire apartment or house.
      * try to avoid ionizers as they can release ozone, but if you already have a small one in your HEPA purifier, it might be fine. Double check the product sheet to verify that the manufacturer tested only small amounts of ozone are released.
      * do not run an ozone generator.
   * a merv filter for HVAC will also help
      * you can also look into a corsi-rosenthal box for a cheap temporary air purifier.
      * be careful about merv limits for furnaces as air blowers may not allow anything higher than merv 11 or 13. your air blower can easily burn out with a HEPA filter installed, if it is not rated for HEPA.
   * you can wear your n95 mask indoors too (everyone is familiar). take breaks if needed.
      * if the air feels stuffy and you feel light headed, you can try taking bigger breaths temporarily, to increase your tidal volume and increase the displacement of CO2 in your mask's dead space.
   * I recommend getting an air quality monitor to confirm
      * one that has CO2 is a plus, although a separate unit is fine too. +1 for NDIR as it is more accurate.
      * well known models are IQAir (has an NDIR CO2 sensor) and Purpleair. But there are others.

   * Do not trust the auto mode!!!
      * most sensors on consumer air purifiers use MOX based gas sensors, which do not detect particulates. If your sensor does not report pm2.5 concentrations, then assume it is a gas sensor. To verify, you can try burping or farting on the sensor. This releases gas, e.g. methane and VOC's.
      * Why on earth would they do that? I don't know, but I know MOX sensors are far cheaper to mass purchase and don't require replacement beyond 2 years very roughly speaking (depending on environment).
      * I recommend turning up the fan speed on the purifier while the wildfire smoke outside is of concern, and placing near windows and doors.
   * Won't the air quality indoors be bad if I seal the windows? Won't it be stuffy and won't I be trapping in the CO2?
      * Well, yes the CO2 will definitely increase, as well as VOC's that can offgas from furniture, paints, and gas cooking, and human breath, etc. However, the current understanding is that PM2.5 from the wildfires will be much worse for you at the current concentrations (esp. AQI 100+). You can learn more about indoor air quality and make adjustments for the long term, but closing your windows for now is the best recommendation for most people.
   * What about humidifiers? The air is so dry!
      * This won't purify the air, but you can run your humidifier, preferably with distilled or RO water, without added minerals. If you use an ultrasonic humidifier, you are strongly recommended against using tap water. A cheap and safe alternative is to hang dry a wet towel(s).
   * Cooking
      * Temporarily limit cooking that involves much smoke, if possible. Limit gas cooking, and prefer electrical appliances.",67,2023-06-08 02:06:03

Recommendations for air quality monitors/sensors for an apartment?,"Apologies in advance as this has likely been discussed here a few times - I tried to glean what others are using from the posts here but there were a few different tools/apps being used.

I rent an apartment and am trying to get much better about monitoring and dealing with my air quality. Is there a good recommended monitor / sensor for overall air quality? I’m about to get a good Conway air purifier / hepa filter too, and I’m curious to take a few measurements before I turn it on. I have a chronic illness that I’ve slowly realized is impacted by the air quality and I’m hoping this can be another tool to help manage that.

"Parents-to-be concerned about moving close to a highway (~1200ft/365m), but AQI readings always seem good?","Common sense dictates that the closer you live to a highway or busy road, the worse it is for your health, and obviously there are many scientific studies to back this up. Some sources recommend being at least 500ft away, some say 500 \*meters\* ... the most conservative estimates suggest that you are only safe when you put a mile between you and the nearest freeway.

&#x200B;

I'm about to sign a lease on a place that's roughly 1,200 ft from the highway, and I'm stressing out wondering if I'm making the right decision. I should mention that my wife is pregnant and will be entering the third trimester just as we'd be moving in—otherwise, I doubt I'd be making such a fuss about the air quality.

&#x200B;

I check all the different air quality sources, like IQAir, PurpleAir, Google ... but the readings taken right alongside the highway are not markedly different from ratings taken one, or even two miles away. Still, I know that the air there—and especially in areas where two highways intersect—has \*got\* to be more hazardous for your health, right? And yet the data I'm seeing doesn't corroborate that, so it makes me worry that I can't trust these sources, or ""AQI"" as a catch-all stat.

&#x200B;

I just want to know if I can trust AQI, if I can make my decision based on whether the AQI readings near my would-be home are in the green or not. All the readings I'm seeing at the moment in this particular city (in Northern California) are good, well within healthy levels ... and practically all the readings I see in the state of Texas (for example) are in the orange/red ...

Fragrance Pollution; anyone else?,"hey everyone! i'm a disabled asthmatic in a major US city who joined this sub to see if anyone was here for the same reason i am, which is unavoidable fragrance exposure in dense areas. i was surprised to see little discussion of it. i made this comment and realized it should have been a post, so i'm keeping the comment but making it a post too (ty for reading, OP and commenter of said post).

&nbsp;


fragrance VOCs are a large chunk of urban pollution in the US, yet they are rarely included in articles about such. i realize some of that is just plain old suppression by the companies responsible for said pollution, but i think it's also because a lot of people are simply unaware of the issue, in between heavy marketing suggesting you stink if you don't have 5 step laundry fragrancing routines, and the fact that some people are anosmic to the main chemical groups, and others may just be lucky enough to live in places where exposure is rare. since these fragrances have made me very ill, i am trying to raise the issue whenever i can, as much to see how many others are suffering in the same situation with nowhere to turn as to gently educate that there is a general problem.

&nbsp;


there are so many unregulated chemicals falling under the label 'parfum,' and laundry products are far more numerous and highly scented than they used to be. i was surprised to see so little discussion of the issue on this sub. mabe most here have well sealed houses with good hvac? but so many folks are apartment dwellers in dense areas with no hvac, and that means fragrance from all sides plus above and below, and perhaps so much all through the neighborhood that even fresh air walks to escape for a little while are impossible.

&nbsp;


every article that IS about fragrance shows someone spritzing a bottle of perfume inside, but dryers run for 30-45 minutes outside. it's like someone fogging chanel no. 5 for almost an hour if it were made of cheaper stronger ingredients designed to stick to things and reactivate continuously for up to a few months. that would be the microencapsulation almost all laundry and cleaning products are now using. almost every detergent has been reformulated, and the scent infused into things that never would have had a scent in the first place. it's not just perfume in the classical sense so much as it is everything else.

&nbsp;


some studies have shown that up to a third of urban VOCs are fragrance, and it has been estimated (by the van teams that have driven around doing this type of study which is apparently prohibitively expensive and one of the reasons this is not better studied or known) that it may be 50% or more post pandemic and brand-wide formula change.

&nbsp;


this stuff coats EVERYTHING outside, and in a dense neighborhood where dryers are running constantly, it becomes all you can smell outside, even if the dryers are silent for the moment. one musk was found in over 90% of the great lakes samples in one study, and others show it makes pollinators unable to find their flowers. this issue alone could be a second (or third, as nauseam) silent spring. it's an increasingly widespread issue and a lot of folks just aren't aware of it yet. there's a lot of money for p&g etc. in making sure it stays that way.

&nbsp;


a conservative estimate from my mentally collating everything i've been researching over the past two years is that at least one third of americans experience detrimental health effects from exposure to these products, and more become sensitive by the day. it can get to the point where offices, public transit, stores, even visiting family and friends can become impossible. the office environment is the one place i see discussion around, because it's the clearest place in which ADA can apply. i wonder how many people (kids especially) need to get sensitized into MCAS and MCS before someone with political clout sees it matters enough to be a part of their platform.

&nbsp;


so who here bought an air quality monitor because of fragrance pollution in their homes from outside? anyone? i'd love to know if that's why anyone besides me is in this sub.

Measuring SO2 and NOX - Any Reliable/Affordable Options,"Hi All, I live near a major shipping channel, within a few miles, and for about 5 months/year the winds carry any pollution from the marine traffic right to my door (ugh).

Given the reputation of marine emissions, nitrogen and sulphur oxides are the biggest concern here beyond the normal measurements of PM, VOC etc.

However, despite all my research it seems difficult to find economical options (say <$500) that can reliably monitor theses pollutants. I feel like I must be missing something, but even searching this subreddit hasn't been helpful. I would like to get something that retains calibration for several months, so I may make IAQ measurements when the wind is both blowing from and away-from the shipping channel.

High PM2.5 readings - 300-500 range - advice requested,"We recently purchased a Germ Guardian AC9400W air filter, which happens to have a PM2.5 sensor. We live in southern Utah, so we were aiming to control the dust. But we were surprised to see PM2.5 indicator spiked to extremely high numbers (in the 300-500 range). I picked up a cheap air sensor on Amazon ([https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDFHJPQ2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDFHJPQ2)) which confirmed these readings.

We're unsure where the particles are coming from, and would appreciate some advice as to how to track down the source.

Outside air is great, and we've had the windows open for a while to lower the particle counts. However, as soon as we close the windows levels creep back up - I'm now seeing numbers in the 50-100 range and I imagine they will keep going up. The only thing we've found inside the house that seems to be impactful after walking around with the air sensor is to turn off a couple of humidifiers we're running. That seems to lower the numbers a bit. Maybe water vapor is being detected as PM2.5? Seems weird.

Anyway, I'm hoping this is all some kind of anomaly, but I am worried. Home is from 2018, some furniture is new-ish as of last year, paint and flooring from a year ago... and nothing in the house seems to be spiking the readings in close proximity. So we're kind of baffled. Any advice would be welcome.

warning about the Sensirion SCD40/41 CO2 Sensors,"Hi all,

I wanted to share a warning about the Sensirion SCD40/41 CO2 Sensors. These sensors have an auto-calibrate mode that takes the lowest CO2 level from the last week and assumes it is 400ppm. This can cause the sensor to read hundreds of ppm off if it is in a room that doesn't get to 400ppm of CO2 in a week. It's important to be aware of this issue, as some scientific papers are even using this sensor and haven't noticed the problem.

To turn off the auto-calibrate mode, all you need to do is send a 0x0000 command to the 0x2416 I2C register with a 0x81 check byte. You can save this setting using a 0x3615 I2C command.

Despite this issue with the auto-calibration mode, I still believe that the Sensirion SCD40/41 CO2 Sensors are a great choice for measuring indoor air quality. In my experience, they have proven to be much more accurate than other popular sensors such as eCO2 sensors. It's important to be aware of this particular limitation and take the necessary steps to disable the auto-calibration mode, but overall, these sensors are a reliable and effective tool for monitoring CO2 levels.

I hope this information is helpful and can prevent any issues with these sensors in the future.",40,2023-04-24 23:34:57
High initial CO2 readings,"I set up an Airthings View Plus a few days ago. A few of the readings have been calibrating, but one that has been consistently high is CO2.

I'm wondering if this is something I should be alarmed about or if this will go down after time.

We live in a large house with what I assume to be plenty of ventilation. We leave our back door open once or twice a week for a few hours at a time.

Initially, I had this in my office and had my door closed. It is the furthest from our HVAC system, so the last couple days I have been opening the door, forcing the HVAC fan to run, and even set up a box fan that blows into the room.

We live in Florida and have a relatively new home ( 2013 ). All of our appliances are electric. There are two adults, one child, and two dogs in the house. I'm just not sure what could be causing these high levels.

Weird headache in new house?,"Hi everyone! My husband and I just bought our first house and we are very excited about it… however every time we go visit the house I get a weird headache that seems to disappear once we are gone. I do not normally get headaches so this is kinda freaking me out. It feels like a tension headache in the back of the head where neck muscles meet the head muscles, but even when I try to massage it while in the house it doesn’t work. I do get these when I look down too much. 

Inspections came up completely clear before we bought - there was some “nonactive fungi” in the crawl space that they said not to worry about… is that the reason maybe? We are prepared to encapsulate if we need to. When they inspected it was cold outside and the percent humidity was negligible but now it’s definitely getting hotter and the humidity in the crawl space is closer to 50%. One of our hygrometers says 70%… (but it’s a shitty $6 one so maybe that doesn’t matter?).

The house does smell like chemical cleaners and fragranced laundry detergent so maybe it’s that and just needs to air out?

Would love any advice you have because it’s freaking me out and dampening my excitement for the house. I have an autoimmune disease so I am sensitive to things.

Worth noting that we currently live in an apartment with an active leak (though we haven’t seen any mold growth) and I feel fine no headaches. 

Also worth noting the house we bought has all underground utilities. Is that something? 

please don’t tell me it’s all in my head :)",7,2023-04-20 18:07:16
A fresh take on air quality monitors - feedback wanted,"Hello!

Over the past couple of years I've been working on a new air quality monitor after feeling the effects of poor indoor air quality during lockdown. What I found when I originally looked at current monitors was mostly bland, uninteresting products which were too data heavy and not often results orientated, so my plan was to reinvent what an air quality monitor could be.

The goal was to make air quality monitors engaging, easy to understand, but most of all, smarter.  What came out of this process was ""nooku"" -  a product I hope will compel more people to care about their indoor air quality by using AI-powered actionable insights and advice to help people create a healthier home.

PM2.5 includes air pollutants that are typically present in low concentrations but have toxic characteristics that may result in health effects from exposure even at low levels.

Ultrafine particles are particulate matter of nanoscale size (less than 0.1 μm or 100 nm in diameter).  Regulations do not exist for this size class of ambient air pollution particles, which are far smaller than the regulated PM10 and PM2.5 particle classes and are believed to have several more aggressive health implications than those classes of larger particulates.

Some PM2.5 particles are OK -- healthy even -- for example, ocean salt spray and water droplet mist.

But PM2.5 particles can be toxic, including engine exhaust, road dust, cigarette smoke and emissions from biomass burning and heavy industry.

So, clearly, all PM2.5 particles are not created equal: we need to measure particle composition to know the health risk.",7,2023-04-15 02:10:22
Findings from measuring air quality in my house with my PM0.1 capable sensor,"Around a month ago, [I asked here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirQuality/comments/113a94d/sensor_to_measure_pm01_or_less/) if there was a sensor that measured particles less than 1 micron in size. u/sadjadtj subsequently [alerted](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirQuality/comments/113a94d/sensor_to_measure_pm01_or_less/jaitwxs/) me to Piera System's sensor, which for around £200, I thought was worth a punt.

Here's a graph I made to demonstrate the effectiveness of the sensor:

https://i.imgur.com/WKVdjop.png

(Bear in mind the masses are cumulative, so PM5.0 covers everything 5 microns in size OR SMALLER. The PM5.0 curve was very similar to the PM1.0 curve, so I removed it).

The sensor did an excellent job in showing the 'clean' filter (used in a large HEPA filter machine, running at full speed) did indeed clean the air by a factor of around three, at least for the PM0.1 and PM1.0 particulates (not sure why the PM0.3 curve didn't improve so much). Unfortunately, it was unable to pick up the 'subtle' smoke odour that was emitted from an alternative old second hand smoky filter that I used in my filter machine (caused stingy eyes, and coughing even after 15 minutes).

I have a feeling that the extremely fine smoke particles fall in the region of 0.01 microns as this [Wiki infographic shows](https://i.imgur.com/GJuKSgb.png), hence why the sensor isn't picking it up, as it only reaches as low as 0.1 microns.

Humidifier that isn't ultrasonic in eu?,"Hey,

I was wondering if anybody had evaporative humidifiers recommendations in Europe. I tried to find one but most of them were industrial. 

I bought an ultrasonic one and my PM2.5 readings jumped from 0-1 to +28, I read that I can use distilled water but I'd rather not as its somewhat expensive. (I use a waveplus to read the PM 2.5).

My area is very dry, the humidity levels were at 15-17% before adding a humidifier.",4,2023-04-07 15:26:21
We need better air quality exposure monitoring,"Existing air quality metrics - AQI, PM2.5 - measure only the particle size and there is no information on composition. PM 2.5 could be salt spray, pesticide aerosol, or particles with toxic metals -- there is no way to tell the difference based only on size. Data on composition is essential to determine the health impact.

Exposome: DNA sequencing technologies have accelerated research. However, genetics has been found to be the root cause for only about 15% of diseases, with the balance due to environmental exposures and interactions between genes and the environment. There has not been much progress in the collection of exposure data in the past hundred years. We still rely on dietary surveys and coarse geographic sampling at the level of zipcode. To determine root cause and eventually prevent disease, we need better environmental exposure monitoring.",6,2023-04-05 04:21:41
Bosch BME688 gas sensor and AI fingerprinting of specific VOC'S using just a MOX sensor.,"Anyone else look into this?

brain dump of what I learned recently,"* Many air purifiers use MOX gas/VOC sensors, and don't detect particulate levels. This is not ideal as their auto modes do not increase fan speeds when particulate levels are high. An example purifier that operates like this is the popular Winix 5500-2. This was confirmed to me by Winix.
* Most total VOC sensors out there on the market for consumers are MOX gas sensors. They will work fine for most people (explained in bullets below), but are definitely not precise tools. If for some reason you need more precision, look into electrochemical or PID sensors. You'll need to shell out a lot more money.
* Ambient/outdoor VOC's in my area in Los Angeles are typically very low outside, unless you're very close to a source. Indoor VOC levels are much higher for me, and this seems typical based on all I could find on the internet and research papers.
* Ventilation is a quick and easy way to reduce indoor VOC levels. Just a crack in the window brings them from 0.200 ppm to 0 within a few minutes. Carbon filters don't work that well. I have one with several lbs and it can only decrease the concentration by about 10-30% and must be running 24/7.
* Cracking the window open a bit might be difficult for many people depending on location. If particulate levels are high outside, I still crack them open, and run a purifier in each room. I have been able to keep the concentration to near 0 as told by my air quality monitor. You don't need a fancy purifier. I use the 5500-2 and usually run it on level 1 or 2. 
* The other benefit of cracking the window open a little bit is that CO2 drops down to the ambient outdoor levels. I have found this to be much more convenient for me than opening and closing the windows wide open multiple times a day to ventilate. This might be more difficult for some people depending on their environment and weather. I highly recommend ventilation if possible. I've found it easier to concentrate and the air feels far less stuffy indoors since I started ventilating.
* It's very difficult to completely eliminate VOC sources indoors as nearly everything with a scent is likely a VOC (typically). I have made a post about this before. My general impression is that one should just focus on the more likely unhealthy sources of VOCs as there are likely many less harmful sources of VOCs. Example of unhealthy are perfumes, new furniture, lead paints, etc. Examples of ""less harmful"" are our own breath, plants, ground coffee, fruits, etc. Keep the levels of VOC's down to reasonably low levels and ventilate if/when possible.
* Carbon filters won't work for most vehicular and emissions exhausts gases such as CO, CO2, NOx's, and SO2. You might want to try looking into Potassium Permanganate and/or Zeolites. But this is expensive and might not be worth it. I haven't seen too much reliable information out there regarding the performance and maintenance of these types of adsorption materials over time on these gases and long term health impacts. Much more information is on particulates.
* Masks work very well to block particulates. P100 performs as well as HEPA and n95 does a pretty good job with being more convenient and easier to breath through. I recommend wearing masks when the air quality is poor outside or you are near vehicular emissions.
* If you heard of ultrafine particles, then you might know these might be the most damaging because they can lodge deep into your lungs and affect more of your body and brain. Fortunately, n95 masks and HEPA filters do a great job of filtering these even though they are far smaller than 0.3 microns due to a physical phenomenon called brownian motion. Note however, that this does not mean that gases will be trapped by these filters. They are not.

Note: many of these are based on my own personal experiences and have my preferences baked in. Any advice gleaned here should be fitted to your own situation and verified.",35,2023-03-22 18:52:07

VOC Sensor,"Greetings ...  

Also Posted this question on Airthings community.

Here is the VOC sensor description from Airthings website:

""The  sensor response depends on the mix of compounds in the air, and its   output is scaled to give the most correct reading for one common mix of   compounds (the VOCs that are in our breath). But if the mix of VOCs it   sees is different than this, its output might be significantly off.  ""

My  Airthings View Plus VOC reading varues between 100-900 ppb, while my  two (2) Temtop M10 varies between .04 - .12 mg/m3.  No cooking,  chemicals etc.   Reset View Plus, via taking outside in clean air every  week.

Any thougths about human breath making readings different ?

NO2 levels spiking indoors with windows open,"A couple of months ago, I purchased a uHoo indoor air quality monitor. It has reported that the NO2 levels in my house have been between around 0-40 ppb.

Feeling miserable in my own home - allergy like symptoms,"My family and I are feeling miserable inside our own house to the point that we are thinking about selling the house. We love the neighborhood and the house, so we are desperate trying to fix the issue. We are experiencing allergy like symptoms (runny and stuffy nose, dry burning eyes, air feels dense). It is affecting my wife the most, but my daughter and I are definitely feeling it a as well. It seems to be worse on the second floor of the house. Some days are better than others and some days feel like a nightmare. We also notice excessive white dust even though we are always cleaning, never seen so much dust in previous homes. 

We bought the house about 3 years ago. The house was built in 2002 and is located in South Florida. The previous owner was an elderly couple who kept the house in really good shape. As soon as we moved in we ripped out the carpet on the second floor and install new Lifeproof Vinyl flooring and new pine baseboards. The first floor has tiles so we left it alone. I cannot recall exactly when we started to experience the symptoms but I don't remember any symptoms at first. About a year ago we also replaced the HVAC system because the old one had failed, we were already experiencing symptoms before and after the AC was replaced. We also replaced the Washer/Dryer which are on the second floor right next to the Air Handler and Master Bedroom. I have cleaned the vent that goes through the attic to the roof.

I have checked for water leak and mold throughout the house but I could not find anything at least that is visible. I decided to hire one of these Air Quality Test companies and they came out and tested 3 of the rooms in my house as well as the outside. The test did not reveal anything out of the norm that would be alarming. 

I bought 2 Shark Air Purifiers for large rooms, that seemed to help maybe a little at first, but now I dont see any difference. Maybe I should clean the duct next but I am very skeptical of hiring a good company. I bought some cloth filters on Amazon to temporary cover the AC vents just to rule out dirty AC vents. I covered the vent on the master bedroom where we think it is the worst, but that did not make any difference. 

I am running out of ideas, we are supposed to feel good at home and this is not the case at least for me. Any advise you can offer I would greatly appreciate it.",27,2023-03-01 16:22:15

Renter-Friendly Air Exchange Options?,"Hi everyone,

I live somewhere where the outdoor air quality (mostly PM 2.5 and ozone) is consistently problematic year-round. It's particularly bad during the winter (air stagnation) and late summer (wildfires). I'm asthmatic and hawkish about having clean indoor air (3 HEPA purifiers and counting!). Ever since I read about the WHO's stricter guidelines for PM 2.5, I've found myself more and more resistant to opening the windows. I very rarely do so when the AQI is above 25. 

I've recently become more cognizant of indoor CO2 and have started using an Aranet4. Whenever I first got it, my indoor CO2 was nearly 2000 ppm! Needless to say, my strategy of keeping all the windows closed and just spamming air purifiers isn't sustainable. At the same time, it's bewildering to open the windows and watch the CO2 slowly decline as the PM 2.5 steadily climbs. Especially during the winter with air stagnation, opening the windows often means getting a huge, terrible whiff of gas leaf blower and car fumes as well.

I can live with compromising on indoor temperature (bringing in cold air in the winter, hot air in the summer) but would love to have a way of bringing in fresh, filtered air and more rapidly exhausting CO2. I know a cross-breeze would be ideal for this.

Are there any renter-friendly options that would be effective for this? I'd be interested in something like a filtered window fan.

If the best I can do is just run my purifiers on high with a cross-breeze and go through their filters much sooner, I can live with that, but I'm really hoping there's something out there that would fit my needs. If not, there should be!",5,2023-02-23 04:57:40

"Is there a brain dead way to find out if the ""activated"" carbon on my filter has expired?","I've just bought what I thought to be a great cabin filter for my car. It cost enough. However, I find the fumes enter the cabin more than ever.

I'm wondering if the activated carbon isn't actually active any more. Or maybe, the filter design is just too 'holey', or maybe the air is seeping past the sides of the filter. Thing is, I just don't know.

So I was really hoping there might be a way to test the carbon. Maybe dip it in some kind of chemical, and if there's a reaction (or lack thereof), that shows the carbon is active. Or maybe use a microscope somehow.

When carbon isn't active, does that simply mean that there's too many ""pollution atoms"" sticking to it, or could it expire in another way, where it simply isn't as... 'magnetic' any more.",5,2023-02-22 23:02:25

I’m sorry but I do not have a deep understanding of air quality. I’m just asking questions to try to understand new concepts.

Indoor AirQuality 101: Aranet4 va AirThings,"Hello there, I'd like to monitor the air quality of my house. I do not want to use my WiFi connection, so all data consultations have to rely on Bluetooth. I'm completely new to the topic so any hint is a big help.

After a review, I identified Aranet4 and AirThings View Plus. Here are my thoughts on that:

Aranet4:

* (+) best reviews over the internet
* (+) very compact and portable
* (+) accurate and precise (almost like a pro instrument)
* (+) nice app
* (-) just focuses on CO2, Temp, Humidity and pressure

AirThings View Plus [https://www.airthings.com/view-plus](https://www.airthings.com/view-plus)

* (+) focuses on much more indicators (all the Aranet4 data + Radon, VOC and PM 2.5)
* (+) nice app
* (-) precision is debated, as well as long-term performance. Some reviews are quite concerned about such factors
* **(?) not sure about how the Radon sensor works. Is this safe or is it going to store radon particles throughout time, becoming dangerous?**

I'd really like to hear from you experts some hints about it. Feel more than free to highlight other solutions, if you think that those can fit : )

Update on 2000+ voc levels in bedroom - it’s a doozy,"Past 24 hours have been a roller coaster.

I’m gonna level with y’all - Up until now,  my running theory was that my mattress was poisoning my blood at night… just so you get an idea of my mental.

However, just to be sure I wasn’t full on cuckoo, I had a mold inspector come over - especially considering how much my symptoms line up with mold poisoning.
We checked every nook and cranny of the basement and the attic. A little lumberyard mold here and there, and signs of previous water seepage, but no signs of any active growth… nothing even worth testing to send to the lab. damn. Must be the mattress I told him. To his credit, his “yeah.. I guess it could be” was half-believable.

Now at this point, the levels in the bedroom had lowered down steadily to about 1200 by morning. So I had gone in and moved the voc monitor to a different room upstairs - check what was going on there. Levels were about 650.. must just be calibrating still I thought, but I’ll let it sit and see where it lands.

About 4 hours go by - I’m in the basement workin away - doing a great job of distracting myself.. and finally, I remember to check those voc levels. See if it’s finally calibrated down to a reasonable level, so I can get a baseline.

“1700”.
Fuck.

Open up the graph - see that it was on a comedown from a peak of 2000+.
Fuck fuck fuck. It’s everywhere, what the fuck.

Looking closer, on the graph are two distinct peaks, both with rapid spikes to 2000 and then gradual descents back down. Granted it’s a sample size of 2, but it’s better than mattress theory. So, I start trying to figure out why tf these chemicals shot up so fast and so high.

Then it hits me- the mold guy suggested I do 1 thing as he left: run the fan some more and get a bit of fresh air in the house. I interpreted this as “crank that HVAC to the tits, ASAP”. I reference the graph, and sure enough, that was about 20 minutes before the voc spike. I start sprinting around, checking every single vent, exhaust pipe, gas outlet I could find. I was absolutely convinced there was a gas leak or CO leak that the alarms were missing. With the heat and fan now off the voc levels were dropping even faster. Great! Love it, but what. tHE. FUCK IS HAPPENING. I am getting dizzy and reality starts to get a little wobbly as I run around the house huffing god knows what kind of fumes are being let out. This is the chance to really prove I’m not crazy, and maybe just maybe fix it.

Im thinking it has gotta be the HVAC system, but I can’t find any issues with it. No cracks in the ducts or gas pipes for the furnace, and no issues around the permitir of the house. My panic starting to abade as the levels continue dropping, so I start searching the HVAC’s manual online, hoping for some sort of clue. In the manual for the blower, I come across a warnings that reads “replace filter every month. Do not let any moisture get into the filter or blower system”.

This has legs - I know for a fact, that filter sure as shit has not been touched in at least a year.
So I shut that puppy down, opened up the filter cover, and prepped for the moment of truth. What I pulled out was the most heinous I’ve ever touched. A soggy, old, and black mold covered paper filter. 

Relief hit so hard - I finally had a solid answer that didn’t leave me feeling like a nut. About 3 seconds later he dizziness hit even harder. This thing was rank. After catching my breath outside for a good 10 minutes - I went back in with a respirator, bagged it up, and took some pictures for you folks back home.

Without further adieu:
https://imgur.com/a/6zscq4p/

What’s next? Not sure - the HVAC repairman comes tomorrow - time to find out what happens when you send mold spores through the main arteries of a house and into every single room… for months on end. I also have a new mold guy coming tomorrow just to see how deep this goes in the ducts. I’ll be sure to update tomorrow! 
What a ride, thanks for joining

Three nights of PM2.5 spikes,"About three weeks ago I purchased two Temptop M10i’s and have one unit placed upstairs and the other placed at ground level of my home.  Typical baseline levels of PM2.5 are around 1-2  ug/m^3 and can rise a bit when cooking. So far, the data has tracked pretty well with my perceptions of what’s going on in the house. 

For the past three nights, both monitors have registered a significant spike starting around 8:30PM and peaking around 11PM.  One night maxed at 110ug/m^3.  At first I suspended something related to the furnace, however, I can not see any correlation between its activity and the PM2.5 reading.  I have an Ecobee thermostat and have exported the data from that and the Temtops to compare.

Does anyone have any ideas on what to investigate next?",6,2023-01-18 23:36:23

Outdoor Air Quality Monitor for Highway Pollution,"Hi - I'm a resident of Austin, Texas, where the state is planning to expand a large highway going through the city's center.  


There are a lot of public schools very close to the highway, and I wanted to do some research about the current air quality at/near those schools to help inform the local community about the negative impacts on the students there - especially when they're outside of the building.  


I'm a fairly technical guy (I've got a degree in engineering), but by no means an expert on air pollutants. I'd like to get a portable outdoor air quality monitor, to be able to take measurements near the schools, to see if there are currently any health risks to the students there.  


I'm trying to determine what sort of outdoor air quality monitor I should purchase for this, and I have a couple questions:

* What type of pollutants should the community be most wary of, especially near a highway?
* Are there any particular outdoor air quality monitors that people would recommend to measure those pollutants? I'd like to stay below $250, but could probably go a little higher if necessary.

Air scrubber issue?,"My husband and I own 2 houses. House A is completely remodeled. It is a 1960s stone ranch with a basement and about 2 years ago we completely gutted it, removing everything inside except for the studs. When the house was close to finished we started having air quality issues (headache, cognitive issues, sore throat, etc.) and couldn’t move in as planned. After a very long discovery process, we found that our custom-built cabinets tested high for formaldehyde. We have since removed the cabinets and the air quality has gotten a lot better, but still isn’t 100%. 

We purchased House B and moved into it recently. We found mold in one of the bathrooms. We had some general handymen repairing the bathroom. They used a shop vac without a hepa filter when working. We were concerned so we ran the air scrubbers (BluDri Air Shield 550) we were using in House A. Since then, we have been having similar symptoms and the air quality where we ran the air scrubbers isn’t great. Not sure if it is just coincidence since this is also where we are having the mold issue.  

Is it possible that the air scrubber actually did more harm then good by bringing in formaldehyde from House A into House B? When we first ran it we hadn’t changed the filters in the air scrubber. Since then we have wiped it down and replaced all the filters in it. We have continue run it on it off, but the quality in the impacted rooms is just not right.

Hydroxyl generators (and Winix Plasmawave),"Anyone have any experience with these? The science sounds reasonable. Is it safer than ozone as commonly suggested?

I'm mostly curious about VOC reduction as this isn't handled by HEPA filters. While activated carbon filters can remove some of the VOC's, the real stuff is expensive and require frequent replacement as they become saturated far more quickly than usually advertised.

It sounds like one of the drawbacks with Hydroxyl generators are that they take a while to act. [This page](https://cleanfax.com/science-and-technology/generating-pure-air/) suggests multiple days for a home. But what about inside a car, if one is driving in heavy traffic behind tailpipes?

Does anyone have any information on Winix's Plasmawave? I found [this information](https://www.ausclimate.com.au/article/what-is-winix-plasmawave), but would like to know what quantities of hydroxyls are released.

"Metallic Smell Causing Dizziness, Sinusitis, Headaches - What is it?","Has anyone encountered a metallic, almost sour smell that makes you feel disoriented/dizzy?  We lived fine in our apt for months and then suddenly, one cold night in our bedroom, we began to smell this weird metallic smell that made me dizzy and nauseous. It eventually inflamed my sinuses and gave me vertigo. I imagine it was super concentrated to cause such an immediate effect and we only smell it in the bedroom, specifically it was around my bed. We've pretty much stayed out of the room and kept the door closed shut and stuffed things under the door to keep the air from coming into the living room where we've been sleeping  with an air filter but we need to figure out what the heck it is and the source because we still occasionally get affected by it in the living room (but to a lesser degree) and have to open the windows to air it out.  One thing we've noticed is that warmer air helps keep it at bay and makes us feel better too.  Just wondering if anyone has had any experience with this particular smell or has any advice.

Some things to mention that we think might be the cause of it but aren't 100% sure...

1. We had a house fire a couple years ago and still have some furniture from that event. It has been cleaned but we've read about the toxic fire particulates and how it's pretty hard to get rid of and causes issues. However, this doesn't explain why for months, we lived with these things in the bedroom and were relatively fine until that cold night.
2. There was some construction outside and the exterior stairs and some wood beams for the apt were replaced around this time. There was a lot of cutting wood and banging/hammering on the building but it all occurred outside. They have since finished.
3. We bought a piece of plywood and put it under my foam mattress for additional support.  It had been there for 2 weeks without any issues before that terrible night. We've since removed the plywood to be safe.  We also threw out my foam mattress because it had absorbed the strong metallic smell in the room.  Despite all this, the smell is still coming from the room. The living room and bedroom is carpeted. We are fine in the living room right now with the carpet but am wondering if the bedroom carpet absorbed the stuff and is still emitting it?  

For the first couple days after this event, we tried opening the bedroom window for hours to air it out but it doesn't take long for the metallic smell to return and for us to get dizzy, have inflamed sinuses, dry nose, headaches, etc.  There was just no way to be in that room without the window open but because of the super cold weather, we couldn't keep the window open all day and night.  Does anyone have any experience or advice with this? 

Eventually, we plan on going to go back into the room with a full face respirator mask on and disposable coveralls and see if we can remove or cover things with plastic sheeting to narrow this darn thing down.",3,2022-12-27 23:40:25

Question regarding air particles from humidifiers,"Let me know if I am posting in the wrong subreddit, but I think this might be the place for it.

I recently started taking air quality measurements at a relatives place using an Airthings View Plus device. Everything looked to be good for some time, with Radon, PM2.5, PM1, Co2, VOC and temp all being within normal ranges. However, I noticed that humidity was an issue (falling down to 17% on some days), so I invested in an ultrasonic humidifier for their place.

Fast forward, and shortly after receiving the device and setting it up I noticed that PM2.5 and PM1 levels started increasing. In fact, the levels went from <10 μg / m3 to 30-45 μg / m3.

At first I didn't realiy think much of it as I know the humidifier is spewing out a lot of very small water droplets into the air, and I figured the reading were likely high because the sensor was picking up on the h2o particles.

But I Googled this eventually, and found that ultrasonic humidifiers have a tendency to also spew out the minerals and chemicals found in tap water, which could also significantly increase the particles found in indoor air. I'm a bit puzzled by this, because there is a ceramic filter in the device, and it also uses a plamsa function which uses electricity to create both positive and negative ions (deactivating viruses, mold, etc). But I also read it could have an effect on dust.

We live in a place with pretty good tap water, no harsh treatments or anything. I guess my question here is - are these readings anything to be worried about? Could it simply the water droplets causing for the readings to spike?",20,2022-12-20 20:22:59

Additionally, we just did a renovation and have been taking out carpet, tore down a wall, and in general, created a lot of dust. It’s so hard to breathe in here. It’s feels unhealthy.

Grease/Oil in Air due to cooking,"My roommate cooks with a ton of oil/grease (lots of frying of foods), and my room is located directly above the kitchen.

Adding a breathable bag of activated carbon to a cansiter-design air purifier,"Filtering VOCs in the air requires a lot of activated carbon. Unfortunately, most air purifiers have paltry amounts of carbon in their filters. The air purifiers that do come with significant carbon cost $600+, and their filters tend to be $250+. Examples include Austin Air, Airpura, and IQAir.

There are some cheaper air purifiers that have a canister design (BlueAir 211+, Levoit Core 600S).

Inside the canister, there is plenty of empty space even after putting in the filter.

**Approach 1:**

Buy a bag of activated carbon, put it inside a breathable cloth bag, and place that cloth bag inside the air purifier filter.

Notice how in the attached picture, the Levoit Core 600S has plenty of empty space inside the filter.

**Approach 1** **Concerns:**

The airflow will essentially go around the carbon-filled cloth bag if placed inside the empty space in the filter. I'm not sure if this will be effective despite being able to hold over a pound of carbon.

The other concern is that carbon dust can directly escape the air purifier without any filter in between to catch it, although I don't think that is likely if the carbon pellets are inside a cloth bag.

&#x200B;

**Approach 2:**

Note how there is some very slight room around the perimeter of the air filter after inserting it into the air purifier. Instead of putting a bag of activated carbon inside the filter, I could alternatively put some carbon pellets on the outside perimeter of the air filter, resulting in forced airflow through the carbon.

&#x200B;

**Approach 2 Concerns:**

The carbon pellets would have to be large enough to not fall out of the holes of the canister in this particular model. Perhaps a pre-filter similar to the BlueAir 211+ that wraps around the outside of the air purifier can help with preventing the carbon pellets from coming out of the holes. Also, I won't be able to fit much carbon around the perimeter of the air filter because there's not much room.

&#x200B;

**Question:**

Do either of the 2 approaches seem like a good way to filter VOCs in the air cost-effectively?",11,2022-11-30 02:42:01

Toxic house syndrome?,"I live in an old 1930’s house. I started renting 8 months ago. Literally the week after I moved in I had my first panic attack.

The last 8 months my health has steadily declined, mostly neurologically. Even my girlfriend has suffered some memory loss and other issues. We have some grandchildren come over a couple times a week and now one of them in starting to stutter.

I seriously think something in this house is killing us.

We have water leaks in the bathroom through the subfloor. Bathroom has no vent fan. That’s being fixed soon. The landlord put so much wood floor stain upstairs that you can still smell the off gassing 8 months later. That’s where I sleep. Also, I’m wondering if this house has lead paint.

I’m really debating on paying someone to come in and run test on this house or stay at a hotel and see if my health improves. I’m definitely leaving this place in February when the lease is up. 

If I find something before that I’ll definitely breach this contract.

Why am I sensitive to VOCs?,"I don't get it. Is this genetic? How come other people don't seem to be affected as much? And yet there are studies proving that multiple chemical sensitivity is not real. It is not recognized by science and the medical community as a real condition. 

I don't have an issue with other chemicals. It's always unfinished fake wood like MDF/plywood releasing formaldehyde, plastics made in China, or polyfoam.

For example, I bought some Adidas sandals, and of course, they have the ""new"" smell. I left them outside the whole day. I just let them inside, it's been 15 minutes and I can feel it in the air, the VOCs, the smell, and making me feel a bit odd, funny feeling in my throat, etc. They have that ""cloud foam"" technology which is nothing more that cheap ass polyfoam

I put them outside again and opened the windows, the smell in the air is gone and I feel normal again

And yet, with other chemicals I don't seem to have an issue which surely release VOCs as well.

Does this mean I'm sensitive to some particular VOCs or it just so happens that these cheap products like plastics, fake wood, etc release higher levels of VOCs so almost everyone gets affected in some shape or form? Some people don't seem to be affected by VOCs at all, which only makes you feel like a weirdo for being the one affected by them

I had issues with Ikea furniture. I bought several pieces which I had to return all of them. They all smelled and released VOCs and yet with other furniture I haven't had issues. I've realized I'm sensitive to formaldehyde

My current desk is MDF. I never had issues with it, turns out, is Greenguard certified, I didn't even know it was, which is certification of low levels of VOCs, which explains why I never had issues with it despite being MDF.

Same with my mattress I bought a few years ago, never had an issue, is from Serta and apparently they use low levels of VOCs and are made with eco-friendly materials

How long does it take for chinese plastic to off gas or stop smelling?,"I bought some studio monitors speakers. They’re made of aluminum the outside doesn’t have any smells. The only plastic outside is the power input and XLR input and other little plastic behind a metal cover

If i put my nose next to it, there is a chinese plastic smell ive encounter in the past. I opened the speaker but not much of a smell inside them.

I left them open in the living room to air out. What smells the most is those little plastic pieces which are power input and other input plastic that was covered by the plate which im sure these little pieces are Chinese

Chemical sensitivity is not a real thing,"In 2021, Quebec’s public health agency, INSPQ, issued an 823-page report commissioned by the province’s Ministry of Health and Social Services on the state of knowledge about so-called “multiple chemical sensitivity” (MCS). The report includes an exhaustive analysis of more than 4,000 articles in the scientific literature. It is written in French, but one-page and four-page summaries are available in English

https://www.inspq.qc.ca/en/publications/2730
https://www.inspq.qc.ca/sites/default/files/publications/2730-multiple-chemical-sensitivity-syndromect.pdf


An exhaustive analysis of more than 4 000 articles in the scientific literature led to the following findings:

Over the past two decades advances in neuroscience and the availability of new techniques for measuring biological parameters and performing functional brain imaging have shed light on the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying MCS. These developments confirm that the psychological, biological, and social aspects of MCS are inextricably linked.

Affected individuals perceive odours as a threat to their health. When they detect odours, they experience acute stress symptoms that manifest as ailments that they attribute to the chemical products associated with these odours.

This cascade of reactions triggers and perpetuates biological changes in the normal functioning of the individuals’ immune, endocrine, and nervous systems.
The nervous system is impacted mainly at the level of the limbic system structures involved in emotion, learning, and memory.

Collectively, the observed alterations explain the chronic and polysymptomatic experience reported by those suffering from MCS, which includes alterations in mood and cognitive functions, sleep disturbances, fatigue, loss of motivation, and the inability to feel pleasure. As a result, affected individuals are also more susceptible to the development of a variety of physical and psychological problems.

These alterations are not specific to MCS. They are also reported for chronic fatigue syndrome, posttraumatic stress disorder, electromagnetic hypersensitivity, fibromyalgia, depression, somatization disorder, phobias, and panic disorder.;. All of these disorders have in common is the presence of chronic anxiety.

Chronic anxiety helps explain all of the symptoms of SCM syndrome. The same alterations and dysfunctions are found and measured there.

Over the long term, the nearly unavoidable recurrence of these acute stress episodes in these individuals leads them to develop neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and, inevitably, chronic anxiety.

Based on these new insights, the authors of this report rebut the hypothesis that there is a relationship between MCS and the toxicity of chemicals present at normal concentrations. Nonetheless, the chronic biological disturbances observed with this syndrome, the severity of the symptoms experienced, the social and professional repercussions, and the high prevalence of MCS in the population, qualify it as a real health issue.

Given that those suffering from MCS are, to varying degrees, genuinely ill and that their condition would justify appropriate medical and social support; the authors favor the establishment of centres of expertise specializing in MCS, as well as the continuation of the scientific monitoring of this syndrome.

This scientific advisory report is intended for physicians and healthcare professionals who will encounter MCS cases, for researchers in this field, and for MCS patients and their families.

MCS proponents suggest that the immune system is like a barrel that continually fills with chemicals until it overflows and symptoms appear. Some also say that a single serious episode of infection, stress, or chemical exposure can trigger “immune system dysregulation.”

Many people diagnosed with “MCS” suffer greatly and are very difficult to treat. Well-designed investigations suggest that most of them have a psychosomatic disorder in which they develop multiple symptoms in response to stress.",5,2022-11-06 20:51:06
Developed a severe anxiety disorder after moving into rental.,"So basically I moved into a rental 8 months ago. The first week moving in, I suffered a major panic attack. I never had these before.

The week before I moved in the landlord was putting varnish all over the wood floors. The upstairs has a wood stained ceiling and floor. My mom noticed an extreme paint smell while visiting. I obviously got used to it and didn’t notice.

So after suffering severally for 8 months and my health steadily declining, my mom mentioned recently that maybe the paint smell is causing the issues. You can still smell it upstairs where I sleep. The room has tiny windows, so very little ventilation and it gets hot up there.

I’m starting to wonder if VOC’s are still gassing off. It would be an extreme coincidence that I’ve never had health issues until moving in here.

I think the air in my house is making me sick but not able to find anything yet,"I started getting sick 8 years ago when we moved into a new house.  I had some health issues before that though.  It started with fatigue and sinus pressure.  Did sleep studies, etc and nothing.  A few year later vertigo started.  The fatigue keeps getting worse and now have bad brain fog.  Had 2 sinus surgeries already.  Have had a couple mold inspections with nothing that really stood out.  I did an ERMI and it was a 4 and the HERTSMI was a 4.  A couple of air tests done and they were all pretty clean.  HVAC didn't work good controlling humidity so had to replace it about 6 months ago.  

There was mold in 2 of the supply boots that have been fixed now.  It was tested and was cladosporium.  New HVAC works much better with controlling humidity.  Stays about 45%, ranging from 40-55% throughtout the day.  Old HVAC would sometimes get as high as 60-65%.  New HVAC is variable speed.  I have done 2 urine mycotoxin tests and they were both negative.  I did  a couple mold plates and highest count was 5 colonies.  Nothing conclusive yet.

I have reflux too since 2004, GERD.  I now have Barrett's esophagus.  So I don't know if all my symptoms are from mold or reflux/stress.  My kids also have symptoms but not sure if from mold or stress from me and my wife fighting because I am very irritable.  8yo has some bruxism, nasal congestion and tired eyes.  5yo has weight loss, irritability and tired eyes.  2yo has tired eyes and not wanting to sleep through out the night.  

Wife just has weight gain and hairloss but that could be from her thyroid issues, pregnancy or stress.  I can't afford more testing or inspections.  I know of one really good inspector that would be my last resort but is $1,300.  I could do an OAT and GI-map test but that would be $900.  I have a lot of functional labs done already.  I do have high cortisol.  Feels like I just don't get enough sleep.  I wake up exhausted.  Not sure if from reflux or mold.  

Maybe a VOC test I can do myself?  Maybe it is VOCs since I can't find any mold.  I've seen the one's for $200 that are DIY.  The professional ones are $1,000+.  Maybe another ERMI + Endotoxin + Actino?  Mold plates again but send in for analysis?",9,2022-10-26 16:57:56
VOC readings,"We have a temtop sensor that we’ve been using for 3-4 months. lately my partner and I have been coughing etc and so we’ve been monitoring the air more (we have air purifiers and able to keep PMs pretty low).

It seems to be recording SOMETHING, but we don’t have any recent painting, staining, etc. or even new furniture other than a green guard certified crib, which I can’t imagine is filling the whole house. We don’t smell anything!

I've been getting a very bad smell on and off for the last two months from somewhere in the house. The smell was giving me a headache so I got the house professionally cleaned and got a levoitt purifier too. 

Today when I came back home from work I got the horrible smell again( it smells like something died) and i checked the air purifier monitor and the indoor pm2.5 had spiked to 395ug 5 hours ago and is only now reducing. No one was home for the last 8-9 hrs so I'm not sure what could have caused a spike this high.

VOC monitor question (new to this),"I recently got an Air things wave mini to monitor my Voc levels. I know it takes seven days to calibrate but I wonder if anyone else has had this experience.

After setting it up, the first few days were between 46-280 ppb. Then after the heat was accidentally turned on to 72 the Voc number skyrocketed between 600-1200. 

So then I open some windows and turn on the whole house fan to clear out the air, and then the levels shoot up to 2700ppb. We have very good outside air. 

So then I took the device outside to see what it would read where we have very good outdoor air, and the monitor read 1500 ppb after 4 hours outside. 

I put it back inside and the number came down a bit but has settled at 1000 ppb. 

Anyway, this has been the first five days of Voc monitoring. Is this normal during the calibration period?

Air quality app that reports based on WHO air quality guidelines?,"Hi all,

I live in Portland, OR and have become very interested in air quality over the last few years with the fires, temperature inversions, “cottage core” folks burning wood for heat, etc. deteriorating our outdoor air quality almost year-round. 

I have asthma, seasonal allergies, and a chronic condition that puts me at greater risk of having cardiovascular issues, so I’ve been trying to take this quite seriously (and have considered moving). My windows and doors are well sealed and I run an air purifier in each room constantly. 

I recently came across [this article from IQAir](https://www.iqair.com/us/newsroom/2021-WHO-air-quality-guidelines) comparing the WHO’s AQGs to US AQI and found it quite compelling. This also resonated with me as I had long thought that AQI in the moderate range was alright for me to go on a long walk or jog only to end up feeling terrible, short of breathe, phlegmy, and stuffed up with a sinus headache. 

I quite like the IQAir app and appreciate having its widget on my home screen so I can quickly check the air quality. However, I feel it would be best for my health, especially as someone who likes to exercise outside, to go by the WHO AQGs from now on. 

Are y’all aware of any apps that go by those instead? I would like to recommend one to my friends and family as well. 

Any other advice related to air quality would also be appreciated, as I’m still somewhat new to this space and imagine I have a lot to learn.",9,2022-10-05 18:34:39

Small babies and small particles,"My partner and I have a brand new infant. 😍We’ve been reading up on air quality / pollution studies and have noted a lot of disturbing info on PM2.5 particles, no surprise to anyone here I’m sure. 

I totally believe the studies but my question for folks on here is how y’all think about it or address these results in your daily lives. Rn in my area it’s mostly “good” or “moderate” PM 2.5 conditions according to the EPA. However, I know the WHO adopted significantly lower standards last year… plus it would not be surprising if the EPA rules were compromised in some way, and I’m not sure if the EPA is truly considering tiny infants.

Partner and I are in agreement that smoke from forest fires etc would mean mostly staying inside and running air filters.

But in terms of edge cases… let’s say the AQI is 45 (just below the EPA level for “moderate risk” but above WHO levels) for PM2.5 how do you all handle this? 

Also, not sure how to compare minute to minute readings vs the 24 hour or annual averages that are used for WHO guidelines. I don’t want to panic just because the level goes above 5 ug/m3 annual average or even the 15 ug/m3 24 hour average, but we also want to take the data seriously. 

I don’t think there’s any one right answer, but I’m super curious how y’all weigh the health risks vs freedom to go outside, open windows, etc.

Sudden VOC spikes in couple of rooms,"This has been driving me nuts. I have been monitoring VOCs in my house using Airthings for over a year now.

There are two rooms where all of suddenly VOCs will spike up and then drop down.

I searched any possible source and cannot find anything that could emit.

This happens year round (does not seem to be related to other factors such as temperature, humidity, etc) but is most observed during winter and summer when we keep windows closed and rely on heating/cooling to circulate air. 

What you see below is from earlier today. The Bedroom 1 was vacated around 8am and nobody walked into it since . The spike started around 5:30 am when there was 1 person sleeping but the spike is not consistent with any movement in the room.

The first image represents VOC sensors in the entire house and the second only for the room in question roughly for the same time period with all other measurements.

Any pointers how to narrow to the potential source of these is GREATLY appreciated.

Are Sensibo AirQ TVOC/CO2 measurements making sense?,"I bougtht Sensibo AirQ, which has additional sensors for TVOC and CO2 in addition to sensors of Sensibo Air. Now I'm wondering if the measurements are legit at all, and does the sensor have a very bad quality.

Most of the time, TVOC stays at 0...20ppb, but suddenly there are high (about 2000ppb) spikes at random time instances. The spikes seem to be evened out by some low-pass-filter. Similarly, CO2 jumps from 400ppb to 2500ppb at exactly the same time instances. I don't think my home has such CO2 bursts suddenly, and these indeed disturb the readings. At those spike instances, the app sends a notification about bad air quality.

TVOC consumer grade,"Hi. 

I have been dealing with massive allergies in my house for about 2 years now. I bought a cheap air quality sensor from amazon and that showed massive TVOC values inside my kitchen (especially the wooden cabinets). All the rest of the house was within safe values.

However. When I tested it again for the next few days, i never found significant TVOC values again. I assumed the VOC sensor was unrelliable and returned it to Amazon.

Have you had any good experience with a cheap amazon TVOC sensor (<300€)? I know they are not as precise as professional ones. However, a air quality technician charges around 1000€ for one visit.",9,2022-07-20 10:56:59

But from what I've seen.. products like Airthings Wave Plus or Temtop's monitors are really not consistent. You can buy two of them, put them side by side, and they give completely different readings.

I'd rather take the $300 I spent on that and just put it towards a $1000 Air Purifier that I know will at least do something rather than give me false positives or negatives all the time.

Are we being scammed?,"Sorry in advance for the long wall of text. Recently learned about off gassing and got worried because our furniture is cheap quality, and our apartment building is just a few years old. We haven’t had any health effects as far as I know, and although our apartment definitely has a smell I can detect when I leave and enter, it’s not what I would consider a chemical smell and seems no different than any other home insofar as every home has a unique smell. None of the furniture smells as far as I can tell. Nor do the walls, floors, appliances, etc.  

We have a first generation Dyson air purifier, which I’ve read is more fan than air purifier, and we use it as a fan. It’s supposed to detect air quality, but it has always said the air quality is good. That is until the other day when I popped off  the cover of the sensors to inspect whether the sensors were dirty. They weren’t, but then it said for the first time that the air quality was poor. After running it for a few minutes, it said it was good again. I turned on continuous monitoring and since then it’s been pretty inconsistent.    

Not thinking the Dyson was reliable, I ordered a $100 tester off Amazon. The tester detects particulate matter, formaldehyde, and tvocs. I went outside to calibrate it; however, I live downtown in a major city, so I’m not sure if the calibration was accurate. It said not to calibrate near a lot of traffic, but that wasn’t really an option. When I used it inside, the particulate matter was negligible, but the formaldehyde got up to around .18 mg/m3. The tvocs were showing at over 3 mg/m3. I opened the window for the first time in weeks because I always figured the air quality outside is worse than inside where we live, particularly because our ac has heavy duty hepa filters, and the formaldehyde dropped to .05 and tvocs to around 1. I closed the window after a few minutes and the formaldehyde remained at .05 overnight but the tvocs went back up quickly. 

The next day, we decided it was worth having a professional come check. We used a site that connects you with someone who can provide the home services you’re looking for. For $100, a guy came over, but I was a little skeptical because he works for an air purifying company. We would have preferred someone more independent. He walked around the apartment with a monitor and claimed our tvocs were 25x what’s considered safe. He narrowed in on and probed a wall connected to our closet and bathroom and said that’s the likely source. His theory was that our wall has a lot of moisture trapped in it, which allows the tvocs to thrive. Although he answered the 200 questions I asked, I couldn’t help but pick up on his subtle and sometimes not so subtle sales techniques. His solutions were a VERY expensive oxidizing wall spray or a VERY expensive air purifier. He “conveniently” had another job nearby tomorrow and said because we’re nice he’d leave an air purifier with a charcoal filter overnight and then pick it up the next day when he’d test again to show us the numbers went way down.     

This seemed like a scam to me. I’m a hypochondriac, and I’m worried sick I’m going to get cancer from long term exposure to chemicals. We’ve lived here a year already, and I spend all day in my apartment. I’m anxious that if this is a real problem, then real damage has already been done. I also understand that this  industry could be preying on my anxiety.    

I’m not sure what more we can do to find out if we actually have a problem, and I’m wondering if anyone else has similar experiences or advice.",6,2022-07-08 04:15:19
House still smells of paint one month,"We had our house painted with Dulux and Berger Gold Label low sheen acyrllic paint one month ago.

How to get home tested for unknown air quality issue? (UK),"I have posted previously about allergies in a new home (not new just new to me).  I won't go back over all of the info but I would appreciate any advice on what options there are (UK) for a broad air quality checking?

Since shortly after moving to my current home I have been suffering with severe eye allergies. I have seen several optometrists and ophthalmologists along with having various allergy tests and the consensus is allergic conjunctivitis, cause unknown. I have it under control now only via steroid drops but this is not a long-term solution.

I won't go into war and peace on everything but the key headlines are as follows:

* Symptoms started about 4 weeks after I moved in and have never stopped, nor has there been any seasonal variation,  as I type this the worst symptoms are under control via the drops but I can see that the underlying imflamation is still there.
* I have had somebody in to test for mould. I was disappointed with how comprehensive their testing was so whilst they reported lower level indoors than their outdoor sample I have still not ruled it out.
* I purchased a couple of Amazon and an airthings air quality monitor all of which are reporting regular spikes for VOC and less regular spikes in PMQ 1 and 2.5. No idea what is causing these spikes nor do I know if I can consider them relevant or not.  There is no regular pattern.
* I have an intermittent nasty smell in my main bathroom and to a lesser extent kitchen. I had somebody in to look at the drains and they found and cleared out a couple of partial blocks, standing water and some nasty stuff. I thought this might be it but a few weeks on the smell has returned.
* I live on an island that was once a naval dockyard, all evidence points to a non-issue but it cannot be ruled out. So long story short it could be inside or outside the home or it could of course just be unfortunate timing and a coincidence.

What I would like is to have someone come in and do a broad test of all possible causes but having researched I am not sure that such a person or service exists and do not want to throw good money after bad. I did put my house up for sale but the market is not great and ideally I like to stay as I like where I live but I am at the point where I really do not know what to do, all I know is that this cannot go on.  Is there a Doctor House equivalent for this stuff????

Any advice much appreciated.",3,2022-07-04 14:45:30

Ideas for fresh-air intake set-up in a rented apartment !,"Hello everyone,

I live in a rented apartment in Central Florida. The apartment is not large for the number of people living. Since modern energy-efficient apartments don't have as much ""leakage"" of fresh air into the conditioned space like older ones did , the CO-2 concentration goes above 1200 ppm very quickly. The apartment has vinyl floors and VOC's seem to spike during morning hours too.  
I know there are dedicated fresh air intake systems that can be integrated with the HVAC. However, I would not be able to do that in a rented apartment. The next best option I could think of is a window fan with a HEPA filter to remove dust and pollen installed in my bedroom window. I could turn it on to draw in fresh air when both the outside temperature and humidity are low enough. Here are a few things I'd want :   
1) Strong enough airflow that'll pass through a HEPA filter  
2) A nearly airtight seal when the fan is not operating so as to keep out hot and humid air  
(some vents that close and open possibly)  
3) Although not a requirement, programmable operation based on external temperature and humidity would definitely be a plus.

Are there any products out there that do this already ? DIY suggestions are welcome too!   
 I've been learning about indoor air-quality recently. So, any inputs or suggestions are greatly appreciated.",4,2022-06-15 22:42:58
What is causing this brown water in my dehumidifer?,"Hi guys

\[Pics at bottom of post\]

I live in a 2 bedroom flat in London.  I suffer from cystic fibrosis, so having good air quality is important to me and also my flatmate. We moved in about 6 months ago and noticed there was some visible mold in the bathroom... no real shock there. We bought the strongest anti-mold spray online and sprayed it maybe once every month. It seems to have reduced in size and from what I've read, just spraying it with this strong stuff will make it omit much less spores.

&#x200B;

We also bought disposable dehumidifers for every room so that the air isn't overly moist for mold. This is where my problem lies. I just went to change the dehumidifiers in the living room and my bedroom and the difference between them is quite staggering. The one from my bedroom (on the left) has dark cloudy water with brown 'bits' in it. Seeing this has really worried me as to

a) what in the environment of my bedroom has made the water so dirty? For reference, I put up both dehumdifiers at the same time roughly 1 month ago. We've been using them for maybe 5 months and have NEVER seen this before.

b) why is it only in my bedroom? The other dehumidifiers have collected completely clear water

&#x200B;

The only notable change in the house is that we had holes in our attic. This caused squirrels to get in which meant a pest control guy had to come, and then builders who had to solve the numerous holes in the roof. While doing this they created LOADS of dust and it was right outside my window. Could the colour be due to dust? Whilst I see this as a possibility, it seems strange to me that the other dehumdifiers were  not affected given they are in the room next to me and the windows are often open.

&#x200B;

I have a high allergy to the air borne fungus aspergillus, so this kind of stuff really worries me and stays on my mind-particularly because it is where I sleep.  :( Apologies for the long message and any thoughts I would be truly grateful xx

&#x200B;

Best tools for assessing overall air quality of US cities and counties,"I'm looking for places to live and am wanting good ways of comparing overall air quality between places, an aggregate over the course a recent year.

Are there simple explanations to understand and predict the changes in air quality outside?,"I have recently started following the air quality measurements in my area (The Netherlands). For these past days the PM2.5 is usually below 6 µg/m3, but today it shot up to 13 µg/m3. I can see in the map ([https://www.iqair.com/air-quality-map](https://www.iqair.com/air-quality-map)) that the PM2.5 shot up through London, Belgium, and the Netherlands. I am curious about whether these are changes that can be understood - or even predicted - using data easily available. There is a lighting storm predicted to happen today - could the condensed water droplets be causing these high readings? I also see that there is a fire going on near the center of the zone where the PM2.5 levels increased, but I see many fires happening through the map and these do not seem to have such a large effect. I am asking because I am curious about whether it is possible to acquire some good intuition about what the air quality will behave like, or to know if these changes are simply too chaotic to try to reason.",3,2022-06-05 12:34:43

Remodeled home VOC levels maxing out AQ reader at 9.99mg and cannot figure out source - please help!,"My husband and I just spent the last year remodeling our home. We gutted the place and replaced everything. We also added two additions and a number of custom built MDF cabinetry. I tried to be careful to use low VOC/greenguard/CARB compliant materials for flooring, glues, paints, sheetrock, wood etc. We finished construction in March and the first day we moved in I had an immediate reaction - burning eyes, headache, throat irritation, dizziness. We bought an AQ reader on Amazon and were shocked to see how high the levels were. We eventually had to leave and now we are at a loss trying to locate the source. 

What we’ve done so far:
-Open windows. We left every window open for three weeks straight. As soon as we closed them it immediately went back up. 
-Duct and post construction cleaning. 
-Air purifiers with charcoal filters. Helps brings levels down to around 4mg when running.
-Bake out for 5 days at 90 degrees. Made no real difference.
-Tested for radon. Levels were at 5.1 which is higher than the legal limit in our state but doesn’t seem high enough to be our problem. 
-ERV. We just installed an ERV system this week out of desperation. It brings the upstairs levels down to 3mg but the first floor is still at 9mg. 
-Planning to check for gas leak this week but don’t smell gas. 

We spoke with an environmental specialist who seems just as baffled by the high number as we are. While we understand new materials would elevate the levels while offgassing that number seems excessive. It also seems strange to me that the entire 3,000 sqft house would be showing the same VOC level despite different levels of remodel in each room. The only thing that every room has the same is paint and flooring. 

Does anyone have any thoughts on what could be causing numbers that high? Could it be the combination of materials? Could the MDF be the culprit? Any thoughts welcome as I’m at my wits ends with this!",4,2022-05-29 14:23:05

I am currently leaning towards the PurpleAir PA-I-Indoor as it seems to be a trusted brand, has a broad range of particulate counts, and has CO2 sensor. Other one I'm looking into is the IQAir AirVisual Pro which I've heard from coworkers is good and I like that it has a display.

From the first article, ""The most frequently found contaminants in the Meeker Avenue Plume include tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene, cis-1,2-dichloroethylene, and vinyl chloride — chemicals and gases commonly used in dry cleaning fluid, brake cleaner, metal degreasers and to produce a stiff plastic called polyvinyl chloride (PVC). These chemicals are now wafting their way into the basements of Greenpoint’s homes and businesses, as invisible carcinogenic vapors. The National Cancer Institute has linked exposure to these toxic materials with kidney, liver, brain and lung cancer, as well as lymphoma and leukemia.""

Does anyone know how effective the Mila would be at both monitoring and filtering out any of these VOCs?",5,2022-03-28 20:14:17
Recommendations for a non-internet connected outdoor air quality sensor?,"Hello! 

I reached out to Davis Instruments the other day to find out if their AirLink outdoor air quality sensors could be used locally without an internet connection and unfortunately received the following reply:

>The AirLink device is a cloud based sensor which connects to your local wifi internet and uploads data to our WeatherLink.com cloud.  You would not be able to direct access the device through your LAN.

I also received a similar response from IQAir on their outdoor unit. 

Can anyone recommend an outdoor air quality sensor that at least covers PM2.5 and preferably PM10 measurements with a basic indoor display or local LAN capability?  

Thanks!",6,2022-03-28 13:58:02
Are there any studies showing any relationship between health and lower levels of particulate pollution?,"By lower levels of particulate pollution, I mean even low PM and AQI levels that we typically consider ""good"". e.g. an AQI of 49 is still considered ""green"", but I wonder if that's actually pretty bad if that's what you breathe on a daily basis. There are some studies showing that ultrafine particles lower than PM2.5 can be damaging to the brain and cardiovascular health. 

I find myself coughing a little bit even at PM2.5 @ 10 ug/m\^3 or more, an AQI of approximately 20 or 30. I don't have asthma. Caveat: it could just be that I'm sensitive or allergies or street level pollution that the public air quality monitors don't capture. Regardless, I'm here in Los Angeles where AQI 50 is average, and the moment it drops to 49, people see ""green"" and think it's a good air quality day. ",7,2022-03-25 18:29:37

I have been measuring air quality in my home and I need some help. The results I have been getting are confusing.,"I have been monitoring the air quality inside my home here in the UK: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lfhvmEw408On84Stnhiwl4Jg0IjxYuBzhcM68P41bSw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lfhvmEw408On84Stnhiwl4Jg0IjxYuBzhcM68P41bSw/edit?usp=sharing)

I have noticed that the levels of particulate matter concentration were often not good. I tested the difference opening a window for 10 minutes twice a day would make in two different locations (our kitchen on the ground floor and a bedroom on the first floor).

What is confusing is opening a window twice a day seemed to worsen the level of particulate matter concentration in the ground floor kitchen, but improved the level of particular matter concentration in the upstairs bedroom.

It's possible that these results are mostly down to outside particular matter concentration conditions i.e. the pollution level was just higher for the time period I tried opening a window twice a day for the kitchen. But I'm still confused.

**My question is: Should I be opening windows twice a day only on the first floor? That seems counterintuitive to me because surely more fresh air should be better for inside air quality than less?**

&#x200B;

Notes- Gaps in the record: I used a Temtop M10 air quality detector to get my readings. Unfortunately this required me to manually take readings four times a day so some days I was just too busy to manage it four times a day.

Edit (2022/Feb/17): Adding that I live in the UK

Sudden Reaction to Basement Room Air,"Hello! Please feel free to let me know if I should be asking in another sub. In any case, I greatly appreciate your time. 

Back in July over the course of a weekend, I developed a reaction to a corner basement room in our home. The room is finished and has two windows going out to window wells in it. During that time, the humidity did get high and we also had a groundhog that had gotten under our paver patio which is near that side of the house, but there is no plumbing in the yard on that side as far as I know. I remedied the humidity situation right away and got rid of the ground hog. Nothing else substantial developed during that time. Along with the allergic reaction I have to the room, there is occasionally a smell that does not smell like mold or musty. Hard to describe as it is not exactly a bad smell...but it's occasionally there either way.

Things I have done:  
\- had the fire dept come with equipment to test for dangerous gases  
\- used a borescope inside a large amount of the drywall and behind the insulation, which found nothing, though i did find a small amount of mold behind the baseboard - which is now gone.  
\- pulled up the carpet in that room - found nothing.   
\- had a plumber and hvac tech inspect the systems down there (ejector pump, shower, etc)  
\- gotten an allergy test which showed mild reaction to molds but major reaction to dust mites.  
\- put mice traps in various parts of the basement. I have never seen or heard any, but did find what looked like old droppings on a foundation ledge near that room and the allergy reactions to them fit.

I am the only one in the house having this reaction and able to smell the odor...headaches, fatigue, ear dryness are the major ones. I found a company near me called Indoor Science, out of Chicago, that does comprehensive IAQ and allergen testing. Does this seem like a logical next step? I thought your opinions might help before I drop a grand on testing.

Thanks again. Really at a loss on what to do for this outside of move.",4,2022-02-15 02:51:40

* PM25 is a must - has to be decently accurate
* VOC detection is a plus
* Hard wired power is preferred - don't want to be messing with batteries
* WiFi / app UI is a big plus, otherwise on-board UI must be readable from across the shop
* Data logging is a huge plus - I would like to track AQ over time with different dust removal configurations.

potential sources of TVOC,"if you're trying to reduce your indoor TVOC levels, I have the following things to keep in mind and recommendations from my personal experience and readings. Appreciate any feedback and suggestions.

keep in mind:

* please keep in mind that even fruits, like a ripe banana, will produce plenty of VOC's.
* not all voc's may be that bad, and research here focuses on a few that are common polutants, like formaldehyde or benzenes. there are hundreds of voc's, however.
* typically outdoor VOC concentrations can be close to zero PPB, and indoors can be much higher, with a reference points here.
* from my experience carbon filters, no matter how much carbon, will only last a short while and only eliminate some VOC's. they continue to do a good job of eliminating odors for longer, however.
* do an elimination test by removing things from your indoors and using a portable VOC monitor you can buy online for $50 - $200 USD.
* VOC's will likely shoot up significantly when you are cooking. you are combusting butane, chemically changing the structure of your food by cooking, and the released odors and gases are essentially VOC's. open your window and turn on your fume hood fan and turn on a fan.

recommendations to reduce VOC's, and potential sources that I've discovered:

* remove or seal food temporarily as a way to set a control for eliminations. you can add back later.
   * i'm not 100% sure if these are safe, but I'm going to just assume VOC's from food are safer than non-natural sources.
* use your nose as a guide. many VOC's have an odor, although some do not.
* try to get your VOC down to nearly zero, or less than 0.1 PPM. the lower the better.
* remove cleaners and other fluids that smell (nail polishes). try to switch to natural products and/or keep these sealed in containers. I use Dr. Bronners for almost everything now (cleaning and bathing), and my VOC monitor shows zero.
* newer furniture, esp. with fiberboards can offgas for a period of time
* remove rubber mats and rubber weights for gym equipment
* remove candles and other waxes
* remove air fresheners
* remove trash bags that have scents, and be mindful that whatever you put into your trash might be a source of VOC's. I recommend isolating food wastes from affecting indoor air quality.
* after you've removed things and if your VOC monitor is showing zero, you can decide what to introduce back or seal up, or put in the garage, etc...
* if your VOC's are still high, it could be paint, something in the walls or attic (insulation), or larger pieces of furniture, or curtains, carpeting, etc... you can research low or zero voc alternatives or renovations, and decide what's best for you.  


concluding remark 

* just because your portable $50 monitor says your VOC is 0, doesn't mean it actually is. It means out of the 10-30 VOC's that it can monitor for (check w/ manufacturer), none of those are being reported. These monitors are also not perfect in many other ways that's documented elsewhere. 
* again, use your nose. it can't detect all VOC's either, but it can be extremely useful. 

Hope this helps some of you. Let me know what your ""offgasing"" experience has been like :)",14,2021-10-27 19:58:37
What levels of CO2 are acceptable indoors? What about optimal?,"Seems like < 1000 to be safe from the following. But my question is that is less always better? 

>[Carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide) (CO2) is a relatively easy to measure surrogate for indoor pollutants emitted by humans, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are unusually high indoors may cause occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are usually 350–450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm.[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_air_quality#cite_note-30) Humans are the main indoor source of carbon dioxide in most buildings. Indoor CO2levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.  
>  
>To eliminate most complaints, the total indoor CO2 level should be reduced to a difference of less than 600 ppm above outdoor levels.\[[*citation needed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)\] The USA [National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIOSH) considers that indoor air concentrations of carbon dioxide that exceed 1,000 [ppm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parts_per_million) are a marker suggesting inadequate ventilation.[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_air_quality#cite_note-31) The UK standards for schools say that carbon dioxide in all teaching and learning spaces, when measured at seated head height and averaged over the whole day should not exceed 1,500 ppm. The whole day refers to normal school hours (i.e. 9:00am to 3:30pm) and includes unoccupied periods such as lunch breaks. In Hong Kong, the EPD established indoor air quality objectives for office buildings and public places in which a carbon dioxide level below 1,000 ppm is considered to be good.[\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_air_quality#cite_note-HongKongIAQ-32)European standards limit carbon dioxide to 3,500 ppm. [OSHA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration) limits carbon dioxide concentration in the workplace to 5,000 ppm for prolonged periods, and 35,000 ppm for 15 minutes. These higher limits are concerned with avoiding loss of consciousness (fainting), and do not address impaired cognitive performance and energy, which begin to occur at lower concentrations of carbon dioxide. Given the well established roles of oxygen sensing pathways in cancer and the acidosis independent role of carbon dioxide in modulating immune and inflammation linking pathways, it has been suggested that the effects of long-term indoor inspired elevated carbon dioxide levels on the modulation of carcinogenesis be investigated.[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_air_quality#cite_note-33)

>But a new Danish study failed to confirm these findings. [The paper](http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/human-responses-to-carbon-dioxide-a-followup-study-at-recommended-exposure-limits-in-nonindustrial-environments(15b475b7-73da-45f3-ba9e-c943bfac2754).html), published in February 2016 in the journal *Building and Environment,* reports no cognitive decline even when subjects breathed air containing 5,000 ppm carbon dioxide. Pawel Wargocki, a coauthor, says different measures of mental ability might explain the difference between his research and the other papers. His experiment gauged changes in brain power by asking subjects to copy text with a keyboard. Wargocki says typing accuracy might be a better test of ability to perform office work than the test used by Satish. He says he hopes that future researchers will compare the two measures side-by-side.  
>  
>Even scientists who have found an effect say more research is needed before they are convinced that modest amounts of carbon dioxide are a public health problem. Satish says that, so far, nobody even knows by what biological mechanism carbon dioxide might dim the brains of test subjects. “I would love to know,” she says.  
>  
>Nor does anyone know if the effect wanes if somebody breathes carbon dioxide at these concentrations for long periods. Or if carbon dioxide can subtly blunt the thinking of people breathing lesser concentrations – perhaps closer to the level in ambient air, 400 ppm. “It would be very important if true,” says Mendell. “It’s not clear yet.” Allen, the Harvard researcher, says his team plans follow-up experiments that could answer some of these questions.  
>  
>The amount of carbon dioxide in ambient air is still far below the concentration at which these studies suggest the gas might cause cognitive problems. But the level is increasing exponentially, propelled by unrelenting extraction and combustion of fossil fuels.

"Mold, AQI spikes and a newborn baby in a condo - help!","Hi All,

This is my first post in the community. My wife and I moved into a new apartment 10 months ago. We've had numerous issues including a sewage smell and found significant mold growth in our vents. We've resolved both issues at great expense and since then I've been trying everything I can to protect our health and that of our new born baby who is 2 weeks old.

Moving is not an option right now and frankly, lots of these issues exist at most residences in the city where I live (due to lots of dust, poor maintenance of pipes and high levels of heat + intense AC required to combat the 40-50 degree celsius weather = mold). I'll list the steps I've taken and humbly ask if anyone can suggest anything I may be missing to address these issues:

1. Hired a private contractor to remove all mold from our vents, install micro filters on AC units which we've had to replace very frequently (every 3-5 months) due to the accumulation of dust which actually prevents the AC unit from working
2. They placed these tea tree blocks which supposedly evaporate and reduce re-occurrence of mold growth. It's been 8 months since they've put those there and upon return visits and my own inspections, I see no mold
3. We bought 2 air purifiers from Dyson and put them in our living room and bedroom (where the baby sleeps)
4. The one in the living room will indicate mostly green (good) readings with the occasional spike when we cook or some other unknown reason, which seems to quickly resolve
5. **The newer one in the bedroom where our newborn sleeps next to us is almost always spiking in the yellow range and has a reading of 65 pm2.5**
6. I am trying to read up on what this could indicate and hopefully find out what I can do (aside from the recent replacement of filters and cleaning of vents) - no luck so far. Please let me know if you have any advice here!

Apologies for the long message and thank you in advance for your help!

Why reviewers get mad about varying air quality monitor readings,"Before deciding to buy an air quality monitor for indoors I stumbled over the same issue among all of them. People were giving bad reviews to all monitors because different devices or the same device in the same room would produce different readings.

But is that not to be expected? The air around us distributed particles differently and not homogeneous, so even a sensor a few inches apart would measure different particles in the air. To me it seems like it is an exaggeration of reviewers or is there a different aspect to it?

I ended up buying the Awair because they have fairly good reviews and knowing they have been in the market for some time I assume they went through several product iterations.",7,2021-08-23 02:10:59

* New Trane 2 Speed HVAC w/ Air Handler
* New Reme Halo LED In-Duct Air Purifier

* Previously installed Space Guard 2200 using New Carbon Aprilaire 213 Merv 13 Filters 
* Running 4 Winix 5500-2 Air Purifiers around my house.

I have tested my house repeatedly and removed mold from the list of concerns by having a licensed expert come and test 5 areas of my house repeatedly by taking air samples and comparing it to the outside air.

My goal is to identify that cause of the irritation as I am still in the dark as to the source.  I did purchase a Dylos 1100 Pro Laser Particle Counter but that hasn't shown a smoking gun.

My next purchase would ideally be something that measures CO2, TVOC/VOC, HCHO, CO, etc...  The problem is that I haven't found anything that is reliable with good reviews on amazon.  Can you recommend something that takes most of these measurements for under $1k that is reliable?

Poor Air Quality & Coway Airmega AP-1512HH,"We live in a single family home with a small child (no pets) about 20 ft from a somewhat high volume road. We both have dust allergies so we tend to keep the house pretty clean normally and we have a monthly cleaning service.

For Christmas, I decided to get 5 Coway Airmega AP-1512HH to use throughout the house. I was/am somewhat concerned about vehicle exhaust from the nearby road, was/am concerned about the global respiratory pandemic going on, and finally I figured some air purifiers would help with our dust allergies even if they did little else.

We've had them for about a month now, and as you can see in the screenshots there is a high frequency of ""unhealthy air"" (although the ""average"" is in the good range).  I have run the units almost exclusively on Auto, and they do occasionally step up their fan speed from the low speed to the medium speed so I assume these surges are what is being recorded. Is this information actionable in any way? If so, how? What am I supposed to learn from these charts? I feel like the Coway is telling me the air quality isn't good, when it's the device that is supposed to improve the air quality!

Related question, what exactly is the Airmega sensor measuring? I assume it can't do chemical analysis of VOCs. I'd be surprised if it somehow measured fine particulate matter. Does it measure ""normal"" dust in the air? I'm not sure what to make of that... Anybody willing to educate me?

NCCO for VOC removal,"After countless months of researching for a filter that reduces VOC effectively.  I know that activated carbon ins the standard but it's 2020 and the best filters we have is HEPA which was created in the 1950's.  We've made better improvements to the technology and it's a great option for PM.  However the thing it lacks is the ability to remove very fine atomic particles like formaldehyde, no2, and many other gases.  

I've set up a grow fan and that has ben quite effective but they get clogged up quick and start actuating outgassing originally caught in the carbon.  It's effecitive but short lived-- so I've looked int options such as PCO,PECO and AHPCO.  Molkule, dyson (cryptomic)  and all the various companies that make it.  I own my fair share of filters.  I do my best to look at the data and most of those listed are not great at filtering out GAS on the first pass.  It takes hours or half days to full remove it in a confined box.  As may of their studies show.  So they do work, but they work super slow.

Luckily, I stumbled up this interesting variation of Catalytic oxidation.  NCCO out of hong kong and this thing is impressive.  Unfortunately it is license to one brand westinghouse who is't well known for air filteration.   I did notice a bit of ozone at the start but once it got running my ozone stay cosistenly at ambiment  levels.  Not only that it was able to bring my TVOC ppb down to 0  in a decent amount of time.   

I have never seen my meter that low ever and I did pretty much seal off the room to make it controlled as possible.  The technology is pretty rad in that it confines the gasses and uses active oxygen to oxidize the particles.   Look into as it's just hitting the markets.  The hope is we can see more of these aound with different manufacturers.  It not very great at PM though, but I already got that covered.",12,2020-11-24 04:35:32

Looking for Air quality sensor with GPS,"Hi there,

For one of our projects we are looking for a sensor that measures air quality. The data we want to measure is at least the following:

* NOx
* CO2
* Finedust
* All other things are ok

Important! The sensor we are looking for should also be able to keep track of measurements locations with GPS so we can visualize measurement data on a map. Doesn't have to be connected to internet so data can be stored on the device.

So the purpose is to measure air quality in urban areas by getting data from bikers.

Does anyone have some tips for devices that might be able to do what we want?

Many thanks in advance.

kind regards,

Do I need to measure PM 2.5 and PM10 to accurately measure indoor allergens like dust?,"I have my eyes on an Awair Element , but it only measures PM 2.5.

**My purpose for getting an air quality monitor:** I  want to check to see if there's a lot of dust in the air when I'm running my HVAC system, and if my air purifiers are picking it up or not/generally cleaning the air well.

**The main issue:** when my heating is running (through HVAC system) and stirs up all of the dust -  I'm assuming maybe stuff from the furnace as well, as I try to Swiffer thoroughly beforehand so it's not stirring up stuff already there.

It's an old heating system and the air comes out at like a hundred miles an hour man which can't help

**My question**: Will PM 2.5 monitor everything I need? It seems like the best and most affordable home units out there, like awair or purpleair, only measure PM 2.5 and not PM 10 so I have to assume that this should be enough?

Thank you so much. 

My home is fine and comfortable aside from when I’m running the heating - my allergies are getting real bad when I have to.",4,2020-11-04 17:35:48

Plastic fumes,"I bought some electronics, and they're releasing a lot of plastic fumes. The smell isn't strong enough to make me dizzy or lightheaded, but the smell is noticeable, especially if I leave the room and walk back in again.

Can pm2.5 settle inside?,"Hi! So I’ve been pretty obsessed with our AQI inside the past few weeks (in Bay Area, it’s been a nightmare). Bought Indoor Purple Air monitor which admittedly has made me pretty neurotic. Bought a ton of air purifiers, fans  etc and was able to keep it pretty green/yellow inside while the air was really bad outside. But now that it’s been green outside, I can’t get it down inside. It has stayed in the 50-60 range even with windows open and very low numbers outside. 

I’m concerned but not sure what to do. With the house shut up and purifiers going it won’t drop below 50. So I’ve been keeping the house as open as I can instead, especially while AQI has stayed low outside. 

Can pm2.5 build up inside? If it has, what’s the best way to clean it? Or is it possible the monitor is reading high for some reason? When I put it outside it actually still stayed in the 50 range, again when it was green outside.

Thank you for any insights.",5,2020-10-18 05:34:19

Glad to find this subreddit,"I live in Kampala, Uganda. Air quality here has been a constant problem... It's nice to see a community here with people discussing this problem. Even more so now due to the wildfires in the western US. We use Blueair 411 air purifiers in our bedrooms at night, and have a monitor at home. Levels are typically between 100-200 AQI, sometimes more than that.

The problem in Uganda is that people burn. A lot. Trash is burned everywhere, and farmers burn their fields regularly. Some of our problem is geography as well, as there aren't enough fresh winds coming in to clear the air. Our best days are moderate AQI, I've only rarely seen levels go into the good category (maybe during a huge rainstorm).

"Estimating PM concentrations in terms of common units (PPM, ug/m3, etc)","There was a post a few weeks ago on how to convert units from PM counters to compare them against the units used in the AQI, NAAQS, etc. I am a professional in air quality and I thought I'd give a short primer on how to convert number of particles per liter (or ft3) to units of mass per liter (or ft3, m3) or ppm. Particle count per volume (N/V).

For starters, you're gonna need to right monitor if you want to compare what you have to the PM standards. In the US at least, there are standards for PM10 and PM2.5. Your monitor ideally should measure PM of that category.

Alright, so now you've have the right monitor and have taken measurements. They are likely in particles/L. While helpful, you really want the ug/m3. 

To do that you need the following info:
1. The average density (p) of the particle (g/cm3)
2. Average diameter (d) of particle (um)
3. Porosity (e)

You already have the average diameter (let's say 2.5 microns or  2.5E-06 m or 2.5 um). The average density is another matter. You'll have to look it up, but as long as it's a mass/volume, you're fine. For porosity, you can look up typical porosities (how perfect a sphere a particle is) or you can assume a perfect sphere (e = 1).

Once you have those three values, you'll do the following:
1. Calculate the volume (V) of the particle: V = e * (1/6) * pi * d^3.
2. Calculate mass (m) of the particle: m = p * V.
3. Calculate concentration (C) using the particle count per volume: C = m * N/V.
4. Convert the units to the desired units using the unit conversions.

Keep in mind that this is a rough estimate. The mass of particles is usually measured directly by measuring the weight of the filter and the particles collected (and subtracting by the weight of the filter).

Hope this helps and happy measuring!",6,2020-08-22 13:48:34

Elderly Dad's Cooking,"Hello!

Hoping you all could help me out here...

My 90-year old dad lives with us and we've converted the basement of the house into his quarters. We cook for him upstairs in the kitchen 300 days out of the year, but sometimes he insists on demonstrating his independence. He takes out a hotplate and, despite our pleas not to (we've got plenty of leftovers, always), he whips himself up something fried directly in his bedroom. 

My dad has ZERO ability to tell when his cooking is filling the room with too much smoke. In our previous house where he also lived in the basement, he had a full kitchen available to him and he frequently triggered the smoke alarms in the upper levels of the house because he was ""roasting chicken"" or something of that kind.

Yes, this is dangerous on many levels. He nods off while he cooks, forgets to tuns off appliances, burns things. Unfortunately, we've failed many times convincing him to give it up. He gets very upset when the smoke detectors go off and says they are far too sensitive, or incorrectly placed, etc. I'm sure you get the picture of this guy. Very, very stubborn. Nothing could be his fault. 

Last night I ran late in making him food and he decided to fry frozen spring rolls in a pan on his hotplate. 

I smelled something upstairs, went into his room, and sure enough, it was once again filled with smoke from cooking. He wasn't necessarily ""burning"" anything, but you could see the smoke in front of your eyes. It didn't bother him one bit. I asked him if he noticed, he said no. He was sitting at his desk on the other side of the room, writing something, not really watching the food. I opened the window and door to let the smoke out and he got very upset because it was too cold for him outside (about 20-degrees Celcius/68 Fahrenheit but he's old and doesn't have great blood flow, so he gets cold). Smoke detectors didn't go off. I'm sure he disabled them prior...

&#x200B;

I've got two questions:

1. Is the smoke created from cooking without ventilation harmful to his health? All the other safety-risks aside.. Does the sheer presence of thick smoke present a health risk?
2. Is there a device that I can place in his room which will measure the air quality/particles/or something else that will alert him to the fact that it's ""too much""?

Thank you all very much!

So it has been a month and now I finally want to do something about the air in my studio apartment that I share with my girlfriend in midtown manhattan. Ours is a old remodelled pre-warish apartment building with a radiator, typical to such buildings, attached to the wall ( as in it cannot be taken out ). The heat setting is common for the entire building and I personally find it to be a tad bit higher than what I'd have preferred. However, that's not the issue. I am concerned about the quality of air coming out of the radiator. My girlfriend and I agree that something is off, specially when we enter the apartment after spending a while outside. Interestingly I have been having headaches + sinus issues + general sense of fatigue and have to regularly open windows to let in some fresh air.

We tried humidifier with essential oils but doesn't look it its helping much.

* No matter the pollution outside, the air in my apartment is always worse.  Indoors you get all the pollution from outside seeping in plus whatever pollution you're creating.  Probably vary's based on the kind of ventilation in your home.  All the same, I'm a little wary of the advice to ""stay indoors"".  
* sources of pollution in my apartment: cooking on the stove, microwave popcorn, using toilet paper, moving any sort of fabric, breathing.
* air can be really dirty without it being visible.  it didn't look smokey today but my sensors (and 3rd party sensors) showed the air was pretty polluted.
* without a well-designed ventilation system, it's really hard to keep air ""healthy"".  If I close the windows and turn on the air purifiers, then I can get rid of the smoke and dust pretty quickly, but then CO2 builds up and I have to open the windows again and let all the pollutants in.
* The three metrics most commonly used to measure air quality: PM2.5 (particulate), CO2, and VOC (volatile organic compounds) levels 
* There is no way to remove CO2 from a residence except through ventilation.   A well designed system would bring in fresh air regularly and filter it as it comes in.

Here are some resources I've found useful.

* Better real time readings
   * [PurpleAir](https://www.purpleair.com/map#12.21/37.7484/-122.45127) \- has a lot more sensors than the government.  
* [Better forecasts](https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/hrrr/HRRRsmoke/Welcome.cgi?dsKey=hrrr_smoke&domain=z1&run_time=23+Aug+2018+-+00Z)  \- click the checkmark next to near-surface smoke under the ""loop"" column
   * [Bay area](https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/hrrr/HRRRsmoke/jsloopLocalDiskDateDomainZipTZA.cgi?dsKeys=hrrr_smoke:&runTime=2018082300&plotName=trc1_z1int&fcstInc=60&numFcsts=60&model=hrrr&ptitle=HRRR%20Model%20Fields%20-%20Experimental&maxFcstLen=66&fcstStrLen=-1&resizePlot=1&domain=z1) 
   * [National](https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/hrrr/HRRRsmoke/jsloopLocalDiskDateDomainZipTZA.cgi?dsKeys=hrrr_smoke:&runTime=2018082300&plotName=trc1_sfc&fcstInc=60&numFcsts=37&model=hrrr&ptitle=HRRR-Smoke%20Model%20Fields%20-%20Experimental&maxFcstLen=36&fcstStrLen=-1&resizePlot=1&domain=full) 
* Air quality sensors.  The scientific ones cost thousands but there are at least two that work alright.
   * Particles (dust, smoke, pollen, etc):  [Dylos Laser Particle Counter](http://www.dylosproducts.com/ornodcairqum.html) 
   * CO2 (people breathing):  [CO2 Meter](https://www.co2meter.com/collections/desktop/products/tim10-desktop-co2-temp-humidity-monitor)
   * VOC (chemicals: paint, varnish):  Haven't found an effective and reasonably priced one yet
* Air purifier that actually works (most are extremely ineffective):
   * [Austin Air Healthmate](http://austinair.com/shop/healthmate/).  Heavy duty machine with a massive filter that handles both particulates and VOCs.  Filter only needs to be changed every 5 years.
