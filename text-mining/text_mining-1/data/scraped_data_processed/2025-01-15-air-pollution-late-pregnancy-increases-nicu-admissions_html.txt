significantly higher risk admitted neonatal intensive care unit ( nicu ) . study , analyzed data 3.6 million single birth u.s. , found exposure nitrogen dioxide ( no2 ) fine particulate matter ( pm2.5 ) increased nicu admission 30-35 % 11-22 % , respectively . finding highlight urgent need address air pollution public health crisis , particularly vulnerable population like pregnant woman newborn . research underscore troubling reality : even area relatively low moderate pollution level , u.s. , traffic-related pollutant near end pregnancy severe consequence newborn . âdespite relatively

condition often necessitate nicu care , emotionally financially taxing family . study also found risk varied region season . example , midwest mid-atlantic region highest nicu admission risk due no2
