Climate change linked with worse HIV prevention and care

Researchers analyzed 22 recent studies exploring HIV-related outcomes in the context of climate change and identified several links between extreme weather events and HIV prevention and care.

New challenges in HIV prevention and care are emerging due to climate change, according to a review published earlier this month in Current Opinions in Infectious Disease.Researchers from the Univers… [+2929 chars]

How climate change may alter hydrology of grassland ecosystems

New research reveals that drought and increased temperatures in a CO2-rich climate can dramatically alter how grasslands use and move water. The study provides the first experimental demonstration of the potential impacts of climate change on water movement t…

How animal poop helps ecosystems adapt to climate change

Relatives of the llama are dropping dung as they venture into higher elevations in the Andes Mountains, providing a nutrient-rich environment for life to thrive despite glacier loss.

Climate change is melting away glaciers around the world, but in the Andes Mountains, a wild relative of the llama is helping local ecosystems adapt to these changes by dropping big piles of dung.Thi… [+4927 chars]

Groundwater in Arctic is delivering more carbon into the ocean than was previously known

A relatively small amount of groundwater trickling through Alaska's tundra is releasing huge quantities of carbon into the ocean, where it can contribute to climate change.

Climate study: Rise in heat deaths will substantially outweigh fewer cold deaths

Climate change will likely result in a significant rise in deaths from heat across Europe, substantially surpassing any decrease in cold-related deaths, according to a new modelling study. This trend persists across climate change scenarios and even under hig…
