Climate change is going to cause massive amounts of human migration. People need to stop looking at these as separate issues.
Of course they do. Immigration is hitting poor communities like a sledgehammer right now. The massive uneven distribution of migrants to already deprived areas further stretching public services is causing mass poverty. Why should the working class care that climate change will ruin their lives if it's already going to hell? Not to mention when they bring up these problems sheltered middleclass types (like half the people in this thread) deny it's a problem and just call them racist. 

If we're the racists then why are our communities taking the lions share of immigrants in?
It's because to most people, "migration problems" are more tangible than climate change problems.

You have faces to blame etc.
Guess what climate change is going to cause.....
That's what happens when the politic class passes a decade surfing on the "immigration problem" trend and denying the antropic climate change cause it "sells better". Every politician is a populist around here and now.
Well good news, climate change drives migrations, so if you fix climate change you won't have as much migration
[removed]
Europe and the gradual slide back to the far right. Yay.
If you don‚Äôt like immigrants then don‚Äôt support policies that make them.
Just tell everyone that more climate change will result in more migration and the right wingers will become the greenest of the green.
The two go hand in hand, climate change is driving migration.
People who fear Immigration should really fear climate change
They should be.Imagine being a minority in your own country just so rich old dudes could suppress wages
Working on climate change would make it more likely that people would stop fleeing countries that are going to sink or bake.
Yep. Migration we can do something about. Climate change is going to happen.
Can this sub please get a report option for racism or bigotry and misinformation already? I'm fucking tired of all the racist bullshit I'm having to debunk. Please do not let this sub get turned into r/worldnews or r/europe.
A day late and an Euro short.
If you see how media portrays both cases and how politician weaponize it it's obvious why so many people are afraid of it. 

*A national commits a crime* 
News be like: Horrible crime happend at that place. 

*An Immigrant commits a crime*
News be like: country of origin person commited a crime at that place.  (The article will not focus on the crime, but the fact they are not a national).
EU doesn‚Äôt deal with illegal immigration enough. Being politically correct doesn‚Äôt work.
Surprise, they‚Äôre a package deal!
[removed]
Maybe the effort and policy will be shifted to stabilize Middle East and North Africa. And send them back to there
No doubt this is true. But this is reverse colonization and blowback from 500 years of European expansion. Congratulations.
This is textbook irony. Escape from tyranny to find the promised land; occupy a continent, mass murder and subdue an entire indigenous population; transport slaves from another country; build an entire economic model based on exploitation. Then fear migration.
Many countries systems for assimilation aren‚Äôt really up to the task. Migrants need language training and job skills, as well as learning about the legal landscape that likely varies from their home country. Current citizens may fear the ‚Äúothers‚Äù. 

May I suggest more one on one family mentoring and, oh, potlucks. Srsly. Meet and greet and see each other as people. Probably more solutions, too, but better integration is the key.
They're related, idiots. Maybe worry about *both*.
In other news: Europeans are dumb as fuck. More at 8.
Hmm‚Ä¶ I wonder what the middle-term consequences of Climate Change will be hmmm it's a mystery‚Ä¶
It's the same thing, migration is partly climate change driven.
The former is fueled by the latter lmao
As they should. Most people saying this is xenophobic/racists don‚Äôt live in a place that has to deal with mass migration.¬†
Support immigration. Do NOT support illegal immigration. Meaning do not support people forcing their way in.
Wait til they hear about climate migration üòÇüòÇüòÇ
When I was homeless climate change acctually sounded like a good thing as it would be warmer. Our welfare system LITERALLY several ppl told me that ifI wasnt just poor and disabled but also someone who just arrived I would get help. Otherwise its back to the streets. In a country where a home isnt seen as a right, so therefor they never really bothered housing our homeless for years but then when we took in refugees suddenly three times the amount of housing could be built.. Honestly surprised not more ppl are violently racist when the welfare system is so frank about help and support for them but not for our own citizens..¬†
Yeah I don't blame them at all. Climate change is an esoteric and poorly defined problem while mass influx of incompatible cultures demanding the host country assimilate to them rather than vice versa is a very immediate and in your face problem.
Climate migration is gonna hit a lot of people like a sack of bricks.
unchecked illegal immigration kills you much faster then climate change.
I dont agree but I understand. I'm not being rob on the street by melting ice, it's always arabs (at least in my city and in my experience) 4 times has someone tried to rob me 100% of the time they were arabs. I know quite a few people with the same experience.
Golly gee I wonder why. Could the murder and rape of innocent Europeans have anything to do with it?
Wait till they find out what happens when climate change forces people out of their homes
Oof than I‚Äôd hate to tell them what‚Äôs caused mass migration since the dawn of time
Euroids spending the last few centuries up to the present destroying many of these countries and now getting mad the people who live in those countries that got destroyed want to go somewhere else.

It's going to be even more fun for everyone once things get worse with the climate and has even more people trying to relocate to other areas while western powers keep on doing nothing to meaningfully tackle the climate issue.
It's destroying their countries no shit
Does anyone know the method that they used to gather this information? It only says interview, is there anything more specific?
Until our political and popular elites practice what they preach on climate change, I don‚Äôt give a shit about it either.
Climate change / global warming will be directly proportional to migration so this is redundant information.
That's what happens when politicians politicise social issues, protecting the interests of corporations while distracting their voters. Thank you for having people worry about gay people having rights or migrants having phones etc (which is just so obvious it should be a non question, these people deserve at least equal treatment to others, positive discrimination might even be considered), instead of worrying about capitalism ruining our planets and our individual lives
Not Greta.
It's not like those two things are disconnected.  
Every one degree more in global average temperature results in roughly one billion more global refugees. ([link](https://earth.org/for-every-1c-rise-in-temperature-a-billion-people-will-endure-insufferable-heat/))  
Mass migration is just another consequence of climate change.
I drove from Phoenix to the Grand Canyon once and on a winding downhill cliff edge road watched a guy gets so caught up on avoiding a small pothole that he almost ran himself off the side. People fixate on the immediate problems, future existential threats are just hard to wrap your head around.
I actually think migration is good, but please, no more Muslims. Islam is just an objectively bad religion that doesn't belong in civilized society. People that migrate to Europe should make a commitment that they will not follow Islam too seriously
I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a lot more press coverage of mass migration than there is danger from climate change.

We allow world leaders and corporate tycoons to fuck up the world with short sighted profit seeking policies and surprise Pikachu face when that shit comes back to bite.

But sure let‚Äôs blame the people fleeing from war and poverty when the inequality enforced by the wealthy gets worse.
Concerns about both are reasonable.
I don't understand, if people hate immigrants this much then how come they have no control over stopping immigration? I guess they aren't true democracies lol.
And rightfully so
Europe. As stupid as the next continent...
As they should
Well they better get used to it if climate change isn't addressed
Oil backed media:


So it's working then
Jokes on us, climate change is bound to cause more migration.
Ligtle do they know that climate change will make large patches of Earth inhabita√¶ and thus cause massive migration to Europe
Well one is gonna cause the other so...
Climate change is a big issue, but you also can't really see it. We don't know how bad it will get, and scientists are only able to give estimates on how bad it will be in the future. 

You can clearly see the crime rates and other problems that are being caused by mass immigration over a short period of time.

Can see why a decent number of people are more worried about immigration than climate change. I don't agree with it completely and climate change is something that will make it worse in the future, but I can see why they feel that way.
One is going to make the other oh so much worse. Mass migration caused by climate change is going to be here in a handful of years.
My hot take that the fear of immigration while also about increasing crime rates and lack of assimilation has more to do with the fact that globally the world is overpopulated if hold the assumption that most people want a western middle class ish lifestyle. So I think this is really about resources
People seem to not realize that immigration is the literal start to any empire / country / civilizations demise since the dawn of time. People on the outside want what's on the inside.
This "study" is produced by a right wing think tank.. follow the money
The European theatre is gonna go crazy during the Water Wars
well yeah, climate kills us in 50 years, mass immigration can start a war tomorrow.
I hate humanity
Well good news! Climate change is also going to amatically increase climate migrants in emergency situations!
Immigration itself is not bad. It's Europe's approach to it that was terrible. Europeans arrogantly believed their social structure could overcome the culture of anyone they accepted.

If instead the EU has just made it easier for skilled labor and educated professionals to immigrate and naturalize, they would have easily achieved the same population growth goals with east asian immigrants alone, from countries with an excess of college grads but not enough jobs. No religious baggage, highly educated baseline, willingness to assimilate. 

But of course that would put pressure on the already piss poor wages of European professionals.
"Europeans prefer the planet burn than live next to a brown person."
Ignorant question.

Why is it so easy to migrate in certain European countries?
I mean climate change and mass migration are not completely exclusive of each other
Funny one leads to the other. Just shows racists are as dense as they seam.
Probably because one actually affects their life negatively, and the other is government and their media partners fear mongering.


Remember an inconvenient truth? The coasts should all be under water by now.


It's funny how climate change is always solved by taxing the people more, making the people pay more for energy, forcing people to change how they live because DOOM IS COMING.¬†


But amazon using 100ft of plastic wrap tape and 2 boxes to ship a USB drive is fine. The Temus of the world shipping cheap plastic crap around the world on container ships just for it to break in a week and get tossed fine.And of course flying private jets and cruising th globe in Yachts totally fine.
Which is why our species is going to die off and take many others with it.
They are directly linked.
It‚Äôs so funny when you compare the talking points used by New York elites in the 19th century with the ones used by far right parties today and realise that basically nothing has changed since than
Queue spider man pointing at spider man meme
US democrats are leaving themselves wide open on this issue and it's going to cost them big time
I'm sure there are many Canadians who are feeling exactly the same right now.
2nd most common name for babies in the uk is Mohammed, and that's just one variation.
And we know which migrants they fear.
We don't fear migration we fear islamic migration. Not compatiable with our culture ( which we fought and bled a lot for).
well, shit happens...
They‚Äôre intertwined are they not? They will be more so in the not too distant future. Pressure on water sources, land etc will only lead to more migration. Many European countries will be relatively ok with climate change compared to large swathes of the world, the U.K. being one of them. Fix the planet before this happens
Climate change will cause migration
Most people are unable (or worse, unwilling) to put themselves in someone else's shoes.

History would look very different had that not been the case.
Rightly so.
They should have thought about it before conquering the ‚Äúnew worlds‚Äù.
They need to understand that climate change is one of the factors of migration.
Um yeah there is not enough infrastructure to support this boost of people.  Most of the parents i know cant get their kids into kintergarten because they are all full.  Migrants get priority over the other childeren.  And i kinda of get that.  Their kids need more help getting socialized to the country.  the doctors' offices are at capacity.  No doctors are taking any new patients.  Any appointment for my wife, myself or children are 1 hour late at a minimum every time.  We get there when we are supposed too but then have to wait an hour past our appointment time just to get in.  The pharmacy is constantly out of medicine. It's kinda funny because we have to call all the pharmacies just to see if we can get meds. If you need any social services, good luck.  Most have a 6month to 1 year waiting list.  This is in my town and we live in a rural germany. Almost a small city but bigger than a village.  We have our own hospital.  But a few months ago, my wife needed surgery and had to stay overnight, but we had to wait 6 hours for a bed.  She got to go ahead of some people because they wanted to do surgery that night.  the emergency room waiting room was turned into a waiting room for hospital beds.  This was in the middle of the week at like  10 in the morning. And there were 10-15 people waiting for beds.  They were trying to send people to the next closest  hospital, but they were also full.
Europe deserves the migration, shouldn't have removed the plug that kept the migrants away. Probably don't help destabilize countries in north Africa, Middle-east next time.
Its the same problem. climate change will make things worse in africa and the middle east and more will flee north.
Yikes üò≥
Lol. You're not ready to see migration because of climate change. It won't happen now but it is bound to happen.
Why did these democracies choose to keep the global south poor if they didn‚Äôt want citizens of those countries to migrate to countries with more opportunity?
