Republicans consistently introduce and pass laws to repeal environmental regulations and make it easier for industries to destroy the planet faster. So yes.

Climate science is literally the exact opposite of primitive superstition wtf
In the coming years you can expect climate deniers to increasingly shift to 'climate fatalism' as the signs of climate change become impossible to ignore or explain away as "it's just weather."

Instead of "but it snowed last winter" it'll be "sure we haven't had snow in ten years but that's not our fault, *it just happened*."
No, Pumpkin, not listening to scientific data and saying ThE TeMpEratuRe HaS ALWaYs cHANgED and it's SNowING So It can'T Be HOTTeR is the real primitive superstition, you groomer.
He believes in a magic sky genie and thinks Dems are superstitious?
Okay guys, time to add “15th-century Aztec priests” to the list of people who are smarter than Matt Walsh
The Aztec empire is a bad concept to invoke when you're asserting your civilization couldn't possibly be mere decades away from destruction via a growing existential threat you are oblivious to.
This should never have been a political issue, but unfortunately it has been for decades. The GOP just happens to have been on the wrong side of the argument since day one. Also there is no longer a distinction between MAGA and the GOP, especially on this issue.
I would trust more an Aztec priest than a republican lol
Love the rascism in his insult. Aztecs had accurate calendars, built sophisticated civilization etc but please tell us how the “brown people are savages” Matt.
[I will just leave this here,](https://scitechdaily.com/aztec-science-precise-solar-observations-fed-millions-in-ancient-mexico/#:~:text=Aztec%20farming%20calendar%20accurately%20tracked,even%20adjusted%20for%20leap%20years.) because it's really funny.
GOP: Don't blame us! We didn't do anything.

The rest of America:

I point this out every time I see a post about how horrible school lunch is. Blame republicans. Every one of them. We have had Democrat after democrat try to pass more money for public schools including a First Lady who made fixing school lunch her main platform for 8 years. 

The GOP has blocked every single effort at every single turn. 

It is directly their fault.
Denying that shitting where you eat makes people sick is a very MAGA thing to do - because the Democrats make them!!!
Ah yes, Science, that irrelevant cult.
1450 aztec priests

When was the bible written? Exactly
daily reminder the daily wire, ben shapiro, and matt walsh only exist because of the wilks brothers, literal oil billionaires who fund conservative propaganda and obviously oppose anything that threatens the oil and gas industry, which means climate denialism is a healthy heaping of any content they have their hands in.

also wanna point out, oil and gas is a 4.6 TRILLION dollar a year industry. thats PROFIT\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

keep that in mind the next time you hear someone talk about how climate change is made up.

On the plus side, maybe some of this garbage will disappear once Russia has been demilitarized and their regime terminated.
Weren’t the Aztecs doing brain surgery with a really high success rate?
The projection continues.

The people most driven by "primitive superstition" accuse their opponents of it.  Like clockwork.

People should obviously be leaving Twitter entirely, but at the very least ignore Matt Walsh.  Stop feeding the trolls.
Remember when James Inhofe walked into the Senate with a snowball "proving" climate change isn't real? Which party is he with again? And who are his biggest donors? Hint: it's the party you think it is and the donors are exactly who you'd think they'd be.
I'm more concerned re Matt's obsession with the sex lives of children.
*"Now they're blaming us, the* ***'dragons deserve more rights than people'*** *party for the dragons burning the town down!! Stop with all this primitive superstition!"* 

&#x200B;

>!Dragons = Corporations !<
So conservatives like Matt Walsh don't take the advice of doctors/scientists when it comes to vaccines, climate change, abortion, etc. and believe in a 2000 year old religion with no verifiable proof that their God even exists - and yet liberals are the ones mired in superstition? It's not even worth debating these people anymore. They have completely disassociated with reality and are a danger to civilization at this point.
Yeah who believes in the greenhouse effect? Like Democrats keep saying that greenhouse gases exist but you can't even see them.
Facts have a Liberal bias.
Republicans are fucking braindead. What's worse is they're actual parasites on the resources that could be used on people with a functioning brain
I’ll show him my climate science studies if he will show me his. Bet my climate science is bigger than his
Daily reminder that Shat Walsh and the Daily Liar are funded by fracking billionaires
They are now directly blaming the guy with a bloody knife for all the stab wounds
This is rich coming from the same guy and crowd that refused to wear masks (unless attempting terrorism) during and after a global pandemic. I know he’s just using this type of language as ragebait, but goddamn is Matt Walsh a waste of oxygen.
Oh, you think that the release of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels causes global warming and that the politicians who have repeated blocked attempts to curtail those emissions are culpable for their actions? Are you superstitious?
Yes, we in the states, and the world, should blame republicans for slow walking, stopping, and downright lying about this issue. Republicans should forever be known as an enemy of the human race, and who still to this day commit crimes against humanity.
Think of it this way.  If a party votes to block a fire station from being built in your neighborhood, and your house starts burning and eventually burns down, you should blame that party, right?

It is their inaction and obstruction that is contributing.
Gee, Matt, its almost like Donald Trump deliberately ripped up all the Environmental legislation he could, while his GOP cronies do all they can to deny the effects of carbon emissions on the climate 

It's almost as though policies of inaction have consequences, weird that
I love how with Matt Walsh (and co)  logic , blaming hot weather on poor climate change action is wild , but wildfire smoke from Canada in NYC is a liberal false flag conspiracy 😭 it would be funny if it wasn’t sad.
Matt Walsh also believe FDR is one of the worst presidents of all time. So like he's pretty dumb.
An evangelical said “primitive superstition” lol.
Matt Walsh is a chinless pedophile
Matt Walsh sounds unhinged. Very nasty. Sad.
Turns out the Aztec Calander is more accurate than the Roman calender and they didn't name all the months after brutish dictators like simps.
It turns out that the Aztec calculation of an average 365.2420 days per year is actually closer to the real value of 365.2422 days than the old Julian value of 365.2500 days or even our current Gregorian value of 365.2425 days.

 The Sun Stone was hand-carved in the 52-year period from 1427 to 1479.
This is their MO. Break it and then blame someone else as to why it doesn't work. Just ask the Postal service.
I fucking hate Republicans
no individual persons are responsible for climate change. every consuming human could make major changes and not make a dent.

corporations are the issue. they produce nearly all the products and services that are directly responsible for climate change. unless corporations are forced to change, our world will continue to burn.
When I was studying abroad for a semester at the Universidad de las Americas Puebla located near Cholula, Puebla, Mexico I took a cultural anthropology course. The professor told us one day that he had heard from locals in Puebla that they stole the rain from the neighboring state of Tlaxcala. He made some initial questions, got nowhere, and let the topic rest. A few years later while he was in Tlaxcala, he heard people complaining that Puebla was stealing their rain. That perked his ears up so he investigated the topic again. Eventually, he met a curandero who explained to him that in the spring he and some others would go to the mountain chain that separates Puebla and Tlaxcala and burn all the vegetation that was growing. This created a blackened surface which absorbed the sun's heat and released it at night displacing the cooler, wetter mountain air towards Puebla. This professor asked to be taken to the mountains and while walking around noticed broken pottery. Even though he was a cultural anthropologist, he recognized that the multitude of artifacts on the slopes were pre-Columbian and that people had been "stealing" rain for centuries.

So, yeah, I would say the Aztecs and other Central Mexican groups are smarter than Walsh.

Shoutout to Timothy Knab, the cultural anthropology professor at UDLAP. He's got some really entertaining books like *A War of Witches* and *Mad Jesus*
I definitely blame Matt and his oil baron funders for the temperature outside.  Eat a bag of dicks, Matt.
Remember, Hillary Clinton is about 8 billion times smarter than Matt Walsh is.
Projecting
see also: blaming arsonists for forest fires.
I know next to nothing about the Aztec, but considering that priests in most ancient cultures doubled as philosophers and the first scientists, then yes, an Aztec priest from 1450 has more scientific credibility than Matt Walsh
So can republicans explain how they are not responsible when there is mountains of evidence that carbon emissions cause warming climate and the republicans bloc environmentalist laws . These idiots are to blame that’s how this works.
Matt Walsh has the scientific credibility of Mike Lindell when he was addicted to crack.
"Sinners cause hurricanes" is totally reasonable though.
This guy is kinda insufferable
Republicans sure do lack reading comprehension. I'd be surprised if more than 1% of them understood sentences with words more than one syllable.
Maga Republicans: Democrats are the party of primitive superstition

Also Maga Republicans: Trump is the 2nd coming of Jesus Christ and he is going to bring about Judgment Day in which we the true believers will ascend to Heaven and everyone else will burn in eternal hellfire
The party that still lets a book of fairy tales dictate modern policy wants to call science superstition, good one Matt maybe lay off the horse tranq
Matt Walsh talking about scientific credibility is like watching an orangutan yell at a wall. This motherfucker probably couldn’t even tell me what elements carbon dioxide is made of, let alone explain why it’s a greenhouse gas.
I'd still trust a Aztec priest before Walsh. At least the priest have an excuse to be ignorant
I feel like conservatives have all been taken in by some hippie dippie "manifest your reality" scam.  They seem utterly convinced that a lie, repeated enough, eventually becomes the truth.
why is he attacking "scientific credibility" when the marks he's lying to all think science is a conspiracy to kick god out of schools or w/e
Something something Paris Agreement
The percentage of maga republicans that add any value whatsoever to society is closer to 0% than it is to 1%
Wait, a republican is making fun of Primitive superstitions?! 👀
Funny how the guy who literally believes an invisible man lives in the sky, and believes that you must kiss the invisible man’s ass or be tortured in a lake of fire for eternity, is complaining about “primitive superstition”
The most popular movie with republicans is Sound of Freedom, a movie roughly about child trafficking. The movie is based on Tim Ballard who believes that children are kidnapped and harvested for adrenochrome which Hollywood and democrats use in satanic rituals to stay young and Donald Trump was sent by God to stop the harvesting. But please Matt, tell me more about how the left has fallen to superstition.
“Primitive superstition”

I love reading right wing views because I get to see their tactics of manipulation; and if you’re dumb enough to deny climate change then you’ll certainly fall for coercive terminology like “primitive superstition.”

Let’s remove the argument of climate change being real. Right now, if energy sources such as coal and oil are to be relied on then everyone can agree they are non-renewable. And when a finite and valuable resource diminishes in supply it becomes increasingly unaffordable.

So for that reason alone we need to technologically advance from a bad thing to a better thing.

I recently saw a climate change denier post on Facebook a video of a billionaire saying it’s all bullshit because coastal properties are very expensive and are often mortgaged and no bank would lend on a risky property because that property is the asset on which their loan is secured.

And if you listen only to his argument, it seems like a strong argument. Except… it’s a requirement of a mortgage to insure the property and building insurance companies factor in flooding risks which increases the premiums of such policies. It also guarantees the aforementioned asset on which the loan is secured is also secured by insurance. The banks don’t care if the $7m house falls into the sea, it’s not only covered by an insurance policy, it’s covered by an insurance policy they didn’t even have to pay for.
Rich coming from a dipshit theocratic fascist.  How that dickbutt ever got famous is beyond me.
And oil companies have known they are responsible for decades and they have actively lobbied to prevent from getting fined or regulated. The party that has been the most receptive to their lobbying? Republicans.
"They believe in primitive superstition" says supporter of party who thinks:

Democrats drink baby blood from abortion clinics to stay young.

That Jesus wants Trump to be president. 

That gay people can make you gay by existing. 

That Covid 19 is a secret code by a shadow organization.

Also, the Covid was to punish us for having "too many gay people and trans people"

That books need to be banned and burned. 


Yes yes, it is the left who is buried in superstition.  Clearly.
Talk of “scientific credibility” from the people who said “vaccines are mind control, masks don’t work, give me the horse dewormer.” It would be fucking hilarious if it wasn’t making the world so much worse so quickly.
I blame the Republicunt Party for a lot more than the temperature outside, Mattie.
In 2017, Trump pulled the US out of the Paris climate agreement calling climate change a “hoax”.  He then said American wealth is based on energy and he would not jeopardize that for dreams and windmills.  

On the flip side, Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act is a win, win for fighting climate change.  

Every Democrat voted YES. 

Every Republican voted NO to saving Mother Earth.  

Climate change is real.  People can say they don't believe in gravity, but if they step off a cliff, they’re going down. 

At this point, even if someone doesn’t believe humans contribute to climate change, maybe just acknowledge it is happening and we need to address it.
Bad example if you think about, an Aztec priest in 1450 warning of destruction and death would be correct
Wasn’t it trump who pulled out of the climate change group that Obama worked so hard to put together for all the other countries to work together with?? Wasn’t it trump who approved the pipeline that ended leaking millions of gallons of oil into the water??? Hmmm
I find it humorous that Democrats are focused on issues like the environment, healthcare, education etc. then the republicans be like “but the Barbie movie…” “what’s on the laptop?!” As an Irishman living in Canada, that’s beyond baffling to me 🤷🏻‍♂️
Anytime there's criminal activity in a city conservatives blame the democrats.
Reading the controversial comments, I found a couple sad themes:

-A lot of really stupid people don't know that Republicans have been actively helping large companies pollute for decades by turning back environmental regulations. Thats what they mean by being "pro-business" because it's cheaper to dump toxic chemicals in a river than dispose of them properly. 

-A lot of really lonely guys are super triggered by Hillary, and it's embarrassing as fuck. She's a boogeyman who's apparently committed all these crimes and murders, I guess, but you can't see any evidence because of 'the deep state' or something?

All they know is projection and bigotry
Matt Walsh is such a gormless fonzanoon.
His poor kids.
Says the people who believe a vaccine is the work of Satan.
Can someone just yeet Matt Walsh into the sun please?
I'm not the greatest at history but was there even Aztecs in 1450? I don't exactly know when the Spanish killed them all
I agree,vote the MAGAs out!
I just hate that they’re called “maga republicans” they’re just basic republicans and they’ve been this vile and stupid for a long ass time, like way before Trump.
The funny thing is, the Aztecs were actually fucking brilliant for their time😆
If you ignore the problem you are the problem
Primitive superstition..... like religion?
“Primitive superstition” is rich coming from the party of Christianity
It’s hilarious that any conservatives would claim someone else has fallen into a state of primitive superstition. Unbelievable. 🤦‍♂️
"The democrats are coming for your gas-stoves and guzzler SUVs!" --Conservatives everywhere

Yeah, they do sound so very sane.
Hey, why not? The QAnon person in my life believes our government and/or military can control the weather and is making it hot on purpose.
Isn’t primitive superstition the basis for most of the republican platform?
Lol ‘superstitious’ this dog-shit-for-brains fascist has a video insisting the evidence for his homie jEbUs coming back from the dead like a zombie is ‘overwhelming’.
Doesn't matt walsh think some dude who died 2000 years ago is coming back to life or some bullshit like that?
A 1450 Aztec priest is more humane, and scientifically literate, than MAGA.
 
 These guys just... they're trash.
 
If given a choice between them and a slider that just bit me, I'd pick the fucking spider.
