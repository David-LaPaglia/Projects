Vegetable vendor Shivnarayan Dasana had never seen so many policemen descend on his village in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh.
The 60-year-old lives in Tarapur in the industrial town of Pithampur, known for its automobile and pharmaceutical factories. The town has been tense since containers holding 337 tonnes of toxic waste from the site of one of the world's worst industrial disasters arrived for disposal three weeks ago.
The waste, transported from the now-defunct Union Carbide factory in the city of Bhopal - site of the 1984 gas tragedy that killed thousands - has sparked fears among locals.
They worry that disposing of it near their homes could be harmful and even cause an environmental disaster.
Protests erupted on 3 January, a day after the waste arrived in the town, escalating into stone-throwing and attempted self-immolations.
Since then, heavy police patrols near the disposal facility have turned Tarapur and surrounding areas into a virtual garrison.
The police have registered seven cases against 100 people since the protests began, but the townspeople continue to raise concerns about industrial pollution at smaller community meetings.
The toxic waste cleared from the Bhopal factory included five types of hazardous materials - including pesticide residue and "forever chemicals" left from its manufacturing process. These chemicals are so-named because they retain their toxic properties indefinitely. 
Over the decades, these chemicals have seeped into the surrounding environment, creating a health hazard for people living around the factory in Bhopal.
But officials dismiss fears of the waste disposal causing environmental issues in Pithampur.
Senior official Swatantra Kumar Singh outlined the staggered process in an attempt to reassure the public.
"Hazardous waste will be incinerated at 1,200C (2,192F), with 90kg (194.4lb) test batches followed by 270kg batches over three months if toxicity levels are safe," he said.
Mr Singh explained that a "four-layer filtering will purify smoke", which will prevent toxins from entering the air and the residue from incineration will be "sealed in a two layer membrane" and "buried in a specialised landfill" to prevent soil and groundwater contamination.
"We've trained 100 'master trainers' and are hosting sessions to explain the disposal process and build public trust," said administrator Priyank Mishra.
Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav has also defended the waste disposal, calling it both safe and necessary. He urged residents to voice their concerns legally, noting that the disposal was carried out only after orders from the high court.
Environmental experts, however, have differing views on the process. 
Some like Subhash C Pandey believe the disposal poses no risk if done properly. Others, like Shyamala Mani, are calling for alternatives to incineration. She argues that incineration increases residual slag and releases harmful toxins like mercury and dioxins. 
Ms Mani suggests that bioremediation, a process using micro-organisms to break down harmful substances in waste, could be a more effective and eco-friendly solution.
But residents remain sceptical.  
"It's not just waste. It's poison," said Gayatri Tiwari, a mother of five in Tarapur village. "What's the point of life if we can't breathe clean air or drink clean water?"
Pollution is an undeniable reality for the residents of Pithampur. Residents cite past groundwater contamination and ongoing health issues as reasons for scepticism.
The town's rapid industrial growth in the 1980s led to hazardous waste build-up, contaminated water and soil with mercury, arsenic and sulphates. By 2017, the federal agency Central Pollution Control Bureau flagged severe pollution in the area.
Locals allege that many companies don't follow the rules to dispose of non-hazardous waste, choosing to dump it in the soil or water. Tests in 2024 showed elevated harmful substances in water. Activists link this to alleged environmental violations at the disposal facility but officials have denied this.
"Water filters in our homes don't last two months. Skin diseases and kidney stones are common now. Pollution has made life unbearable," said Pankaj Patel, 32, from Chirakhan village, pointing to his water purifier which needs frequently replacing.
Srinivas Dwivedi, regional officer of the State Pollution Control Board, dismissed concerns, saying it's "unrealistic" to expect pre-industrial conditions in Pithampur.
Meanwhile, in Bhopal, nearly 230km (143 miles) away from Pithampur, activists argue that the disposal process is a distraction from much larger issues. 
Since the disaster, the toxic material lay in the mothballed factory for decades, polluting groundwater in the surrounding areas.
More than 1.1 million tonnes of contaminated soil remain at the Union Carbide factory site, according to a 2010 report by National Environmental Engineering Research Institute and the National Geophysical Research Institute.
"The government is making a show of disposing of 337 metric tonnes while ignoring the much bigger problem in Bhopal," said Nityanand Jayaraman, a leading environmentalist. 
"The contamination has worsened over the years, yet the government has done little to address it," added Rachna Dhingra, another activist.
Government estimates say 3,500 people died shortly after the gas leak, with over 15,000 dying later. Activists claim the toll is much higher, with victims still suffering from the side effects of the poisoning.
"Given Pithampur's history of pollution, residents' fears are valid," said Mr Jayaraman.
Officials said they are only "dealing with the waste as specified by the court's directive". 
But the reality of Bhopal has deepened the mistrust among the people of Pithampur, who are now prepared to take to the streets again to oppose the waste disposal. 
Vegetable vendor Shivnarayan Dasana said the issue goes beyond the waste itself.
"It's about survival - ours and our children's," he said.
