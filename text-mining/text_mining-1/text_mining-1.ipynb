       "  'subreddit': 'Bangkok',\n",
       "  'text': 'Every week we see plenty of posts about how bad Bangkoks air quality is. The air quality is certainly not good. Consensus seems to be that this is devastating to your health and if you live in Bangkok for decades you\\'ll reduce your life span by 5-10 years. Comments in these posts offering a different viewpoint always gets downvoted so there\\'s never any constructive discussion about this topic. I wanted to look into this some more and get some other perspectives on this. \\n\\nAs a starting point, the average lifespan for Bangkok residents is 78.97 years. Very close to top modern countries with very little air pollution. Why do they live so long if air pollution significantly reduced their life span? \\n\\nI also ran this query on ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini: \\n\"If I live in Bangkok for 50 years. By how much am I reducing my life expectancy due to air pollution? \"\\nThey all gave answers between 1-4 years based on various studies and research. Please run the query by yourself for details. Their answers seemed very credible with good sources. 1-4 years shorter life span is probably a lot less than most people would have thought. \\n\\nThen we also need to consider that most expats won\\'t spend more than perhaps 2-3 hours a day breathing in the polluted air. You can also have air purifiers at home and at your office so that you breathe in close to perfect air most of the day. You can also mitigate much damage by maintaining strong health in general and you can wear a PM2.5 face mask while riding your motorbike in heavy traffic. \\n\\nIf you use the AI models to run a query with these factors as well, their response is that you\\'ll reduce your lifespan by 6-12 months. But we could make a long list of things that most people do or don’t do that reduces your lifespan by an equal amount or more due to non optimal, sleep, exercise and diet. But people prefer to complain about air pollution while their poor general health is what’s going to take many more years of their life than what air pollution in Bangkok ever will. \\n\\nThe other part of this topic would be the immediate health concerns which is more subjective and personal. What I can say is that myself and the vast majority of people I speak to do not have immediate symptoms besides days where AQI goes above  150+, which is a small minority of all days of the year. Keep in mind that the average PM 2.5 in Bangkok is 25-30 which is categorized as “moderate” and not “unhealthy” according to the AQI index. People seem to believe that Bangkok has the worst air quality in the world on par with New Delhi etc. Which is simply not true. Again, Bangkoks air quality is labeled as “moderate” based on the AQI index. \\n\\nI\\'m not saying Bangkoks air quality is good and I\\'m not saying that there\\'s no health implications. And of course it should be a top priority for the city to greatly reduce air pollution. What I am saying is that the health implications are a lot less severe than people think and that most people (not all) can do things to mitigate them to such a large extent that the impact on your immediate health is not noticeable and that your lifespan will most likely not be significantly reduced. \\n\\nEdit 1\\nPlease understand that this post looks at air pollution from the perspective of the average expat here in Bangkok. Which is what this subreddit mostly consist of. Of course the situation is different for other groups of people such as local delivery drivers. \\n\\nEdit 2\\nThere’s several top comments here being upvoted saying that the AI models can’t be trusted. The AI models did not come up with the life expectancy being reduced by 1-4 years. They merely quote studies and use tools developed for this purpose. For example, ChatGPT used “The Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) which is “a tool that measures the impact of air pollution on life expectancy”. It was created exactly for this purpose and it’s used by the WHO, UN and many governments like the UK. Its conclusion based on Bangkoks pm2.5 levels was a reduced life expectancy of 1.75 years. All in line with other studies that the AI models quoted. Also in line with Bangkoks life expectancy already being high at 79 and clearly not significantly lower than other countries. \\n\\nSo no, the AI models didn’t make up this data. Run the query yourself and you’ll see the exact sources and models they used to conclude the 1-4 years of reduced life expectancy (without the mitigations of reduced exposure to outside air, air purifiers etc).

      "Air quality in Los Angeles has improved as the Palisades and Eaton wildfires get under control. But as the fires burned through houses, cars and industrial areas, they spewed out vast amounts of smoke, ash and noxious gases that spread across the city. Indicators like the Air Quality Index (AQI), commonly used to track air pollution levels, provide a rough sense of the pollution floating in the skies. But those types of indicators don't capture some of the other potentially health-damaging materials in the air that get released during fires. And many Angelenos have been wondering how to assess the risks to their health. \n",

      "NPR spoke with health and wildfire smoke experts to answer some basic questions. What does the AQI tell us and how is it measured? The AQI incorporates measurements of five different air pollutants that the Environmental Protection Agency regulates: fine particles, ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. Decades of health science have demonstrated that such pollutants damage the health of those who breathe them in regularly. The AQI was designed to represent health risks from common pollutants, such as car exhaust or smog. The EPA collects data for the AQI from some 4,000 air quality monitoring stations dotted around the country. But air quality can vary on a hyperlocal scale, meaning the network of official sites is \"fairly sparse,\" says Michael Jerrett, an air pollution expert at the University of California, Los Angeles. \"They don't have the spatial density or indeed sometimes the temporal density to tell us what's really happening on the kind of localized level that really matters to people,\" he says. The EPA created six color-coded categories from green (good, when the AQI is under 50) to maroon (hazardous, when the metric exceeds 301, as it often does near actively burning wildfires). Though Jerrett says, '\"good\" is a bit of a misnomer because even low levels of exposure to air pollution are associated with health problems. \n",

      "What doesn't AQI tell us?

Homes, for example, are jam-packed with synthetic materials—think of couches and mattresses—along with appliances, coolant fluids, metal wiring, asbestos tiling, lead paint, and many other materials that can generate dangerous pollutants. \n",

      "\"They emit more toxic material per unit burnt than vegetation,\" says Colleen Reid, a health geographer who has studied wildfire smoke at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Researchers led experiments that simulated burning homes, and they measured carcinogens such as benzene or formaldehyde that developed in the smoke along with a long list of other harmful materials. They then exposed mice to the smoke. \"It is more toxic to these animals who are breathing it in than urban air pollution or than wildfire smoke derived from biomass fuel alone,\" says Luke Montrose, a wildfire smoke expert and an environmental toxicologist at Colorado State University. Most of those potentially harmful gases and particles are not monitored in most of the U.S. If AQI is \"good,\" should I still be worried? Smoke conditions in the LA-region have improved as the fires get further contained and wind patterns redirect smoke away from the Los Angeles Basin. AQI readings have reported \"good\" conditions for many recent days. But the remnants of the smoke and ash that blanketed the city are still settling, and those present ongoing risks, Jerrett says. He recommends using the AQI as an indicator of how much pollution might be in the air. New smoke could appear quickly if wind patterns change, and the potentially toxic ash that spread across the city in the fires' early days can get fluffed back into the air by wind, too. \n",

      "Because the EPA sensors are spaced far apart, several experts suggest keeping track of more localized data, such as the PurpleAir network, which measures fine particles in the air. The data comes from small sensors people can buy and place near their homes; there are thousands across the Los Angeles region. The accuracy is lower than the regulatory monitors, but updates every two minutes, while the regulatory monitors report an average over many hours or a full day. Or, suggests Montrose, you can even buy personal air quality monitors, small enough to clip onto a backpack. \"Knowledge is power,\" he says. Personal air monitors won't tell you what toxic contaminants are in the air. But the measurements can give you a general sense of the risk. How can I protect myself and my family from potentially dangerous air? Even when wildfire smoke comes primarily from trees or plants rather than manmade materials, it incurs heavy health outcomes. Recent analyses suggest it's a factor in some 16,000 uncounted deaths each year in the U.S. Smoke exposure is rarely marked down as the primary cause of death, but the extra stress on people's bodies can impact their existing health challenges so drastically, in some cases, that it leads to premature death. Wildfire smoke exposure has also been tied to higher risks of cardiovascular problems, mental health issues, skin troubles and the worsening of respiratory illnesses. Toxicologists have a common saying: The dose makes the poison. So the primary goal, says Lisa Patel, a pediatrics expert at Stanford University and part of the group Science Moms, is to lower your dose. \"Trust your nose,\" Patel says. \"So if you're smelling that pollution, go ahead and put that mask on.\" The ash from the fires' early days could get stirred up again by wind or moving air. So Patel says if concerned, parents could err on the side of caution and consider limiting kids' outdoor activity time. \n",

But as the fires burned through houses, cars and industrial areas, they spewed out vast amounts of<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/01/08/nx-s1-5252485/la-fire-air-quality\" target=\"_blank\"><u> smoke, ash and noxious gases</u></a> that spread across the city.</p>, <p>Indicators like the <a href=\"https://laist.com/news/health/air-quality-index-smoke\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Air Quality Index (AQI)</u></a>, commonly used to track air pollution levels, provide a rough sense of the pollution floating in the skies. But those types of indicators don't capture some of the other potentially health-damaging materials in the air that get released during fires. And many Angelenos have been wondering how to assess the risks to their health.</p>, <p>NPR spoke with health and wildfire smoke experts to answer some basic questions.<br/></p>, <p>The AQI incorporates measurements of five different air pollutants that the Environmental Protection Agency regulates: fine particles, ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. Decades of health science have demonstrated that such pollutants damage the health of those who breathe them in regularly. The AQI was designed to represent health risks from common pollutants, such as car exhaust or smog.</p>, <p>The EPA collects data for the AQI from some 4,000 air quality monitoring stations dotted around the country. But air quality can vary on a hyperlocal scale, meaning the network of official sites is \"fairly sparse,\" says <a href=\"https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/person/michael-jerrett/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Michael Jerrett</u></a>, an air pollution expert at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>, <p>\"They don't have the spatial density or indeed sometimes the temporal density to tell us what's really happening on the kind of localized level that really matters to people,\" he says.</p>, <p>The EPA created six color-coded categories from green (good, when the AQI is under 50) to<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2023/06/08/1180999595/wildfire-smoke-air-quality-index-purple\" target=\"_blank\"><u> maroon</u></a> (hazardous, when the metric exceeds 301, as it often does near actively burning wildfires).

      "Recommend reading Weinberg and Hanahan's Hallmarks of Cancer series of papers.The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumors. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list—reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the “tumor microenvironment.” Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.  https://www.cell.com/fulltext/...

'We don't usually think about the male partners' exposures'A new study suggests that air pollution can affect the fertility rates of all people, not just mothers or others who can bear children.What's happening?The Guardian reported on a study published in November that showed exposure to common air pollutants can hinder egg, sperm, and embryo development.The study included 500 egg donors and 915 male recipient partners. It found that all donors who were around higher levels of organic carbon and other particulate matter experienced lower rates of fertilization and egg survival.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency defines particulate matter as \"a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air.\" Its size and chemical composition vary, but many sources can emit them, including cars, trucks, fires, construction sites, and power plants.Why is this study important?Research about fertility has previously ignored potential harm to male fertility.\"We don't usually think about the male partners' exposures in the preconception window, but we and others are increasingly showing that male exposures are important, both in terms of fertility, and potentially later in child health outcomes,\" said Emory University researcher Audrey Gaskins, the study's lead author.Watch now: Meteorologist weighs in on why Hurricane Milton created so many tornadoesThough the study defined test subjects as female or male, it still proves that higher levels of pollution can affect anyone's fertility rate.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAnd this isn't the only connection between air pollution and health issues. Other studies have highlighted the link between high exposure to air pollution and conditions such as eczema and lung disease.What's being done about air pollution?The EPA lowered its threshold for acceptable amounts of particulate matter in February.Do you worry about air pollution in your town?   All the time      Often      Only sometimes      Never   Click your choice to see results and speak your mind.You may be able to get a tax credit via the Inflation Reduction Act to reduce air leaks in your home, which can also decrease the amount of outside pollution in your home.Further protect your health by using air purifiers. If you're worried about the cost, you can try making your own Corsi-Rosenthal box, which may be up to 50% cheaper than a commercial air purifier.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementMore in HealthA man in his 40s made 3 changes to his diet and workouts to build muscle, burn fat, and reboot his energyINSIDEREliminating These 3 Foods From Your Diet Can Be A Game-Changer For Heart HealthHuffPost LifeAnne Hathaway’s Trainer Says This One-Move Workout Builds Core Strength in Three MinutesWomen's HealthResearchers discover virus for the first time in new geographic region — here's what it means for the future of illnessesThe Cool DownIf you need to go outside on days when air pollution is high, scarves and cloth masks will not protect you from particulate matter.

An email sent to members of the EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB) and the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) informed them that the membership of both groups is being \"reset.\" Acting EPA administrator James Payne wrote in the email, viewed by NPR, that \"EPA is working to update these federal advisory committees to ensure that the agency receives scientific advice consistent with its legal obligations to advance our core mission.\" \n",

      "The decision comes in the wake of dozens of executive orders signed by President Trump during his first week in office that affect many aspects of federal policy, from immigration to climate and energy priorities. A request for nominations to refill the SAB and CASAC will be announced in the coming weeks, according to the email. \"I'm disappointed,\" says Barbara Turpin, a former member of CASAC and an air pollution expert at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and one of the committee members let go on Tuesday. But, she adds, \"I'm not surprised, because this happened last time Trump was president.\" During the first Trump administration, then-EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler dismissed CASAC members and dismantled panels tasked with reviewing science about air pollution. In 2021, during the Biden administration, then-EPA administrator Michael Regan replaced members from both science advisory panels, saying the move was necessary to \"reverse deficiencies\" in the advisory process during the first Trump term. In an email, a press officer for the EPA said Tuesday's move \"seeks to reverse the politicization of SAB and CASAC made by the previous Administration.\" A history of science advice The advisory committees were established in the 1970s. They are tasked with providing independent advice to the EPA's administrator, summarizing the best available science to help inform the agency's policy. Since a 1977 amendment to the Clean Air Act, the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, for example, takes input from panels of experts, primarily academic scientists. They summarize that input and provide guidance on the agency's National Ambient Air Quality Standards, which regulate the country's air pollution. \n",

      "The committee recently suggested the agency tighten standards for fine particle pollution, called PM 2.5. That pollution comes from many sources, including fossil fuel combustion and wildfire smoke, and has been linked to health risks, including a higher risk of cardiovascular problems and earlier onset of dementia. After the committee's recommendations, the agency adopted more stringent limits in 2024–the first update to the rules in more than a decade. CASAC was beginning to work on recommendations for updated standards on ozone, says Mary Rice, a pulmonologist and air pollution expert at Harvard University who was, until Tuesday, a member of CASAC. The Clean Air Act requires that the EPA set national air quality standards to \"protect public health with an adequate margin of safety,\" she says. \"I am concerned about whether the U.S. EPA will engage an advisory committee of scientists to ensure that the margin of safety is met for children, people with heart or lung disease, and older adults,\" she says.\n",

      "This story was originally published by Grist. Sign up for Grist’s weekly newsletter here. Earthâs oceans caught a fever in March 2023 that has yet to break. Since then, the bathwater-like conditions have killed corals in a record-breaking mass bleaching event, fueled hurricanes, and collapsed entire fisheries. The two years of heat have created a scientific mystery, with 450 straight days of record high global sea surface temperatures from April 2023 to July 2024 â a streak that exceeded climate scientistsâ predictions even when accounting for climate change and the natural climate pattern known as El NiÃ±o. A study published on Tuesday by researchers at the University of Reading helps solve the puzzle and points to one prominent culprit: the sun. The study in Environmental Research Letters found that the rate of ocean warming has more than quadrupled over the past 40 years, driven by Earthâs growing energy imbalance â accounting for roughly 44 percent of the extra heat in recent El NiÃ±o years. Thanks to heat-trapping greenhouse gases and a decrease in reflectivity, the planet is absorbing more energy from the sun than is escaping back into space. Since 2010, according to the study, that disparity has doubled. âThereâs been an uptick in that imbalance and that has led to an uptick in the rate of ocean warming,â said Christopher Merchant, a professor of ocean and earth observation at the University of Reading in the U.K. and the studyâs lead author. By looking back through satellite observations since 1985 and developing a statistical model that isolated the trends in both ocean warming and Earthâs energy imbalance, the researchers found they were escalating in lockstep. According to Merchant, the study is possibly the first to connect the two phenomena over recent decades. âItâs a very tight correlation,â he said. This relationship is bad news for the oceans, which have absorbed some 90 percent of the excess warming from human activity. Some of that heat will continue to seep down into the planetâs depths, while some will cycle back up toward the surface and escape into the atmosphere. According to the study, the next 20 years could warm up the oceans more than the last 40. If you think of the oceans as a bath, Merchant says, itâs like the hot tap was only a trickle in the 1980s â but now, itâs been cranked up. âAnd whatâs turning the tap more open, making the warming pick up speed, is an increase in greenhouse gases â carbon dioxide and methane â which are both still rising, largely from the fossil fuel industry,â he said. There are other factors turning up the heat. The El NiÃ±o pattern that began in 2023 added around 0.1 or 0.2 degrees Celsius, before the inverse La NiÃ±a pattern took over in December 2024.\n",

      " Another piece of the puzzle is the planetâs diminishing reflectivity, according to Brian McNoldy, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Miamiâs Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science. The oceanâs dark surface helps it absorb heat, whereas white clouds and aerosol particles in the atmosphere help bounce the sunâs radiation back into space. In 2020, the International Maritime Organization adopted a new rule to cut back on sulfur pollution from shipping fuel, but because the aerosol particles in emissions acted as a seed for clouds, the regulation had the unintended effect of dimming the marine layer of clouds that blanket the ocean. âSo you get rid of a lot of those, and now more of the sunâs energy can be absorbed in the ocean instead of reflecting off clouds,â McNoldy said. According to Merchant, efforts to curb air pollution from factories in countries like China also had the side effect of cutting back reflective aerosols.\n",

      "The excess ocean warmth has had wide-ranging consequences. In April 2024, as the oceans started simmering, 77 percent of the worldâs coral reefs became imperiled in the most extensive bleaching event on record, threatening the livelihoods of a billion people and a quarter of marine life. Changing ocean temperatures also shift weather patterns, potentially intensifying droughts, downpours, and storms alike. âHurricanes love warmer water. So all other things be equal, a warmer ocean can produce stronger hurricanes with maybe more frequent instances of rapid intensification,â McNoldy said. Last September, Hurricane Helene slammed into Floridaâs Gulf Coast after surging from a Category 1 to a Category 4 storm in a single day. âThe oceans really set the pace for global warming for the Earth as a whole,â Merchant said. The knock-on effects â like wildfires, drought, and floods â will continue to escalate, too. âThat really needs to be understood, but it also needs to filter through to governments that changes might be coming down the line faster than theyâre currently assuming.â This article originally appeared in Grist at https://grist.org/oceans/why-earth-oceans-record-hot-streak/.

Sign up for Grist’s <a href=\"https://go.grist.org/signup/weekly/partner?utm_campaign=republish-content&amp;utm_medium=syndication&amp;utm_source=partner\" title=\"Weekly newsletter\">weekly newsletter here</a>.</em></p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Earthâs oceans caught a fever in March 2023 that has yet to break. Since then, the bathwater-like conditions have killed corals in a record-breaking <a href=\"https://grist.org/science/coral-reefs-bleaching-climate-tipping-point/\">mass bleaching event</a>, <a href=\"https://grist.org/climate-energy/climate-change-atlantic-hurricanes-beryl-milton/\">fueled hurricanes</a>, and <a href=\"https://grist.org/food/alaska-snow-crab-vanish-st-paul-island/\">collapsed entire fisheries.</a></p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">The two years of heat have created <a href=\"https://grist.org/science/mysterious-x-factor-2023-heat-records/\">a scientific mystery</a>, with 450 straight days of record high global sea surface temperatures from April 2023 to July 2024 â a streak that exceeded climate scientistsâ predictions even when accounting for climate change and the natural climate pattern known as El NiÃ±o. A study published on Tuesday by researchers at the University of Reading helps solve the puzzle and points to one prominent culprit: the sun.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">The <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adaa8a\">study</a> in Environmental Research Letters found that the rate of ocean warming has more than quadrupled over the past 40 years, driven by Earthâs growing energy imbalance â accounting for roughly 44 percent of the extra heat in recent El NiÃ±o years. Thanks to heat-trapping <span class=\"tooltipsall tooltipsincontent classtoolTips1\">greenhouse gases</span> and a decrease in reflectivity, the planet is absorbing more energy from the sun than is escaping back into space. Since 2010, according to the study, that disparity has doubled.</p>, <p>âThereâs been an uptick in that imbalance and that has led to an uptick in the rate of ocean warming,â said Christopher Merchant, a professor of ocean and earth observation at the University of Reading in the U.K. and the studyâs lead author.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">By looking back through satellite observations since 1985 and developing a statistical model that isolated the trends in both ocean warming and Earthâs energy imbalance, the researchers found they were escalating in lockstep. According to Merchant, the study is possibly the first to connect the two phenomena over recent decades. âItâs a very tight correlation,â he said.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">This relationship is bad news for the oceans, which have absorbed some <a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-ocean-heat-content\">90 percent</a> of the excess warming from human activity. Some of that heat will continue to seep down into the planetâs depths, while some will cycle back up toward the surface and <a href=\"https://e360.yale.edu/features/how_long_can_oceans_continue_to_absorb_earths_excess_heat\">escape into the atmosphere.</a> According to the study, the next 20 years could warm up the oceans more than the last 40.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">If you think of the oceans as a bath, Merchant says, itâs like the hot tap was only a trickle in the 1980s â but now, itâs been cranked up. âAnd whatâs turning the tap more open, making the warming pick up speed, is an increase in greenhouse gases â carbon dioxide and <span class=\"tooltipsall tooltipsincontent classtoolTips3\">methane</span> â which are both still rising, largely from the fossil fuel industry,â he said.</p>, <p>There are other factors turning up the heat. The El NiÃ±o pattern that began in 2023 added around 0.1 or 0.2 degrees Celsius, before the inverse La NiÃ±a pattern took over in December 2024.</p>, <p>Another piece of the puzzle is the planetâs diminishing reflectivity, according to Brian McNoldy, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Miamiâs Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science. The oceanâs dark surface helps it absorb heat, whereas white clouds and aerosol particles in the atmosphere help bounce the sunâs radiation back into space. In 2020, the International Maritime Organization adopted a new rule to cut back on sulfur pollution from shipping fuel, but because the aerosol particles in emissions acted as a seed for clouds, the regulation had the unintended effect of dimming the marine layer of clouds that blanket the ocean.</p>, <p>âSo you get rid of a lot of those, and now more of the sunâs energy can be absorbed in the ocean instead of reflecting off clouds,â McNoldy said. According to Merchant, efforts to curb air pollution from factories in countries like China also had the side effect of <a href=\"https://e360.yale.edu/features/aerosols-warming-climate-change#:~:text=New%20research%20indicates%20that%20the,is%20also%20heating%20the%20atmosphere.\">cutting back reflective aerosols</a>.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">The excess ocean warmth has had wide-ranging consequences. In April 2024, as the oceans started simmering, 77 percent of the worldâs coral reefs became imperiled in the most extensive bleaching event on record, <a href=\"https://grist.org/science/coral-reefs-bleaching-climate-tipping-point/\">threatening the livelihoods of a billion people and a quarter of marine life</a>. Changing ocean temperatures also shift weather patterns, potentially intensifying droughts, downpours, and storms alike.</p>, <p>âHurricanes love warmer water. So all other things be equal, a warmer ocean can produce stronger hurricanes with maybe more frequent instances of rapid intensification,â McNoldy said. Last September, Hurricane Helene slammed into Floridaâs Gulf Coast after surging from a Category 1 to a Category 4 storm in a single day.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">âThe oceans really set the pace for global warming for the Earth as a whole,â Merchant said. The knock-on effects â like wildfires, drought, and floods â will continue to escalate, too. âThat really needs to be understood, but it also needs to filter through to governments that changes might be coming down the line faster than theyâre currently assuming.â</p>, <p><em>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"https://grist.org/\">Grist</a> at <a href=\"https://grist.org/oceans/why-earth-oceans-record-hot-streak/\">https://grist.org/oceans/why-earth-oceans-record-hot-streak/</a>.

human urine samples: 'We urgently need to classify [this]'Cassidy LovellThu, January 23, 2025 at 10:30 AM UTC2 min readScientists make disturbing new discovery while studying human urine samples: 'We urgently need to classify [this]'This common item is responsible for 25% of all microplastic pollution — and it's worse than we thought.What's happening?A recent study found high levels of two potentially deadly chemicals in human urine.The study sampled the urine of 150 people and had \"detection frequencies between 60% and 100%\" of chemical 6PPD and 6PPD-Q, which are rubber additives commonly used in tires.The long-term effects of 6PPD in humans hasn't been extensively studied, but what's clear to researchers is that 6PPD's source — tire-based pollution — is a big problem.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementIt's not easy to be exact, but studies estimate that tires create anywhere from 10-28% of the world's microplastic pollution, according to National Geographic. These particles don't just disappear — they end up in our water, our soil, and our bodies.Why are these findings important?As tires degrade, microplastic \"tire dust\" and toxic chemicals are released into the air.Watch now: Climate scientist dispels misconception that burning wood pollutes more than burning dirty energyThese tiny particles can easily invade waterways, with well-researched detrimental impacts on marine life. 6PPD specifically is known to quickly kill several types of fish, and the EPA recently suggested screening values to help protect salmon and other fish from tire pollution.Its toxicity in fish is alarming, and the study's researchers believe \"the potential human health risks posed by its long-term exposure require urgent attention.\"What's being done about tire pollution?Currently, tire pollution is lumped in with the rest of microplastics, and many don't realize tires are even a part of the problem. But as more studies reveal the harmful effects of tire pollution on our planet, our wildlife, and our bodies, change becomes more urgent.Do you worry about air pollution in your town?   All the time      Often      Only sometimes      Never   Click your choice to see results and speak your mind.Henry Obanya, a research student at the University of Portsmouth, said, \"We urgently need to classify tyre particles as a unique pollution category. … This approach would drive more focused research that could inform policies specifically designed to mitigate tyre pollution.\"Join our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.AdvertisementAbout Our AdsSolve the daily Crossword41,377 people played the daily Crossword recently.

      "Air pollution can have a cooling effect on the climateCheunghyo/Getty Images\n",
      "James Hansen, the climate scientist best known for alerting the US Congress to global warming in the 1980s, has redoubled his warnings that we are underestimating the climate impact of declining air pollution.\n",
      " Read moreJanuary 2025 sets surprise record as hottest ever start to a year \n",
      "“Humanity made a bad deal, a Faustian bargain, when we used aerosols to offset almost half of greenhouse gas warming,” said Hansen at a briefing hosted by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network.Advertisement\n",
      "But other researchers say this conclusion is based on shaky foundations, and we still don’t know how much reductions in air pollution are contributing to global warming. Hansen’s conclusions are “hovering around the top end of what we’d consider to be plausible”, says Michael Diamond at Florida State University, who wasn’t involved with the research.\n",
      "Record spikes in global average temperatures in 2023 and 2024 have spurred debate about whether the pace of global warming is accelerating faster than expected. Rising levels of greenhouse gases and a warming Pacific Ocean drove most of the temperature increase, but other unknown contributors pushed average temperatures even higher than can be explained by those factors alone.\n",
      "Hansen and his colleagues previously linked the accelerating rate of warming with a reduction in air pollution. Now they offer a new analysis arguing that a decline in air pollution can explain the spike in temperatures over the past two years. Aerosols in air pollution can both reflect sunlight away from Earth directly and affect the reflective properties of clouds – changes in cloud cover have also been implicated as a factor in the heat. \n",

      "The researchers focus in particular on the effect of a 2020 regulation that slashed the amount of harmful sulphur used in shipping fuels. That sudden drop in air pollution over the oceans has provided researchers with an unintended experiment that lets them determine the climate effects of aerosols with more precision.\n",
      "Hansen and his colleagues looked at busy shipping corridors in the Pacific Ocean to estimate this effect, measuring the change in solar radiation absorbed by the planet in those areas as air pollution declined. From this, they estimate that the drop in shipping aerosols increased the heat reaching Earth by 0.5 watts per square metre. That is roughly equivalent to the warming effect of a decade of global carbon dioxide emissions at today’s levels.\n",
      "That additional warming would be enough to account for the unexplained portion of the heat seen over the past two years, they found. But the implications are broader: it would also mean air pollution’s cooling effect has been masking the full extent of greenhouse gases’ warming effect – in other words, the warming experienced to date does not represent the full impact of our emissions.\n",
      "Hansen and his colleagues warn that this means the climate is much more sensitive than expected to rising levels of greenhouse gases. As a result, they argue, the world is more rapidly approaching climate tipping points, such as the slowdown of key Atlantic Ocean currents and the collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet. To combat this, they say we should more seriously consider how to cool the planet with interventions like solar geoengineering.\n",
      " The jet stream may be starting to shift in response to climate changeBands of fast-moving wind that blow west to east around the globe play a crucial role in weather – a poleward shift in parts of these jet streams could cause dramatic changes in weather from the western US to the Mediterranean \n",
      "However, the 0.5 watts per square metre number at the core of the new analysis is far higher than other estimates of the warming effect of the change in shipping emissions, says Tianle Yuan at the University of Maryland Baltimore County. But he says it is not completely implausible.\n",
      "Gavin Schmidt at NASA says the number is “very likely an overestimate” because it assumes all the change in absorbed sunlight is due to the change in shipping aerosols, rather than other changes like less air pollution from China or natural variability.\n",
      "A change in aerosols may not even be necessary to explain the 2023 temperature spike, says Shiv Priyam Raghuraman at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign – he previously found it can be explained by changes in Pacific Ocean temperatures alone. He says more work is needed to reconcile different estimates of the warming effects of aerosols.\n",

Hansen’s conclusions are “hovering around the top end of what we’d consider to be plausible”, says <a href=\"https://diamondclimate.wordpress.com/\">Michael Diamond</a> at Florida State University, who wasn’t involved with the research.</p>, <p>Record spikes in global <a href=\"/article/2463480-2024-confirmed-as-first-year-to-breach-1-5c-warming-limit/\">average temperatures in 2023 and 2024</a> have <a href=\"/article/2466649-january-2025-sets-surprise-record-as-hottest-ever-start-to-a-year/\">spurred debate</a> about whether the pace of global warming is accelerating faster than expected. Rising levels of greenhouse gases and a warming Pacific Ocean drove most of the temperature increase, but other unknown contributors pushed average temperatures even higher than can be explained by those factors alone.</p>, <p>Hansen and his colleagues <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/oocc/article/3/1/kgad008/7335889\">previously</a> linked the accelerating rate of warming with a reduction in air pollution. Now they offer a new analysis arguing that a decline in air pollution can explain the spike in temperatures over the past two years. Aerosols in air pollution can both reflect sunlight away from Earth directly and affect the reflective properties of clouds – changes in cloud cover <a href=\"/article/2458862-we-finally-have-an-explanation-for-2023s-record-breaking-temperatures/\">have also been implicated</a> as a factor in the heat.</p>, <p class=\"NewsletterPromotion__Copy\">Unmissable news about our planet delivered straight to your inbox every month.</p>, <p>The researchers focus in particular on the effect of a <a href=\"/article/2433564-cleaner-ship-emissions-may-warm-the-planet-far-faster-than-expected/\">2020 regulation that slashed the amount of harmful sulphur</a> used in shipping fuels. That sudden drop in air pollution over the oceans has provided researchers with an unintended experiment that lets them determine the climate effects of aerosols with more precision.</p>, <p>Hansen and his colleagues looked at busy shipping corridors in the Pacific Ocean to estimate this effect, measuring the change in solar radiation absorbed by the planet in those areas as air pollution declined. From this, they estimate that the drop in shipping aerosols increased the <a href=\"/article/2434235-earths-atmosphere-is-trapping-twice-as-much-heat-as-it-did-in-1993/\">heat reaching Earth</a> by 0.5 watts per square metre. That is roughly equivalent to the warming effect of a decade of global carbon dioxide emissions at today’s levels.</p>, <p>That additional warming would be enough to account for the unexplained portion of the heat seen over the past two years, they found. But the implications are broader: it would also mean air pollution’s cooling effect has been masking the full extent of greenhouse gases’ warming effect – in other words, the warming experienced to date does not represent the full impact of our emissions.</p>, <p>Hansen and his colleagues warn that this means the climate is much more sensitive than expected to rising levels of greenhouse gases. As a result, they argue, the world is more rapidly approaching climate tipping points, such as the slowdown of key <a href=\"/article/2456610-vital-atlantic-ocean-current-is-already-weakening-due-to-melting-ice/\">Atlantic Ocean currents</a> and the <a href=\"/article/2465998-antarctic-ice-sheet-may-be-less-vulnerable-to-collapse-than-expected/\">collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet</a>. To combat this, they say we should more seriously consider how to cool the planet with interventions like <a href=\"/article/2461498-is-solar-geoengineering-research-having-its-moment/\">solar geoengineering</a>.</p>, <p> <div class=\"ReadMoreWithImage\" data-companiontext=\"Read more\" data-id=\"2446877\" data-image=\"true\" data-img-src=\"2024/09/06195359/SEI_220340700.jpg\" data-link=\"/article/2446877-the-jet-stream-may-be-starting-to-shift-in-response-to-climate-change/\" data-linktext=\"The jet stream may be starting to shift in response to climate change\" data-straplinetext=\"Bands of fast-moving wind that blow west to east around the globe play a crucial role in weather – a poleward shift in parts of these jet streams could cause dramatic changes in weather from the western US to the Mediterranean\" data-template=\"standard\"><a class=\"ReadMoreWithImage__Link\" href=\"/article/2446877-the-jet-stream-may-be-starting-to-shift-in-response-to-climate-change/\"><div class=\"ReadMoreWithImage__ImageWrapper\"><div class=\"Image__Wrapper\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"Image lazyload\" data-caption=\"Caption: https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/3864/ he Polar Jet Stream Released Monday, October 3, 2011 Visualizations by: Trent L. Schindler View full credits Meandering around the planet like a rollicking roller coaster in the sky, the Northern Hemisphere's polar jet stream is a fast-moving belt of westerly winds that traverses the lower layers of the atmosphere. The jet is created by the convergence of cold air masses descending from the Arctic and rising warm air from the tropics. Deep troughs and steep ridges emerge as the denser cold air sinks and deflects warm air regions north, giving the jet stream its wavy appearance. This pattern propagates across the mid-latitudes of North America, Europe and Asia, as pockets of cold air sporadically creep down from the Arctic - creating contrasting waves and flows that accelerate eastward due to Earth's rotation. Running from June 10 to July 8 of 1988, the visualization below uses weather and climate observations from NASA's MERRA dataset to model nearly a month of the jet stream's whirling journey over North America.

      "AI-generated scientific research is polluting the online academic information ecosystem, according to a worrying report published in the Harvard Kennedy School’sÂ Misinformation Review. A team of researchers investigated the prevalence of research articles with evidence of artificially generated text on Google Scholar,Â an academic search engine that makes it easy to search for research published historically in a wealth of academic journals. The team specifically interrogated misuse of generative pre-trained transformers (or GPTs), a type of large language model (LLM) that includes now-familiar software such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT. These models are able to rapidly interpret text inputs and rapidly generate responses, in the form of figures, images, and long lines of text.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " In the research, the team analyzed a sample of scientific papers found on Google Scholar with signs of GPT-use. The selected papers contained one or two common phrases that conversational agents (commonly, chatbots) undergirded by LLMs use. The researchers then investigated the extent to which those questionable papers were distributed and hosted across the internet. “The risk of what we call ‘evidence hacking’ increases significantly when AI-generated research is spread in search engines,” said BjÃ¶rn EkstrÃ¶m, a researcher at the Swedish School of Library and Information Science, and co-author of the paper, in a University of BorÃ¥s release. “This can have tangible consequences as incorrect results can seep further into society and possibly also into more and more domains.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The way Google Scholar pulls research from around the internet, according to the recent team, does not screen out papers whose authors lack a scientific affiliation or peer-review; the engine will pull academic bycatchâstudent papers, reports, preprints, and moreâalong with the research that has passed a higher bar of scrutiny. The team found that two-thirds of the papers they studied were at least in part produced through undisclosed use of GPTs. Of the GPT-fabricated papers, the researchers found that 14.5% pertained to health, 19.5% pertained to the environment, and 23% pertained to computing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Most of these GPT-fabricated papers were found in non-indexed journals and working papers, but some cases included research published in mainstream scientific journals and conference proceedings,” the team wrote. The researchers outlined two main risks brought about by this development. “First, the abundance of fabricated ‘studies’ seeping into all areas of the research infrastructure threatens to overwhelm the scholarly communication system and jeopardize the integrity of the scientific record,” the group wrote. “A second risk lies in the increased possibility that convincingly scientific-looking content was in fact deceitfully created with AI tools and is also optimized to be retrieved by publicly available academic search engines, particularly Google Scholar.” Because Google Scholar is not an academic database, it is easy for the public to use when searching for scientific literature. That’s good. Unfortunately, it is harder for members of the public to separate the wheat from the chaff when it comes to reputable journals; even the difference between a piece of peer-reviewed research and a working paper can be confusing. Besides, the AI-generated text was found in some peer-reviewed works as well as those less-scrutinized write-ups, indicating that the GPT-fabricated work is muddying the waters throughout the online academic information systemânot just in the work that exists outside of most official channels.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“If we cannot trust that the research we read is genuine, we risk making decisions based on incorrect information,” said study co-author Jutta Haider, also a researcher at the Swedish School of Library and Information Science, in the same release. “But as much as this is a question of scientific misconduct, it is a question of media and information literacy.” In recent years, publishers have failed to successfully screen a handful of scientific articles that were actually total nonsense. In 2021, Springer Nature was forced to retract over 40 papers in the Arabian Journal of Geosciences, which despite the title of the journal discussed varied topics, including sports, air pollution, and children’s medicine. Besides being off-topic, the articles were poorly writtenâto the point of not making senseâand sentences often lacked a cogent line of thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Artificial intelligence is exacerbating the issue. Last February, the publisher Frontiers caught flak for publishing a paper in its journal Cell and Developmental Biology that included images generated by the AI software Midjourney; specifically, very anatomically incorrect images of signaling pathways and rat genitalia. Frontiers retracted the paper several days after its publication. AI models can be a boon to science; the systems can decode fragile texts from the Roman Empire, find previously unknown Nazca Lines, and reveal hidden details in dinosaur fossils. But AI’s impact can be as positive or negative as the human that wields it. Peer-reviewed journalsâand perhaps hosts and search engines for academic writingâneed guardrails to ensure that the technology works in service of scientific discovery, not in opposition to it.\n",

      "[<p>AI-generated scientific research is polluting the online academic information ecosystem, according to a worrying report <a href=\"https://misinforeview.hks.harvard.edu/article/gpt-fabricated-scientific-papers-on-google-scholar-key-features-spread-and-implications-for-preempting-evidence-manipulation/\">published</a> in the Harvard Kennedy School’sÂ <em>Misinformation Review</em>.</p>, <p>A team of researchers investigated the prevalence of research articles with evidence of artificially generated text on <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/\">Google Scholar</a>,Â an academic search engine that makes it easy to search for research published historically in a wealth of academic journals.</p>, <p>The team specifically interrogated misuse of generative pre-trained transformers (or GPTs), a type of large language model (LLM) that includes now-familiar software such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT. These models are able to rapidly interpret text inputs and rapidly generate responses, in the form of figures, images, and long lines of text.</p>, <p>In the research, the team analyzed a sample of scientific papers found on Google Scholar with signs of GPT-use. The selected papers contained one or two common phrases that <a href=\"https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/conversational-agent\">conversational agents</a> (commonly, chatbots) undergirded by LLMs use. The researchers then investigated the extent to which those questionable papers were distributed and hosted across the internet.</p>, <p>“The risk of what we call ‘evidence hacking’ increases significantly when AI-generated research is spread in search engines,” said BjÃ¶rn EkstrÃ¶m, a researcher at the Swedish School of Library and Information Science, and co-author of the paper, in a University of BorÃ¥s <a href=\"https://www.hb.se/en/about-ub/current/news-archive/2025/december/ai-fabricated-junk-science-floods-google-scholar/\">release</a>. “This can have tangible consequences as incorrect results can seep further into society and possibly also into more and more domains.”</p>, <p>The way Google Scholar pulls research from around the internet, according to the recent team, does not screen out papers whose authors lack a scientific affiliation or peer-review; the engine will pull academic bycatchâstudent papers, reports, preprints, and moreâalong with the research that has passed a higher bar of scrutiny.</p>, <p>The team found that two-thirds of the papers they studied were at least in part produced through undisclosed use of GPTs. Of the GPT-fabricated papers, the researchers found that 14.5% pertained to health, 19.5% pertained to the environment, and 23% pertained to computing.</p>, <p>“Most of these GPT-fabricated papers were found in non-indexed journals and working papers, but some cases included research published in mainstream scientific journals and conference proceedings,” the team wrote.</p>, <p>The researchers outlined two main risks brought about by this development. “First, the abundance of fabricated ‘studies’ seeping into all areas of the research infrastructure threatens to overwhelm the scholarly communication system and jeopardize the integrity of the scientific record,” the group wrote. “A second risk lies in the increased possibility that convincingly scientific-looking content was in fact deceitfully created with AI tools and is also optimized to be retrieved by publicly available academic search engines, particularly Google Scholar.”</p>, <p>Because Google Scholar is not an academic database, it is easy for the public to use when searching for scientific literature. That’s good. Unfortunately, it is harder for members of the public to separate the wheat from the chaff when it comes to reputable journals; even the difference between a piece of peer-reviewed research and a working paper can be confusing. Besides, the AI-generated text was found in some peer-reviewed works as well as those less-scrutinized write-ups, indicating that the GPT-fabricated work is muddying the waters throughout the online academic information systemânot just in the work that exists outside of most official channels.</p>, <p>“If we cannot trust that the research we read is genuine, we risk making decisions based on incorrect information,” said study co-author Jutta Haider, also a researcher at the Swedish School of Library and Information Science, in the same release. “But as much as this is a question of scientific misconduct, it is a question of media and information literacy.”</p>, <p>In recent years, publishers have failed to successfully screen a handful of scientific articles that were actually total nonsense. In 2021, Springer Nature was <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/science-publisher-retracts-44-papers-for-being-utter-no-1848004690\">forced to retract</a> over 40 papers in the <em>Arabian Journal of Geosciences</em>, which despite the title of the journal discussed varied topics, including sports, air pollution, and children’s medicine. Besides being off-topic, the articles were poorly writtenâto the point of not making senseâand sentences often lacked a cogent line of thought.</p>, <p>Artificial intelligence is <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/ai-fever-dream-it-s-only-getting-worse-1851279436\">exacerbating the issue</a>. Last February, the publisher Frontiers <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/rat-dck-among-gibberish-ai-images-published-in-science-1851260727\">caught flak</a> for publishing a paper in its journal <em>Cell</em> and <em>Developmental Biology</em> that included images generated by the AI software Midjourney; specifically, <em>very </em>anatomically incorrect images of signaling pathways and rat genitalia. Frontiers <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/science-journal-rat-dck-ai-generated-images-retracted-1851297606\">retracted the paper</a> several days after its publication.</p>, <p>AI models can be a boon to science; the systems can <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/ai-herculaneum-scrolls-computer-vision-transformers-2000481322\">decode fragile texts</a> from the Roman Empire, find <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/ai-survey-reveals-hundreds-of-nazca-line-geoglyphs-2000502668\">previously unknown Nazca Lines</a>, and <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/paleontologists-upset-ai-generated-art-dinosaurs-1851503634\">reveal hidden details</a> in dinosaur fossils. But AI’s impact can be as positive or negative as the human that wields it.</p>, <p>Peer-reviewed journalsâand perhaps hosts and search engines for academic writingâneed guardrails to ensure that the technology works in service of scientific discovery, not in opposition to it.</p>, <p class=\"post-tags\">\n",

common insects: 'Could be catastrophic'Beth NewhartMon, February 10, 2025 at 10:45 AM UTC2 min readScientists set the record straight on one of Earth's most common insects: 'Could be catastrophic'Flies might not come to mind when you think of threatened species in need of protection, but research has proved that they are a vital part of our ecosystems.What's happening?It may seem like there are plenty of flies buzzing around everywhere, but they're actually facing risks from rising global temperatures, according to a report from Penn State.In tests done by the researchers, flies were less tolerant to high temperatures than bees. Bees can adapt to more habitats and sustain hotter tropical living conditions, and flies are more vulnerable to the changing and warming climate.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementBoth insects are crucial pollinators that contribute to the diversity, health, and reproduction of wild plants and agricultural crops.\"It's time we gave flies some more recognition [for] their role as pollinators,\" said Margarita López-Uribe, lead author on the study and professor at Penn State. \"Flies have a significant role, but they don't get as much attention — and they are vulnerable in all the same ways that bees are.\"Why are pollinators important?Without pollinators, much of the global food supply would collapse. About 75% of all flowering plants and 35% of all food crops depend on animal pollinators to reproduce, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.Watch now: Netflix chef and bestselling author talks about why she's in love with new cooking technique\"In alpine and subarctic environments, flies are the primary pollinator,\" López-Uribe said. \"This study shows us that we have entire regions that could lose their primary pollinator as the climate warms, which could be catastrophic for those ecosystems.\"AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementTemperature isn't the only thing affecting pollination. Pollution caused by humans throughout the day and night is also negatively impacting the process. Air pollution is so bad that it's preventing moths from being able to pick up the scent of wildflowers.What can you do to help?There are government programs in place to protect pollinators, though many of them are focused on the most threatened species, like bees and bats.Should the government be paying people to hunt invasive species?   Definitely      Depends on the animal      No way      Just let people do it for free   Click your choice to see results and speak your mind.\"In all, there are over 100 crops grown in the United States that depend on pollination,\" the USDA said. \"USDA supports the critical role pollinators play in agriculture through research and data collections, diagnostic services and pollinator health monitoring, pollinator habitat enhancement programs, and pollinator health grants.\"Homeowners can do their part to encourage pollination by installing native plants that are welcoming to local pollinators and avoiding harmful pesticides in their gardens.Join our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.AdvertisementAbout Our AdsSolve the daily Crossword41,377 people played the daily Crossword recently.

The shock wave from this explosion damaged thousands of buildings, and almost 1,500 people were injured by broken glass and other debris. The explosion was more powerful than a nuclear bomb, and it was so bright that it briefly outshone the sun! No one saw this giant space rock coming. At 60 feet in diameter, it was the largest thing to fall from space in more than 100 years.

A new study published in the Environmental Research Health journal recently laid out how electric cars replacing gas-powered ones leads to better air quality and a variety of health benefits.The study focused on New York City, creating mathematical models for what would happen if all of the cars sold in the city were electric. The models showed that the number of health problems that could be avoided in such a scenario was tremendous.\"We find that [...] establishing 100% on-road electric [medium- and heavy-duty vehicles] by 2040 would prevent over $2.4 billion in health damages in 2040,\" the study's authors wrote.Do you think a majority of Americans will have EVs in 20 years?   Absolutely      Only in some states      No way      I'm not sure   Click your choice to see results and speak your mind.\"Most avoidable health costs would be achieved through reductions in traffic-related air-pollutant-attributable mortality and pediatric asthma ED visits. ... In addition to avoided asthma ED visits, the reduction of [nitrous oxide] concentrations in both scenarios show substantial impacts on the avoidance of new pediatric asthma cases and pediatric asthma exacerbations.\"AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementThis is not the first study to reach similar conclusions — a recent report from the University of Toronto showed that switching to electric cars throughout the United States could save up to $188 billion in health costs by 2050.While much is made — and rightfully so — of the planet-overheating effects of the air pollution caused by gas-burning cars, we tend to hear less about the individual human costs of this pollution.Watch now: Honda reveals how it's rethinking electric vehicles from the ground up with exciting new concept carsHowever, it is no less devastating. As both studies explained, air pollution from gas-powered cars directly results in poor air quality, which in turn leads to asthma (particularly pediatric asthma) and other respiratory illnesses.Luckily for New York City, the focus of the first study, residents in Manhattan already have less air pollution to deal with thanks to the recently implemented congestion pricing, which encourages less polluting travel choices by charging drivers a $9 toll for entering the most congested parts of the borough by car.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementJoin our free newsletter for weekly updates on the latest innovations improving our lives and shaping our future, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.AdvertisementAbout Our AdsSolve the daily Crossword41,377 people played the daily Crossword recently.

      "The rapid unscheduled disassembly (aka explosion) of SpaceX's Starship megarocket that rained scorching fragments of metal across the Caribbean in mid-January may have released significant amounts of harmful air-pollution into the upper layers of Earth's atmosphere.The rocket's upper stage blew up at an altitude of around 90 miles (146 kilometers) according to astronomer and space debris expert Jonathan McDowell, and weighed some 85 tons without propellant. Its plunge back to Earth through the atmosphere may have generated 45.5 metric tons of metal oxides and 40 metric tons of nitrogen oxides, according to University College London atmospheric chemistry researcher Connor Barker. Nitrogen oxides in particular are known for their potential to damage Earth's protective ozone layer.Barker, who had recently published an inventory of rocket emissions and pollutants from satellite re-entries in the journal Nature, posted the estimates on his LinkedIn profile shortly after the mishap. He, however, stressed in an email to Space.com that the numbers are a rough, preliminary estimate rather than an accurate calculation of the accident's environmental impact.In Barker's LinkedIn post, however, the scientist said that the amount of metallic air pollution potentially produced in the accident equals that generated by one third of meteorite material that burns up in Earth's atmosphere every year.\n",

      "Exactly how much pollution the Starship mishap produced in the higher atmosphere is hard to tell. Scientists, for example, are also not sure how much of the megarocket's mass burned up and how much of it fell to Earth.McDowell told Space.com that \"many tons\" likely splashed down into the ocean.Fortunately, the Starship upper stage is made of stainless steel and not aluminum like satellites and upper stages of many other rockets including SpaceX's Falcon 9. The incineration of aluminum is what worries many scientists. When aluminum burns at high temperatures during a satellite re-entry, it produces aluminum oxides, or alumina, a white powdery substance known for its potential to damage ozone and change the reflectiveness of Earth's atmosphere.Get the Space.com NewsletterBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.In recent years, the number of satellites orbiting Earth and that of subsequent atmospheric re-entries has been rising fast. With that the amount of alumina released into the mesosphere and upper stratosphere — the otherwise pristine middle layers of the atmosphere — has been skyrocketing. Air pollution in the mesosphere and upper stratosphere concerns scientists as the high altitudes at which it arises mean the pollutants remain in the air for a very long time.Scientists think that the quantity of alumina from incinerated satellites is already approaching the same levels that result from the atmospheric demise of natural space rocks such as asteroids or meteoroids, which contain only trace amounts of aluminum. The amount of nitrogen oxides produced during re-entries is also nearing that generated by natural space rocks.Related Stories:Watch SpaceX Starship explode over Atlantic Ocean on Flight Test 7 (videos)FAA requiring investigation into SpaceX Starship's Flight 7 explosionSpaceX catches Super Heavy booster on Starship Flight 7 test but loses upper stage (video, photos)Nitrogen oxides arise as space rocks or space debris fragments, travelling at hyper-sonic speeds, compress the surrounding air as they fall to Earth. The atoms of nitrogen heat up and react with oxygen, creating the harmful oxides.With the expected increase in rocket launches and the growth of satellite fleets and the subsequent frequency of re-entries, concentrations of these damaging gases and particles could quickly rise. The pollutants could thwart the recovery of the planet's ozone layer, worsening the damage caused by ozone-depleting substances used in aerosol sprays and refrigerators in the past. The air pollution from incinerated satellites could also change how much heat the Earth's atmosphere retains, leading to possibly serious consequences on the planet's climate.\n",

      "I reread the article and my own critical comment, and stand by my comment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Part of the problem is, as I already posted, the headline. It clearly uses a \"click bait\" approach - using the explosion of the StarShip mainly to introduce the topic, which seems to be more related to other space vehicles doing routine reentries.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can all agree that StarShips should not explode in the atmosphere - even Elon. Nobody wants that to be happening routinely.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, there is further ambiguity that probably results from the media author - not the scientist. And it seems to be intentionally misleading.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second paragraph only says that the scientist estimate that the explosion released \"45.5 metric tons of metal oxides and 40 metric tons of nitrogen oxides\". The next paragraph quotes the scientist as saying \"The amount of metallic air pollution potentially produced in the accident equals that generated by one third of meteorite material that burns up in Earth's atmosphere every year.\" Note that these paragraphs are speaking of total metals, not the aluminum content.  There is no comparison of the amount of aluminum released by the StarShip explosion to the amount of aluminum that enters Earth's atmosphere annually. \n",
      "\n",
      "The article does say, a couple of paragraphs later, \"Fortunately, the Starship upper stage is made of stainless steel and not aluminum like satellites and upper stages of many other rockets including SpaceX's Falcon 9. The incineration of aluminum is what worries many scientists.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But, the article never says what amount of aluminum oxide was released by the StarShip explosion compared to naturally occurring meteors. On careful reading, one might conclude zero alumina was released by StarShip because it was built with stainless steel. But, what sticks in the mind is the \"one third of meteorite material\" for all metals. \n",
      "\n",
      "That is a rhetorical trick, much used by lawyers, politicians, biased journalists and others with agendas they are trying to sell. It is called \"misdirection\" instead of \"lying\" because it tends to make people think they heard something you did not actually say but want them to believe. Their defense when caught is \"I didn't say that!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So, as an objective scientist, I want to know how much alumina the StarShip explosion put into the atmosphere, and how that compares with the natural annual input of alumina from meteors. Since that is the issue the article is worried about, that is that information it should have provided, considering the headline it has, making the StarShip explosion appear to be the main subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, the amount of nitrogen oxides produced by the explosion should have been compared to the amount produce naturally by meteors. That was sort of addressed by the statement \"The amount of nitrogen oxides produced during re-entries is also nearing that generated by natural space rocks.\" But, again, is this more misdirection? That statement appears to be referring to all of spacecraft reentering the atmosphere, not the StarShip explosion.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, the article really doesn't even address whether the amount of nitrogen oxides produced by the planned, intact reentry of a StarShip is any different from what was generated due to the explosion. Again, the article seemingly relates the creation of the nitrogen oxides to the explosion, tending to make it read like the nitrogen oxides were carried by the StarShip. But, in fact, it was all made from the oxygen and nitrogen that was already in the upper atmosphere - and doesn't even address how that compares to the amount that would have been created by the reentry of the intact StarShip.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, what is really accomplished by this article in the way of properly informing the readership about potentially important issues? Not much. It raises the issues, but really does not put them into properly useable perspectives. It does explicitly mention SpaceX and StarShip in that context, without putting them into perspective with the other launchers who also contribute.\n",
      "\n",
      "I challenge the authors and editors of Space.com to provide an objective, fact-based and well referenced article on the subject with a headline of \"Launch and Reentry Effects on Earth's Upper Atmosphere In Perspective\". Maybe if they read the articles from other sources, such as https://phys.org/space-news/ , they can get a better feel for the desired journalistic approach. And look for potentially positive effects to the same degree as the potentially negative effects. Just mentioning the possibility of a positive effect and then dwelling on the negative effects is a common human tendency, but it is not objective.\n",

With that the amount of alumina released into the mesosphere and upper stratosphere — the otherwise pristine middle layers of the atmosphere — has been skyrocketing.

But that extra blast of heat from El Niño against the background of climate change meant natural carbon sinks on land did not take up as much CO2 as usual last year.Rampant wildfires, including in regions not usually affected by El Niño, also released extra CO2.\"Even without the boost from El Niño last year, the CO2 rise driven by fossil fuel burning and deforestation would now be outpacing the [UN climate body] IPCC's 1.5C scenarios,\" says Prof Betts.These factors meant that between 2023 and 2024 CO2 levels increased by nearly 3.6 parts per million (ppm) molecules of air to a new high of more than 424ppm.This is a record yearly increase since atmospheric measurements were first taken at the remote Mauna Loa research station in Hawaii in 1958. Perched high on the side of a volcano in the Pacific Ocean, the station's remote location away from major pollution sources makes it ideally suited to monitoring global CO2 levels.\"These latest results further confirm that we are moving into uncharted territory faster than ever as the rise continues to accelerate,\" says Prof Ralph Keeling, who leads the measurement programme at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in the US.AFPDrought, wildfires and deliberate deforestation have made the Amazon rainforest less able to absorb CO2The record increase adds to concerns that the natural world may become less able to absorb planet-warming gases in the long-term.The Arctic tundra is being transformed into an overall source of CO2, thanks to warming and frequent fires, according to the US science group NOAA.The ability of the Amazon rainforest to absorb CO2 is also being hit by drought, wildfires and deliberate deforestation.\"It's an open question, but it's something we need to keep a close eye on and look at very carefully,\" Prof Betts tells the BBC.The Met Office predicts the increase in CO2 concentration in 2025 will be less extreme than 2024, but still significantly off-track to meet the 1.5C target.La Niña conditions – where surface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean are cooler than normal - have replaced El Niño, which tends to allow the natural world to take up more CO2.\"While there may be a temporary respite with slightly cooler temperatures, warming will resume because CO2 is still building up in the atmosphere,\" Prof Betts says.More on climate changeClimate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA firesFour ways climate change worsens extreme weatherWhat does net zero mean?Sign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

Fast Company explains:“As AI becomes more deeply embedded in daily life, the resulting air pollution in the form of lung-penetrating fine particles and other federally regulated pollutants, including nitrogen oxides, is only expected to increase.

The town has been tense since containers holding 337 tonnes of toxic waste from the site of one of the world's worst industrial disasters arrived for disposal three weeks ago.The waste, transported from the now-defunct Union Carbide factory in the city of Bhopal - site of the 1984 gas tragedy that killed thousands - has sparked fears among locals.They worry that disposing of it near their homes could be harmful and even cause an environmental disaster.Protests erupted on 3 January, a day after the waste arrived in the town, escalating into stone-throwing and attempted self-immolations.Since then, heavy police patrols near the disposal facility have turned Tarapur and surrounding areas into a virtual garrison.The police have registered seven cases against 100 people since the protests began, but the townspeople continue to raise concerns about industrial pollution at smaller community meetings.Pithampur's land and water are already contaminated due to rapid industrialisationThe toxic waste cleared from the Bhopal factory included five types of hazardous materials - including pesticide residue and \"forever chemicals\" left from its manufacturing process. These chemicals are so-named because they retain their toxic properties indefinitely. Over the decades, these chemicals have seeped into the surrounding environment, creating a health hazard for people living around the factory in Bhopal.But officials dismiss fears of the waste disposal causing environmental issues in Pithampur.Senior official Swatantra Kumar Singh outlined the staggered process in an attempt to reassure the public.\"Hazardous waste will be incinerated at 1,200C (2,192F), with 90kg (194.4lb) test batches followed by 270kg batches over three months if toxicity levels are safe,\" he said.Mr Singh explained that a \"four-layer filtering will purify smoke\", which will prevent toxins from entering the air and the residue from incineration will be \"sealed in a two layer membrane\" and \"buried in a specialised landfill\" to prevent soil and groundwater contamination.\"We've trained 100 'master trainers' and are hosting sessions to explain the disposal process and build public trust,\" said administrator Priyank Mishra.Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav has also defended the waste disposal, calling it both safe and necessary. He urged residents to voice their concerns legally, noting that the disposal was carried out only after orders from the high court.Environmental experts, however, have differing views on the process. Some like Subhash C Pandey believe the disposal poses no risk if done properly. Others, like Shyamala Mani, are calling for alternatives to incineration. She argues that incineration increases residual slag and releases harmful toxins like mercury and dioxins. Ms Mani suggests that bioremediation, a process using micro-organisms to break down harmful substances in waste, could be a more effective and eco-friendly solution.But residents remain sceptical.  Residents of Pithampur have protested against the disposal of the waste \"It's not just waste. It's poison,\" said Gayatri Tiwari, a mother of five in Tarapur village. \"What's the point of life if we can't breathe clean air or drink clean water?\"Pollution is an undeniable reality for the residents of Pithampur. Residents cite past groundwater contamination and ongoing health issues as reasons for scepticism.The town's rapid industrial growth in the 1980s led to hazardous waste build-up, contaminated water and soil with mercury, arsenic and sulphates. By 2017, the federal agency Central Pollution Control Bureau flagged severe pollution in the area.Locals allege that many companies don't follow the rules to dispose of non-hazardous waste, choosing to dump it in the soil or water. Tests in 2024 showed elevated harmful substances in water. Activists link this to alleged environmental violations at the disposal facility but officials have denied this.\"Water filters in our homes don't last two months. Skin diseases and kidney stones are common now. Pollution has made life unbearable,\" said Pankaj Patel, 32, from Chirakhan village, pointing to his water purifier which needs frequently replacing.Srinivas Dwivedi, regional officer of the State Pollution Control Board, dismissed concerns, saying it's \"unrealistic\" to expect pre-industrial conditions in Pithampur.Getty ImagesBhopal's now-defunct Union Carbide factory - the site of the 1984 gas tragedy Meanwhile, in Bhopal, nearly 230km (143 miles) away from Pithampur, activists argue that the disposal process is a distraction from much larger issues. Since the disaster, the toxic material lay in the mothballed factory for decades, polluting groundwater in the surrounding areas.More than 1.1 million tonnes of contaminated soil remain at the Union Carbide factory site, according to a 2010 report by National Environmental Engineering Research Institute and the National Geophysical Research Institute.\"The government is making a show of disposing of 337 metric tonnes while ignoring the much bigger problem in Bhopal,\" said Nityanand Jayaraman, a leading environmentalist. \"The contamination has worsened over the years, yet the government has done little to address it,\" added Rachna Dhingra, another activist.Government estimates say 3,500 people died shortly after the gas leak, with over 15,000 dying later. Activists claim the toll is much higher, with victims still suffering from the side effects of the poisoning.\"Given Pithampur's history of pollution, residents' fears are valid,\" said Mr Jayaraman.Officials said they are only \"dealing with the waste as specified by the court's directive\". But the reality of Bhopal has deepened the mistrust among the people of Pithampur, who are now prepared to take to the streets again to oppose the waste disposal. Vegetable vendor Shivnarayan Dasana said the issue goes beyond the waste itself.\"It's about survival - ours and our children's,\" he said.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.AsiaIndiaRelatedSouth Korean actress Kim Sae-ron, 24, found dead2 hrs agoAsiaFamilies heartbreak after deadly Delhi railway station crush6 hrs agoAsiaS Korea striker gets suspended jail term for filming secret sex videos2 days agoEnglandMore13 hrs agoEighteen killed in New Delhi station crush Eyewitnesses tell the BBC a \"huge crowd\" had gathered at the Indian capital's central train station.13 hrs agoAsia16 hrs ago'I believe in my guide runner more than myself', says blind Indian athleteTwo of India’s top visually impaired female athletes share the challenges of finding the perfect guide runner.16 hrs agoAsia2 days agoIndia anger as judge frees man accused of raping wife who then diedThe controversial ruling once again shines a spotlight on the issue of marital rape in India, which refuses to criminalise it.2 days agoAsia2 days agoYour essential guide to the ICC Champions TrophyThe ICC Champions Trophy returns after eight years on 19 February - here's everything you need to know about how it works. 2 days agoCricket2 days agoFive key takeaways from Modi-Trump talksModi and Trump rekindle ties amid a global trade war, balancing tariffs, trade deals and strategic interests.2 days agoWorldBritish Broadcasting CorporationHomeNewsSportBusinessInnovationCultureArtsTravelEarthAudioVideoLiveWeatherBBC ShopBBC in other languagesFollow BBC on:Terms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpContact the BBCAdvertise with usDo not share or sell my infoContact technical supportCopyright 2025 BBC.

Pollution has made life unbearable,\" said Pankaj Patel, 32, from Chirakhan village, pointing to his water purifier which needs frequently replacing.<!-- --></p>, <p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe\">Srinivas Dwivedi, regional officer of the State Pollution Control Board, dismissed concerns, saying it's \"unrealistic\" to expect pre-industrial conditions in Pithampur.<!-- --></p>, <p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe\">Meanwhile, in Bhopal, nearly 230km (143 miles) away from Pithampur, activists argue that the disposal process is a distraction from much larger issues. <!-- --></p>, <p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe\">Since the disaster, the toxic material lay in the mothballed factory for decades, polluting groundwater in the surrounding areas.<!-- --></p>, <p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe\">More than 1.1 million tonnes of contaminated soil remain at the Union Carbide factory site, according to a 2010 report by National Environmental Engineering Research Institute and the National Geophysical Research Institute.<!-- --></p>, <p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe\">\"The government is making a show of disposing of 337 metric tonnes while ignoring the much bigger problem in Bhopal,\" said Nityanand Jayaraman, a leading environmentalist. <!-- --></p>, <p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe\">\"The contamination has worsened over the years, yet the government has done little to address it,\" added Rachna Dhingra, another activist.<!-- --></p>, <p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe\">Government estimates say 3,500 people died shortly after the gas leak, with over 15,000 dying later. Activists claim the toll is much higher, with victims still suffering from the side effects of the poisoning.<!-- --></p>, <p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe\">\"Given Pithampur's history of pollution, residents' fears are valid,\" said Mr Jayaraman.<!-- --></p>, <p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe\">Officials said they are only \"dealing with the waste as specified by the court's directive\". <!-- --></p>, <p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe\">But the reality of Bhopal has deepened the mistrust among the people of Pithampur, who are now prepared to take to the streets again to oppose the waste disposal. <!-- --></p>, <p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe\">Vegetable vendor Shivnarayan Dasana said the issue goes beyond the waste itself.<!-- --></p>, <p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe\">\"It's about survival - ours and our children's,\" he said.<!-- --></p>, <p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe\"><i class=\"sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog\" id=\"follow-bbc-news-india-on\">Follow BBC News India on <!-- --></i><a class=\"sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\" target=\"_blank\"><i class=\"sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog\" id=\"instagram\">Instagram<!-- --></i></a><i class=\"sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog\" id=\",\">, <!-- --></i><a class=\"sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\" target=\"_blank\"><i class=\"sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog\" id=\"youtube,\">YouTube,<!-- --></i></a><i class=\"sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog\" id=\"\"> <!-- --></i><a class=\"sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\" target=\"_blank\"><i class=\"sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog\" id=\"twitter\">Twitter<!-- --></i></a><i class=\"sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog\" id=\"and\"> and <!-- --></i><a class=\"sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\" target=\"_blank\"><i class=\"sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog\" id=\"facebook\">Facebook<!-- --></i></a><i class=\"sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog\" id=\".\">.<!-- --></i></p>, <p class=\"sc-ae29827d-0 cNPpME\" data-testid=\"card-description\">Eyewitnesses tell the BBC a \"huge crowd\" had gathered at the Indian capital's central train station.</p>, <p class=\"sc-ae29827d-0 cNPpME\" data-testid=\"card-description\">Two of India’s top visually impaired female athletes share the challenges of finding the perfect guide runner.</p>, <p class=\"sc-ae29827d-0 cNPpME\" data-testid=\"card-description\">The controversial ruling once again shines a spotlight on the issue of marital rape in India, which refuses to criminalise it.</p>, <p class=\"sc-ae29827d-0 cNPpME\" data-testid=\"card-description\">The ICC Champions Trophy returns after eight years on 19 February - here's everything you need to know about how it works. </p>, <p class=\"sc-ae29827d-0 cNPpME\" data-testid=\"card-description\">Modi and Trump rekindle ties amid a global trade war, balancing tariffs, trade deals and strategic interests.</p>, <p class=\"sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe\">Copyright 2025 BBC.

      "Trump is planning executive orders aligned with his \"energy dominance\" agenda.His top priorities are expanding fossil fuel exports and drilling on federal lands and waters.Trump may hit roadblocks in Congress and the courts in trying to roll back climate rules.President-elect Donald Trump is expected to make a big push for fossil fuels on January 20 through a series of executive orders aimed at boosting US oil and gas production and rolling back the Biden administration's climate rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the first day of his second term, Trump could direct federal agencies to approve new terminals to export liquified natural gas (LNG) and start unwinding restrictions on oil and gas leasing on federal lands and waters, several fossil fuel industry lobbying groups helping shape Trump's energy agenda said.\"On day one, we're excited about them lifting the LNG pause, which has been so damaging to the American LNG industry and our reliable trade partners overseas,\" Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, told reporters at an event in Washington, DC on January 14. He added that many executive orders will instruct federal agencies to restore America's focus on \"energy dominance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Other targets include Biden-era regulations that encourage the shift to electric vehicles, including curbs on tailpipe pollution and a federal waiver allowing California to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. Trump may also toss out Biden's executive order from 2021 directing federal agencies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across their buildings, vehicles, and supply chains.Trump campaigned on a promise to \"drill, baby, drill\" and \"unleash Americans' energy production,\" even with the US already producing a record amount of oil and gas and being the world's largest exporter. Industry executives, employees, and corporate political action committees donated more than $32 million to Trump's campaign, data tracked by Open Secrets shows.But many of the industry's priorities can't be accomplished with an executive order alone, either because Congress has to change laws or federal agencies have to undertake lengthy rulemaking processes. Attempts to roll back Biden's climate rules will likely be challenged in court, as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When he takes office, President Trump will make America energy dominant again, protect our energy jobs, and bring down the cost of living for working families,\" Karoline Leavitt, spokesperson for the Trump transition team, said.Here's what fossil fuel groups said could happen quickly in the new administration.\n",

      "Greenlighting new gas terminalsTrump can direct the Energy Department to start approving new permits for LNG terminals immediately via executive order, said Kenny Stein, vice president for policy at the American Energy Alliance, a conservative group advising Trump's energy agenda.\n",
      "\n",
      "The move would end a temporary pause the Biden administration instituted in January 2024 so the Energy Department could study the impacts of more LNG exports on the economy, national security, and the climate crisis.The API argued that the pause threatens global energy security and US competitiveness overseas and will cost jobs at home. In December, the Energy Department found that the US is already on track to double LNG exports to 2028 under approved projects, and continuing to approve new projects will increase greenhouse gas emissions fueling the climate crisis.Environmental groups are expected to challenge new LNG permits in court and could cite the Energy Department's study.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oil and gas leases on federal land and waterTrump has repeatedly promised to unwind limits that the Biden administration's Interior Department placed on oil and gas drilling in areas like the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska.Trump is expected to direct the Interior Department to revise a five-year offshore leasing plan finalized by the Biden administration. The plan scheduled three auctions between 2024 and 2029 — a record low compared to the 47 sales proposed during Trump's first term.In Alaska, the president-elect also wants to further open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the National Petroleum Reserve to fossil fuel development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Biden in 2023 approved ConocoPhillips' massive Willow oil drilling project in the National Petroleum Reserve, but then made tens of millions of acres of the reserve off-limits to drilling to protect wildlife habitat.During Trump's first term, Congress also directed the Interior Department to open Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling for the first time. The Biden administration auctioned off 400,000 acres in January, the smallest amount allowed under the law, but it didn't attract a bidder. An auction in the final weeks of the Trump administration also didn't attract interest from any oil majors.The state of Alaska sued the Biden administration over the sale, arguing that the area's size and additional restrictions made oil drilling economically unviable. The Trump administration could potentially expand the sale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Targeting EVsTrump is also expected to direct the EPA and Transportation Department to start reviewing and rewriting regulations that encourage the shift to electric vehicles.\"I will end the electric vehicle mandate on day one,\" Trump said during a speech at the Republican National Convention in July. \"Thereby saving the US auto industry from complete obliteration, which is happening right now, and saving US customers thousands and thousands of dollars per car.\"There are no federal EV mandates, however. In March, the EPA finalized tailpipe pollution limits for cars, SUVs, and trucks sold between 2027 and 2032, which are the strictest to date. The Biden administration said this could boost electric vehicles to up to 56% of new car sales, while hybrids could account for about 13% of sales as automakers adjust production to meet the new standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump is likely to go after California's recent move to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. Under the Clean Air Act, the state can set more stringent limits on tailpipe pollution than the federal government as long as it's granted a waiver from the EPA. The agency in December greenlighted California's plan to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, which the Trump administration is expected to revoke — similar to a fight with California over the waiver in his first term.That would likely set up a legal fight with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has moved to \"Trump-proof\" the state and vowed to defend the state's EV and climate policies.\n",

The Biden administration auctioned off 400,000 acres in January, the smallest amount allowed under the law, but it didn't attract a bidder. An auction in the final weeks of the Trump administration also didn't attract interest from any oil majors.</p>, <p>The state of Alaska <a data-analytics-product-module=\"body_link\" href=\"https://law.alaska.gov/press/releases/2025/010725-ANWR.html\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\">sued the Biden administration</a> over the sale, arguing that the area's size and additional restrictions made oil drilling economically unviable. The Trump administration could potentially expand the sale.</p>, <p>Trump is also expected to direct the EPA and Transportation Department to start reviewing and rewriting regulations that encourage the shift to electric vehicles.</p>, <p>\"I will end the electric vehicle mandate on day one,\" Trump said <a data-analytics-product-module=\"body_link\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/us/politics/trump-rnc-speech-transcript.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">during a speech at the Republican National Convention</a> in July. \"Thereby saving the US auto industry from complete obliteration, which is happening right now, and saving US customers thousands and thousands of dollars per car.\"</p>, <p>There are no federal EV mandates, however. In March, the EPA finalized tailpipe pollution limits for cars, SUVs, and trucks sold between 2027 and 2032, which are the strictest to date. The Biden administration said this could boost electric vehicles to up to 56% of new car sales, while hybrids could account for about 13% of sales as automakers adjust production to meet the new standards.</p>, <p>Trump is likely to go after California's recent move to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. Under the Clean Air Act, the state can set more stringent limits on tailpipe pollution than the federal government as long as it's granted a waiver from the EPA. The agency in December greenlighted California's plan to <a data-analytics-product-module=\"body_link\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trumps-evs-california-implications-for-the-entire-auto-industry-2024-12\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\">ban the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035</a>, which the Trump administration is expected to revoke — similar to a fight with California over the waiver in his first term.</p>, <p>That would likely set up a legal fight with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has moved to \"Trump-proof\" the state and vowed to defend the state's EV and climate policies.</p>, <p>Jump to</p>]\n",

Jo-Anne McArthur/We AnimalsSam Delgado is a Future Perfect fellow writing about labor and food systems, public health, and literacy.In communities living next to factory farms, residents have long voiced their concerns about environmental pollution. Now, research shows that not only can we see the air pollution generated by industrial swine facilities, but we can see that it’s disproportionately affecting communities of color — all the way from space.A new study published in Environmental Science & Technology used satellite data to measure ammonia — a common pollutant produced by factory farms from the massive amounts of animal manure — in North Carolina. Across the eastern part of the state, University of Virginia researchers saw that ammonia levels were elevated in areas where there were high concentrations of industrialized pig facilities.

From 2016 to 2021, ammonia levels were 49 percent higher for Indigenous communities, 35 percent higher for Hispanic and Latino communities, and 27 percent higher for Black communities, compared to non-Hispanic white communities. Ammonia columns (figure a), permitted animal and swine facilities (figure b), and population by race/ethnicity (figure c). Environmental Science & Technology/Sally PusedeAmmonia has a distinctly unpleasant smell and can irritate the respiratory tract and skin. So for the people who live near these facilities, these findings likely won’t come as a surprise — they can smell and feel it. In the 2022 documentary The Smell of Money, which follows a community’s fight against a factory farm in North Carolina, residents talked about the revolting odor they’re forced to smell daily and their experiences of difficulty breathing, nausea, and chronic conditions like asthma. But as obvious as this information may be to residents affected by factory farms, having data to back up their claims of air pollution and other nuisances is important, said Sally Pusede, lead author of the study and an associate professor at the University of Virginia’s Department of Environmental Sciences. What makes this study unique, she argued, is that it’s taking measurements of an air quality impact and proving that it’s unequally distributed to communities of color in Eastern North Carolina.The study also highlighted a gap in tools and regulations: The researchers used space-based technology to consistently measure ammonia, which isn’t regularly monitored by state or federal agencies.“There are very few measurements of air pollution associated with industrialized agriculture from the ground,” Pusede told Vox. Even if residents are experiencing the health effects of exposure to ammonia, little can be done if there’s no data or a system in place to show they’re being exposed. “Without data to show that and support that, those claims can be contested.” How to measure ammonia from spaceThere are five criteria for air pollutants that the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) monitors, as mandated by the Clean Air Act: particulate matter, ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide.Enacted in 1963, the Clean Air Act aimed to mitigate the pollution from a growing amount of cars, power plants, and other industrial pollution sources. Notably, ammonia isn’t one of these regulated pollutants, nor are other agriculture-related pollutants like nitrogen oxide or hydrogen sulfide. RelatedThe Air Quality Index and how to use it, explainedIn a 2018 settlement, North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality agreed to conduct an air monitoring study in Duplin County after local environmental justice groups filed a 2014 federal civil rights complaint claiming pollution emitting from nearby swine facilities was disproportionately in nonwhite, low-income communities.As part of the settlement, the state environmental department’s Division of Air Quality (DAQ) measured pollutants including ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and PM2.5 (a deadly pollutant also known as fine particulate matter) over the course of a year. When the DAQ finished the study, it presented its findings: ammonia concentrations were not detectable aside from five occasions, and only one of those occasions approached North Carolina’s “acceptable ambient level.” So how could the state’s measurements find nearly no measurable concentrations of ammonia, despite residents’ longtime experience with strong odors and health conditions? Pusede says the results from her team’s study raise a lot of questions about how well the state’s study was done.“I think that there’s a conflict between an agency that has as its primary goal regulatory compliance, versus one that has as its primary goal protection,” said Pusede. She also noted that the instrument used by DAQ may not have been able to properly detect ammonia levels. For Pusede’s study, researchers measured ammonia levels with an Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), which resides on satellites in orbit. “It’s a space-based instrument that takes advantage of the fact that certain gasses interact with very specific wavelengths of light,” said Pusede. “You can take that interaction and use it to produce a column concentration of specific pollutants.”IASI collects data spatially every day. That allowed the researchers to map ammonia levels across entire regions of North Carolina and across an extended period of time. Alongside the IASI, the researchers used data from the US Census Bureau to access race and ethnicity data in North Carolina, weather condition data to calculate mean wind speeds and air temperature, and the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality’s database on permitted industrialized swine facilities.Researchers also found that weather conditions could exacerbate these inequalities. On hotter days, ammonia inequalities were higher by 31 percent for Black communities than for white communities. On days with calm winds, ammonia inequalities were higher by 64 percent in Indigenous communities — double the disparity from windy days.According to Pusede, ammonia can travel downwind, deposit onto the ground, and then as surfaces warm up, the pollutant can return back to the air in a process called ammonia bidirectional flux. This means that ammonia can degrade the air quality beyond the immediate vicinity of a swine facility, at an average of 5 kilometers (or a little over 3 miles) downwind of these facilities from April through August, the study says. But in all 50 states, “right to farm” laws have limited who can file complaints. In North Carolina, only people living a half-mile from the site of a claimed nuisance (such as awful odors) can take action.Heightened ammonia levels on hot days are also cause for concern when we’re facing a global warming crisis. More hot days means more opportunity for ammonia to spread and further intensify air pollution inequalities for Black, Hispanic, and Indigenous communities. But none of these results surprised Pusede. “What we found was consistent with what people were saying,” she said.“I think part of the question is, why do we have a black hole over eastern North Carolina in terms of ammonia?” said Chris Brown, director of research and education at North Carolina Environmental Justice Network. (This was one of the groups that filed the 2014 complaint). “It’s because our regulators have made it so that there can be this rapid expansion of an incredibly environmentally hazardous economic model,” they told Vox.The scope of this new UVA study helps show the scale of the issue, says Brown.The long-documented health consequence of factory farms Indeed, there’s a healthy amount of scientific evidence that shows the agricultural industry has adverse consequences on air quality in places like North Carolina, one of the nation’s top pork producers. One study found that there are 17,900 deaths annually because of reduced air quality from the industry’s activities — and that a large driver of these deaths came from ammonia emissions from animal waste and fertilizer application. RelatedHow Black North Carolinians pay the price for the world’s cheap bacon“It can affect the quality of your health while you’re alive,” said Jason Hill, lead author of this study and a professor at the University of Minnesota’s Department of Bioproducts and Biosystems Engineering. “But it also can increase your likelihood of dying early as a result of those acute conditions of heart attacks, strokes, cancer, and so forth.”Hill’s research found that there are a number of different inventions that could be taken to reduce air quality deaths from food producers: reducing food waste, lowering emissions from equipment, and improving fertilizer application processes, as well as manure management. Together, his team estimated that this could reduce premature deaths associated with food production by 50 percent.Pusede says the findings from her team’s research could be used by the state for future decision-making, including incorporating the research’s measurements into the Department of Environmental Quality’s community mapping tool, which gives the public a map of the spatial relationship between demographics like race, factory farms, permits, and health data.Brown says the UVA study shows the need for air quality permits. “There needs to be a standard in which each facility has to manage and monitor their own air emissions, to be able to have some accountability there,” they said.It’s not just air pollution that people are worried about, either. Waterways are prone to becoming contaminated with pollutants from factory farm waste, risking the public’s health and the integrity of another one of our key natural resources. North Carolina is also a particularly hurricane-prone state, and when these disasters hit, factory farms flood and “all of their feces, urine, waste goes everywhere,” said Brown.Despite research and lived experience showing the health impacts of the agricultural industry and a range of solutions to alleviate these harms, little has been done to change this on a policy level — even for something as seemingly straightforward as regulating and monitoring these pollutants. “There are very strong interests in not knowing what those emissions are, and not having them tied to specific facilities,” said Hill. Having that knowledge, via mandated measurements and monitoring of pollutants, would then hopefully force the agricultural industry to take some accountability. But with the industry as powerful as it is, it’s unlikely that they’ll be required to take steps to protect the public anytime soon.“Even when we gain a tool for accountability, the power structures of agriculture within our state legislature is so tight that any tools that we have get taken away,” said Brown.For now, studies like Pusede’s back up communities’ claims of harms on their health and livelihood from these facilities — and fuels their fight to clean air and water.You’ve read 1 article in the last monthHere at Vox, we're unwavering in our commitment to covering the issues that matter most to you — threats to democracy, immigration, reproductive rights, the environment, and the rising polarization across this country.Our mission is to provide clear, accessible journalism that empowers you to stay informed and engaged in shaping our world.

Across the eastern part of the state, University of Virginia researchers saw that ammonia levels were elevated in areas where there were high concentrations of industrialized pig facilities. </p>, <p class=\"mr4kuae\"><span class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup\">Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.</span></p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">In their research, they found significant population disparities. From 2016 to 2021, ammonia levels were 49 percent higher for Indigenous communities, 35 percent higher for Hispanic and Latino communities, and 27 percent higher for Black communities, compared to non-Hispanic white communities. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Ammonia has a distinctly unpleasant smell and can irritate the <a href=\"https://www.newrootsinstitute.org/articles/hidden-in-the-air-factory-farming-and-air-pollution\">respiratory tract and skin</a>. So for the people who <a href=\"/future-perfect/23003487/north-carolina-hog-pork-bacon-farms-environmental-racism-black-residents-pollution-meat-industry\">live near these facilities</a>, these findings likely won’t come as a surprise — they can smell and feel it. In the 2022 documentary <em>The Smell of Money</em>, which follows a community’s fight against a factory farm in North Carolina, residents <a href=\"/future-perfect/23003487/north-carolina-hog-pork-bacon-farms-environmental-racism-black-residents-pollution-meat-industry\">talked</a> about the revolting odor they’re forced to smell daily and their experiences of difficulty breathing, nausea, and chronic conditions like asthma. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">But as obvious as this information may be to residents affected by factory farms, having data to back up their claims of air pollution and other nuisances is important, said Sally Pusede, lead author of the study and an associate professor at the University of Virginia’s Department of Environmental Sciences. What makes this study unique, she argued, is that it’s taking measurements of an air quality impact and proving that it’s unequally distributed to communities of color in Eastern North Carolina.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">The study also highlighted a gap in tools and regulations: The researchers used space-based technology to consistently measure ammonia, which isn’t regularly monitored by state or federal agencies.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">“There are very few measurements of air pollution associated with industrialized agriculture from the ground,” Pusede told Vox. Even if residents are experiencing the health effects of exposure to ammonia, little can be done if there’s no data or a system in place to show they’re being exposed. “Without data to show that and support that, those claims can be contested.” </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">There are five criteria for air pollutants that the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) monitors, as mandated by the Clean Air Act: particulate matter, ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Enacted in 1963, <a href=\"/future-perfect/23757949/air-pollution-history-progress-clean-air-act-environmental-protection-agency-wildfires-smoke-smog\">the Clean Air Act</a> aimed to mitigate the pollution from a growing amount of cars, power plants, and other industrial pollution sources. Notably, ammonia isn’t one of these regulated pollutants, nor are other agriculture-related pollutants like nitrogen oxide or hydrogen sulfide. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">In a 2018 <a href=\"https://ncnewsline.com/briefs/environmental-justice-groups-reach-settlement-with-deq-over-federal-complaint-hog-farms/\">settlement</a>, North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality agreed to conduct an air monitoring study in Duplin County after local environmental justice groups filed a 2014 federal civil rights complaint claiming pollution emitting from nearby swine facilities was disproportionately in nonwhite, low-income communities.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">As part of the settlement, the state environmental department’s Division of Air Quality (DAQ) measured pollutants including ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and <a href=\"/future-perfect/22691558/air-pollution-deaths-mortality-pm-25-soot-particulate\">PM2.5</a> (a deadly pollutant also known as fine particulate matter) over the course of a year. When the DAQ finished the study, it presented its findings: ammonia concentrations were not detectable aside from five occasions, and only one of those occasions approached North Carolina’s “acceptable ambient level.” </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">So how could the state’s measurements find nearly no measurable concentrations of ammonia, despite residents’ longtime experience with strong odors and health conditions? Pusede says the results from her team’s study raise a lot of questions about how well the state’s study was done.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">“I think that there’s a conflict between an agency that has as its primary goal regulatory compliance, versus one that has as its primary goal protection,” said Pusede. She also noted that the instrument used by DAQ may not have been able to properly detect ammonia levels. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">For Pusede’s study, researchers measured ammonia levels with an Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), which resides on satellites in orbit. “It’s a space-based instrument that takes advantage of the fact that certain gasses interact with very specific wavelengths of light,” said Pusede. “You can take that interaction and use it to produce a column concentration of specific pollutants.”</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">IASI collects data spatially every day. That allowed the researchers to map ammonia levels across entire regions of North Carolina and across an extended period of time. Alongside the IASI, the researchers used data from the US Census Bureau to access race and ethnicity data in North Carolina, weather condition data to calculate mean wind speeds and air temperature, and the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality’s database on permitted industrialized swine facilities.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Researchers also found that weather conditions could exacerbate these inequalities. On hotter days, ammonia inequalities were higher by 31 percent for Black communities than for white communities. On days with calm winds, ammonia inequalities were higher by 64 percent in Indigenous communities — double the disparity from windy days.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">According to Pusede, ammonia can travel downwind, deposit onto the ground, and then as surfaces warm up, the pollutant can return back to the air in a process called ammonia bidirectional flux. This means that ammonia can degrade the air quality beyond the immediate vicinity of a swine facility, at an average of 5 kilometers (or a little over 3 miles) downwind of these facilities from April through August, the study says. But in all 50 states, “<a href=\"https://nationalaglawcenter.org/state-compilations/right-to-farm/\">right to farm</a>” laws have limited who can file complaints. <a href=\"https://www.law.georgetown.edu/environmental-law-review/in-print/volume-34-issue-1/taking-the-whole-hog-how-north-carolinas-right-to-farm-act-strips-access-to-nuisance-suits-for-vulnerable-communities/\">In North Carolina</a>, only people living a half-mile from the site of a claimed nuisance (such as awful odors) can take action.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Heightened ammonia levels on hot days are also cause for concern when we’re facing a global warming crisis. More hot days means more opportunity for ammonia to spread and further intensify air pollution inequalities for Black, Hispanic, and Indigenous communities. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">But none of these results surprised Pusede. “What we found was consistent with what people were saying,” she said.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">“I think part of the question is, why do we have a black hole over eastern North Carolina in terms of ammonia?” said Chris Brown, director of research and education at North Carolina Environmental Justice Network. (This was one of the groups that filed the 2014 complaint). “It’s because our regulators have made it so that there can be this rapid expansion of an incredibly environmentally hazardous economic model,” they told Vox.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">The scope of this new UVA study helps show the scale of the issue, says Brown.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Indeed, there’s a healthy amount of scientific evidence that shows the agricultural industry has <a href=\"https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1205109\">adverse</a> <a href=\"https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.11250\">consequences</a> on air quality in places like North Carolina, <a href=\"https://minnesotareformer.com/2024/02/28/graphic-in-most-major-pork-states-large-hog-farms-have-gotten-larger/\">one of the nation’s top pork producers</a>. One <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2013637118#executive-summary-abstract\">study</a> found that there are 17,900 deaths annually because of reduced air quality from the industry’s activities — and that a large driver of these deaths came from ammonia emissions from animal waste and fertilizer application. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">“It can affect the quality of your health while you’re alive,” said Jason Hill, lead author of this study and a professor at the University of Minnesota’s Department of Bioproducts and Biosystems Engineering. “But it also can increase your likelihood of dying early as a result of those acute conditions of heart attacks, strokes, cancer, and so forth.”</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Hill’s research found that there are a number of different inventions that could be taken to reduce air quality deaths from food producers: reducing food waste, lowering emissions from equipment, and improving fertilizer application processes, as well as manure management. Together, his team estimated that this could reduce premature deaths associated with food production by 50 percent.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Pusede says the findings from her team’s research could be used by the state for future decision-making, including incorporating the research’s measurements into the Department of Environmental Quality’s <a href=\"https://ncdenr.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=1eb0fbe2bcfb4cccb3cc212af8a0b8c8\">community mapping tool</a>, which gives the public a map of the spatial relationship between demographics like race, factory farms, permits, and health data.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Brown says the UVA study shows the need for air quality permits. “There needs to be a standard in which each facility has to manage and monitor their own air emissions, to be able to have some accountability there,” they said.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">It’s not just air pollution that people are worried about, either. Waterways are prone to becoming <a href=\"https://civileats.com/2021/09/13/epa-to-revise-outdated-water-pollution-standards-for-slaughterhouses/\">contaminated</a> with pollutants from factory farm waste, risking the public’s health and the integrity of another one of our key natural resources. North Carolina is also a particularly hurricane-prone state, and when these disasters hit, <a href=\"/energy-and-environment/2018/9/18/17873632/hurricane-florence-flooding-hog-lagoon-waste-coal-ash-north-carolina\">factory farms flood</a> and “all of their feces, urine, waste goes everywhere,” said Brown.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Despite research and lived experience showing the health impacts of the agricultural industry and a range of solutions to alleviate these harms, little has been done to change this on a policy level — even for something as seemingly straightforward as regulating and monitoring these pollutants. “There are very strong interests in not knowing what those emissions are, and not having them tied to specific facilities,” said Hill. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Having that knowledge, via mandated measurements and monitoring of pollutants, would then hopefully force the agricultural industry to take some accountability. But with the industry as powerful as it is, it’s unlikely that they’ll be required to take steps to protect the public anytime soon.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">“Even when we gain a tool for accountability, the power structures of agriculture within our state legislature is so tight that any tools that we have get taken away,” said Brown.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">For now, studies like Pusede’s back up communities’ claims of harms on their health and livelihood from these facilities — and fuels their fight to clean air and water.</p>, <p class=\"_1tzd3in1\">You’ve read <!-- -->1<!-- --> article<!-- --> in the last month</p>, <p class=\"_1tzd3in4\">Here at Vox, we're unwavering in our commitment to covering the issues that matter most to you — threats to democracy, immigration, reproductive rights, the environment, and the rising polarization across this country.</p>, <p class=\"_1tzd3in4\">Our mission is to provide clear, accessible journalism that empowers you to stay informed and engaged in shaping our world.

      "Dans l’histoire des catastrophes environnementales, le Great Smog de Londres est certainement l’un des épisodes de pollution les plus meurtriers de l’histoire. La capitale britannique était alors un centre industriel majeur, avec de nombreuses usines et centrales thermiques au charbon qui émettaient d’importantes quantités de particules fines, de dioxyde de soufre et d’autres polluants. La majorité de ses habitants se chauffaient aussi au charbon ; de très mauvaise qualité ; pour contrer les températures rigoureuses de l’hiver anglais.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ce combustible, combiné à une densité de population élevée et à une activité industrielle intense, a libéré d’importantes quantités de polluants dans l’atmosphère, transformant l’air en un véritable poison. Entre le jeudi 4 au mardi 9 décembre 1952, l’impensable s’est produit : 12 000 personnes ont perdu la vie et 100 000 sont tombés gravement malades. Le Great Smog fut un événement presque cataclysmique, qui a constitué un cas d’école exceptionnel pour la compréhension des phénomènes de pollution atmosphérique urbaine. \n",

      "Inversion thermique : la bombe à retardement qui a asphyxié Londres Pour comprendre l’épisode du Great Smog, il faut d’abord analyser les conditions météorologiques que connaissait Londres à cette période. Le 4 décembre 1952, un anticyclone particulièrement stable s’installe au-dessus de la capitale britannique. Ce système météorologique a engendré une inversion thermique caractérisée : une couche d’air chaud en altitude, agissant comme un couvercle thermique, a emprisonné une masse d’air froid au niveau du sol. Les températures chutèrent brutalement, atteignant -2 °C en surface. Les études thermodynamiques menées par le Meteorological Office britannique ont mis en évidence un gradient de température inverse jusqu’à 500 mètres d’altitude : l’air se réchauffe de 2° C tous les 100 mètres, contrairement au gradient habituel de -1 °C/100.  Cette configuration atmosphérique inhabituelle a bloqué toute dispersion verticale des polluants, créant une véritable chambre de réaction chimique à l’échelle urbaine. Ces derniers sont ainsi restés piégés au niveau du sol, augmentant considérablement leur concentration. Un air saturé par des polluants mortels S’en est suivi une cascade de réactions chimiques ; le dioxyde de soufre (SO2), émis massivement par la combustion du charbon domestique et industriel, a subi une série de transformations. En raison de la présence d’un fort taux d’humidité atmosphérique et de catalyseurs métalliques (principalement du fer et du manganèse issus des émissions industrielles), le SO2 s’est oxydé en trioxyde de soufre (SO3).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Les concentrations en SO2 ont rapidement des niveaux stupéfiants : 3,4 ppm en moyenne, avec des pics localisés à 4,2 ppm dans certains quartiers industriels. Pour référence, la norme actuelle de l’OMS fixe le seuil d’alerte à 0,5 ppm sur une heure. Les analyses des archives médicales ont révélé une corrélation parfaite entre ces concentrations et la distribution spatiale de la mortalité. Le  SO3 a réagi instantanément avec l’eau présente dans l’atmosphère pour former de l’acide sulfurique (H2SO4). Cet acide sulfurique, extrêmement corrosif, a été l’une des principales causes des dommages aux poumons et aux voies respiratoires des Londoniens. Il s’est mêlé aux particules en suspension dans l’air, formant des aérosols acides. La formation d’aérosols secondaires a amplifié le phénomène. Les particules de suie, dont le diamètre varie entre 0,1 et 10 µm (micromètres), ont servi de noyaux de condensation. Elles ont catalysé la formation de gouttelettes d’acide sulfurique en suspension, créant un brouillard corrosif d’une densité à peine croyable. Dans les zones les plus touchées, on ne voyait pas à plus de 30 cm devant soi.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Résultat : les Londoniens ont donc respiré un mélange extrêmement toxique d’air et cette inhalation prolongée de substances irritantes et corrosives a entraîné de graves effets sur leurs organismes. Toux, difficultés respiratoires, sensation d’oppression thoracique, bronchites, et dans les cas les plus graves, des œdèmes pulmonaires.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Les yeux, la gorge et les voies nasales ont été particulièrement affectés par l’acidité de l’air, provoquant des conjonctivites, des rhinites et des pharyngites. Les particules fines ont pénétré profondément dans les poumons et sont dans la circulation sanguine, augmentant ainsi le risque d’infarctus du myocarde et d’accidents vasculaires cérébraux. Une véritable hécatombe. La catastrophe a contraint le monde politique à agir. Les scientifiques, dont les voix étaient jusqu’alors peu écoutées, ont finalement été entendus. Sous la pression de l’opinion publique, le Parlement a adopté en 1956 le Clean Air Act, marquant un tournant dans la politique énergétique du pays. L’introduction de zones sans fumée, le contrôle strict des émissions industrielles et la modernisation des systèmes de chauffage ont entraîné une réduction spectaculaire des émissions de particules : – 76 % en une décennie, passant de 250 μg/m³ en moyenne annuelle à 60 μg/m³.\n",

      "\n",

      "Le Great Smog a marqué l’histoire britannique d’une empreinte indélébile, mais malheureusement, la pollution de l’air est toujours un phénomène d’actualité. De nombreux pays restent encore aujourd’hui sous la menace d’épisodes aussi dangereux. La Chine, l’Inde et les pays du Sud-Est asiatique sont particulièrement concernés et des mégapoles comme Delhi, Pékin ou Jakarta sont régulièrement en proie à des épisodes de pollution extrême. Selon l’UNICEF : « La pollution atmosphérique a un impact de plus en plus important sur la santé humaine, constituant le deuxième facteur de risque de décès dans le monde […] et a été à l’origine de 8,1 millions de décès dans le monde en 2021 ». Bien que des progrès aient été réalisés, nous sommes donc très loin de prétendre respirer un air sain et même la France est concernée, avec « 40 000 décès attribuables chaque année aux particules fines » selon Santé Publique France.  Le Great Smog de Londres en 1952 a été causé par une combinaison d’inversion thermique, de pollution industrielle et de l’usage intensif de charbon, créant un brouillard extrêmement toxique. Ce brouillard a entraîné des milliers de morts et des maladies respiratoires graves, en raison des particules fines et des composés acides. Cet événement a conduit à des réformes majeures sur la qualité de l’air au Royaume-Uni, bien que la pollution reste un problème critique à l’échelle mondiale de nos jours.   📍 Pour ne manquer aucune actualité de Presse-citron, suivez-nous sur Google Actualités et WhatsApp.   Newsletter 🍋 Abonnez-vous, et recevez chaque matin un résumé de l’actu tech  Votre email :   Je m'inscris            \tJ'ai lu et accepte        \t          \tles termes et les conditions        \t    Laissez ce champ vide si vous êtes humain :  \n",

      "[<p>Cinq jours d’un cocktail mortel dans l’air londonien : charbon, pollution et négligence.</p>, <p>Dans l’histoire des catastrophes environnementales, le <em>Great Smog</em> de Londres est certainement <strong>l’un des épisodes de pollution les plus meurtriers de l’histoire</strong>. La capitale britannique était alors un centre industriel majeur, avec de nombreuses usines et centrales thermiques au charbon qui émettaient d’importantes quantités de particules fines, de dioxyde de soufre et d’autres polluants. La majorité de ses habitants se chauffaient aussi au charbon ; de très mauvaise qualité ; pour contrer les températures rigoureuses de l’hiver anglais.</p>, <p>Ce combustible, combiné à une densité de population élevée et à une activité industrielle intense, a libéré d’importantes quantités de polluants dans l’atmosphère, transformant l’air en un véritable poison. Entre le jeudi 4 au mardi 9 décembre 1952, l’impensable s’est produit : <strong>12 000 personnes ont perdu la vie et 100 000 sont tombés gravement malades</strong>. Le <em>Great Smog</em> fut un événement presque cataclysmique, qui a constitué un cas d’école exceptionnel pour la compréhension des phénomènes de <a href=\"https://www.presse-citron.net/quest-ce-que-le-hfc-125-cette-substance-dans-lair-en-forte-augmentation-reperee-par-les-satellites/\">pollution atmosphérique</a> urbaine.</p>, <p>Pour comprendre l’épisode du <em>Great Smog</em>, il faut d’abord analyser les conditions météorologiques que connaissait Londres à cette période. Le 4 décembre 1952, <strong>un anticyclone particulièrement stable</strong> s’installe au-dessus de la capitale britannique. Ce système météorologique a engendré une inversion thermique caractérisée : une couche d’air chaud en altitude, agissant comme un couvercle thermique, a emprisonné une masse d’air froid au niveau du sol. Les températures chutèrent brutalement, atteignant -2 °C en surface.</p>, <p>Les études thermodynamiques menées par le Meteorological Office britannique ont mis en évidence un gradient de température inverse jusqu’à 500 mètres d’altitude : l’air se réchauffe de 2° C tous les 100 mètres, contrairement au gradient habituel de -1 °C/100.  Cette configuration atmosphérique inhabituelle <strong>a bloqué toute dispersion verticale des polluants</strong>, créant une véritable chambre de réaction chimique à l’échelle urbaine. Ces derniers sont ainsi restés piégés au niveau du sol, augmentant considérablement leur concentration.</p>, <p>S’en est suivi <strong>une cascade de réactions chimiques</strong> ; le dioxyde de soufre (SO<sub>2</sub>), émis massivement par la combustion du charbon domestique et industriel, a subi une série de transformations. En raison de la présence d’un fort taux d’humidité atmosphérique et de catalyseurs métalliques (principalement du fer et du manganèse issus des émissions industrielles), le SO<sub>2</sub> s’est oxydé en trioxyde de soufre (SO<sub>3</sub>).</p>, <p>Les concentrations en SO<sub>2</sub> <strong>ont rapidement des niveaux stupéfiants</strong> : 3,4 ppm en moyenne, avec des pics localisés à 4,2 ppm dans certains quartiers industriels. Pour référence, la norme actuelle de l’OMS fixe le seuil d’alerte à 0,5 ppm sur une heure. Les analyses des archives médicales ont révélé une corrélation parfaite entre ces concentrations et la distribution spatiale de la mortalité.</p>, <p>Le  SO<sub>3 </sub>a réagi instantanément avec l’eau présente dans l’atmosphère pour former de l’acide sulfurique (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>). Cet acide sulfurique, extrêmement corrosif, a été <strong>l’une des principales causes des dommages</strong> aux poumons et aux voies respiratoires des Londoniens. Il s’est mêlé aux particules en suspension dans l’air, formant des aérosols acides.</p>, <p>La formation d’aérosols secondaires a amplifié le phénomène. Les particules de suie, dont le diamètre varie entre 0,1 et 10 µm (micromètres), ont servi de noyaux de condensation. Elles ont catalysé la formation de gouttelettes d’acide sulfurique en suspension, créant un brouillard corrosif d’une densité à peine croyable. Dans les zones les plus touchées, <strong>on ne voyait pas à plus de 30 cm devant soi</strong>.</p>, <p>Résultat : les Londoniens ont donc respiré un mélange extrêmement toxique d’air et cette inhalation prolongée de substances irritantes et corrosives<strong> a entraîné de graves effets sur leurs organismes</strong>. Toux, difficultés respiratoires, sensation d’oppression thoracique, bronchites, et dans les cas les plus graves, des œdèmes pulmonaires.</p>, <p>Les yeux, la gorge et les voies nasales ont été particulièrement affectés par l’acidité de l’air, provoquant des conjonctivites, des rhinites et des pharyngites. Les particules fines ont pénétré profondément dans les poumons et sont dans la circulation sanguine, augmentant ainsi le risque d’infarctus du myocarde et <a href=\"https://www.presse-citron.net/cette-ia-peut-prevenir-de-maniere-fiable-les-avc-et-les-crises-cardiaques/\">d’accidents vasculaires cérébraux</a>. <strong>Une véritable hécatombe</strong>.</p>, <p>La catastrophe a contraint le monde politique à agir. Les scientifiques, dont les voix étaient jusqu’alors peu écoutées, <strong>ont finalement été entendus</strong>. Sous la pression de l’opinion publique, le Parlement a adopté en 1956 le<em> Clean Air Act</em>, marquant un tournant dans la politique énergétique du pays. L’introduction de zones sans fumée, le contrôle strict des émissions industrielles et la modernisation des systèmes de chauffage ont entraîné une réduction spectaculaire des émissions de particules : – 76 % en une décennie, passant de 250 μg/m³ en moyenne annuelle à 60 μg/m³.</p>, <p>Le <em>Great Smog</em> a marqué l’histoire britannique d’une empreinte indélébile, mais malheureusement,<strong> la pollution de l’air est toujours un phénomène d’actualité</strong>. De nombreux pays restent encore aujourd’hui sous la menace d’épisodes aussi dangereux. La Chine, l’Inde et les pays du Sud-Est asiatique sont particulièrement concernés et des mégapoles comme Delhi, Pékin ou Jakarta sont régulièrement en proie<strong> à des épisodes de pollution extrême</strong>. <a href=\"https://www.unicef.fr/article/la-pollution-de-lair-a-lorigine-de-81-millions-de-deces-en-2021/\" rel=\"false noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Selon l’UNICEF</a> : « <em>La pollution atmosphérique a un impact de plus en plus important sur la santé humaine, constituant le deuxième facteur de risque de décès dans le monde […] et a été à l’origine de 8,1 millions de décès dans le monde en 2021</em> ». Bien que des progrès aient été réalisés, nous sommes donc très loin de <strong>prétendre respirer un air sain</strong> et même la France est concernée, avec « <em>40 000 décès attribuables chaque année aux particules fines</em> » selon <a href=\"https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/presse/2021/pollution-de-l-air-ambiant-nouvelles-estimations-de-son-impact-sur-la-sante-des-francais#:~:text=Elle%20conclut%20que%20la%20mortalit%C3%A9,(PM2%2C5).\" rel=\"false noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Santé Publique France</a>.</p>, <p class=\"text-base text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300\">📍 Pour ne manquer aucune actualité de Presse-citron, suivez-nous sur <a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBggKMIPiNTC70wU?hl=fr&amp;gl=FR&amp;ceid=FR%3Afr\" target=\"_blank\">Google Actualités</a> et <a href=\"https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaCkGuz4NViitBXbEr0b\" target=\"_blank\">WhatsApp</a>.</p>, <p class=\"text-2xl text-black dark:text-white font-extrabold\">Newsletter 🍋</p>, <p class=\"my-1 text-lg text-neutral-400 font-light\">Abonnez-vous, et recevez chaque matin un résumé de l’actu tech</p>, <p class=\"mt-3 text-sm\"> <label> <input name=\"AGREE_TO_TERMS\" required=\"\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"1\"/>        \tJ'ai lu et accepte        \t<a class=\"link-reset text-net\" href=\"/comment-sabonner-la-newsletter-presse-citron/\" target=\"_blank\">          \tles termes et les conditions        \t</a> </label> </p>, <p class=\"float-right\">\n",

Listen to more stories on the Noa app.When my family returned to our home in Santa Monica last Sunday night, we breathed a sigh of relief. Our house was fine, and the air quality was in the “good” category. Schools would reopen the next day. But as we unpacked, I noticed what looked like salt-and-pepper snow delicately dancing over the street. Ash from the Palisades Fire, burning just five miles north of us, was descending all around, coating the car we had left behind. In the backyard, it gathered over the small patch of turf we played on and in small clusters all across the garden, where my kids had recently planted carrots.The next morning, we walked to school, talking about the blue sky. My 8-year-old pointed out the piles of windblown ash by the curb. That day, the kids would stay inside so the school could clean the debris from the playground equipment and yard.As I walked the four blocks back home, a city-owned street sweeper buzzed past. When the truck’s bristles hit the pockets of ash, they kicked up car-size clouds of dust, sending all the debris back into the air. I clutched my N95 mask tighter against my face, pulled down my sunglasses, and jogged away. I closed the door tightly behind me.That night, a local bookstore and mediation space held a ceremony to “call in the rain for a land devastated by fire.” Rain would help keep more fires from starting, and it would also help wash the ash away. For now, we’re left to deal with it on our own, swabbing surfaces, clearing streets, wondering what we’re breathing in and what it will do to the waterways that absorb it.On Tuesday, the debris was continuing to fall, so the school held a “walking-only” recess. When I saw gardeners arriving armed with leaf blowers, my heart sank. (Los Angeles County has temporarily banned their use because they throw up so much dust.) But no one knew exactly the right way to clean up the mess. One neighbor was vacuuming their steps with a Shop-Vac.With smoke, the hazards are clear: You can see it and smell it, and get out of the way. Our phones have been vibrating with air-quality indexes, which measure pollution in the air, but not ash. With ash circling like toxic feathers, it’s hard to know what is safe. The residue from house fires contains far more toxins than that of brush fires. The PVC pipes, lithium-ion car batteries, plastic siding, flooring, and everything else that vaporized in the blazes launched a soup of chemicals—nickel, chromium, arsenic, mercury—into the air. Older homes can contain lead and asbestos. Until Wednesday, the day after walking-only recess, L.A. County had an ash advisory in place, which recommended staying inside and wearing a mask and goggles when leaving the house.But our lives in Los Angeles are largely outside: This is a city that dines outdoors all year long, where winter temperatures hover in the 60s and surfers are in the water in January. With no rain in the forecast, how long will our lives be coated in a fine layer of toxic dust? Maybe a very long time: A webinar put on by California Communities Against Toxics warned that the amount of ash that the fires had generated would take years to excavate, and created public-health risks.The prospect of continued exposure to airborne chemicals sounds ominous, but Thomas Borch, a professor of environmental and agricultural chemistry at Colorado State University, was more sanguine. After the 2021 Marshall Fire tore through towns in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, Borch studied contaminants in the soil at houses near the fire. Some of the properties had elevated levels of heavy metals, but most were still below levels of concern. And although living among clouds of fine debris might feel apocalyptic, Borch told me that the wind could be helping to dilute the contamination in my neighborhood. “A lot of these ashes spread out over a much bigger area,” he said, which helps mitigate their health impacts.Once ash and soot creep inside homes—through doors and windows, on shoes and clothes—“it’s a lot harder to actually get rid of,” he added. Cleaning can reinvigorate pollution inside the home, so it has to be done carefully. Borch advised that we vacuum with a HEPA filter and wet-mop surfaces to keep pollution from building up inside the house.But the real questions regarding human health and ash are still open. Researchers have only recently started to investigate how the ash from structural fires differs from that of wildfires. In Los Angeles, Borch’s colleagues have set up 10 coffee-bag-size samplers around the fires (as close as they were allowed to go). They also plan to collect ash from within the burn areas and from windblown dust to compare the different toxins in smoke and ash, as well as their concentrations in the weeks and months following the fires.If rain does arrive, it will wash out much of the debris, and the city will feel clear again. But that rain could also carry contaminants into streams, reservoirs used for drinking water, or the Pacific Ocean. Perhaps by then the wind will have blown most of the ash away, or in places, such as my neighborhood, outside of the fire’s direct path—we will have cleared the ash on our own. (Clearing ash in fire zones is a regulated process.) My family is still waiting to pull up the vegetables in our yard, but I’m no longer worried about bouncing balls and biking. We’ve been slowly wetting down our stone patio and stairs and trying to gently sweep up the ash, while making sure we’re protected by gloves, goggles, and masks. Half of the neighbors are wearing masks outside. We’re still swirling around like ash from the crisis, waiting for the rains to put everything back in place.About the AuthorKatharine GammonKatharine Gammon is a freelance science writer based in Santa Monica, California.More StoriesStingrays Are a Bigger Threat Than SharksElephants Might Have a Big Carbon FootprintExplore More TopicsCalifornia, Los Angeles, Los Angeles County\n",

After the 2021 Marshall Fire tore through towns in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, Borch studied <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.3c08508?ref=pdf\">contaminants in the soil</a> at houses near the fire. Some of the properties had elevated levels of heavy metals, but most were still below levels of concern. And although living among clouds of fine debris might feel apocalyptic, Borch told me that the wind could be helping to dilute the contamination in my neighborhood. “A lot of these ashes spread out over a much bigger area,” he said, which helps mitigate their health impacts.</p>, <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"></p>, <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Once ash and soot creep inside homes—through doors and windows, on shoes and clothes—“it’s a lot harder to actually get rid of,” he added. Cleaning can reinvigorate pollution inside the home, so it has to be done carefully. Borch advised that we vacuum with a HEPA filter and wet-mop surfaces to keep pollution from building up inside the house.</p>, <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"></p>, <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">But the real questions regarding human health and ash are still open. Researchers have only recently started to investigate how the ash from structural fires differs from that of wildfires. In Los Angeles, Borch’s colleagues have set up 10 coffee-bag-size samplers around the fires (as close as they were allowed to go). They also plan to collect ash from within the burn areas and from windblown dust to compare the different toxins in smoke and ash, as well as their concentrations in the weeks and months following the fires.</p>, <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"></p>, <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">If rain does arrive, it will wash out much of the debris, and the city will feel clear again. But that rain could also carry contaminants into streams, reservoirs used for drinking water, or the Pacific Ocean. Perhaps by then the wind will have blown most of the ash away, or in places, such as my neighborhood, outside of the fire’s direct path—we will have cleared the ash on our own. (Clearing ash in fire zones is a <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubdetail.cfm?unit=media&amp;ou=ph&amp;prog=media&amp;cur=cur&amp;prid=4943&amp;row=25&amp;start=1\">regulated process</a>.) My family is still waiting to pull up the vegetables in our yard, but I’m no longer worried about bouncing balls and biking. We’ve been slowly wetting down our stone patio and stairs and trying to gently sweep up the ash, while making sure we’re protected by gloves, goggles, and masks. Half of the neighbors are wearing masks outside. We’re still swirling around like ash from the crisis, waiting for the rains to put everything back in place.</p>, <p class=\"ArticleBio_contentHeading__cmbmT\">More Stories</p>, <p>Stingrays Are a Bigger Threat Than Sharks</p>, <p>Elephants Might Have a Big Carbon Footprint</p>]\n",

      "A new report out Thursday from the American Cancer Society showed that the number of women under 65 diagnosed with cancer has been steadily increasing.The report, which tracked cancer incidence nationwide from 1991 to 2022, found that cancer rates in women under 50 are now 82% higher than for men the same age, signaling a dramatic, steady climb over the past two decades.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest cancer risk for working-age women is still breast cancer, but researchers were alarmed to see female lung cancer cases are also ticking up and have crossed a threshold.\"For the first time, if you're a woman under the age of 65, you have a greater chance of developing lung cancer than a man,\" Dr. William Dahut, the American Cancer Society's chief scientific officer, said in a briefing with reporters.\"This is, I think, really a transformational change,\" he said.\n",

      "The trend, building for years, reached a tipping point in 2021.Dahut said that could be due in part to uneven smoking patterns between men and women in the 1960s. Women smoked \"heavily later on, more likely in the mid- to late-'60s, while men peaked earlier,\" he said.Still, around 20% of lung cancer diagnoses in women are not linked to smoking and are more likely due to environmental factors like radon and asbestos exposure, air pollution, or heavy drinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Racial gapThe report emphasized that while there was major progress in cancer treatment over the 30-year study period, with roughly 4.5 million cancer deaths avoided nationwide from 1991 to 2022, there are still striking racial disparities in cancer detection, treatment, and survivability.\n",

Death rates for Black people with prostate, stomach, and uterine cancer are twice as high as for white Americans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cancer cases rising in young peopleThe report does contain some good news: Overall cancer deaths across the US tumbled 34% in the 30-year period from 1991 to 2022.Increasingly, though, young adults are now facing a higher risk of cancer. Colorectal cancer rates are up for people under 65; cervical cancer is on the rise in women between 30 and 44 years old; and teens between 15 and 19 are more likely to develop adolescent cancers.\"Continued reductions in cancer mortality because of drops in smoking, better treatment, and earlier detection is certainly great news,\" Rebecca Siegel, an ACS epidemiologist and the lead author of the new report, said in a release.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"However, this progress is tempered by rising incidence in young and middle-aged women, who are often the family caregivers, and a shifting cancer burden from men to women, harkening back to the early 1900s when cancer was more common in women,\" she said.\n",

      "[<p>Working-age women in the US are now more likely to get <a class=\"\" data-analytics-product-module=\"body_link\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/category/cancer\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\">cancer</a> than men of the same age.</p>, <p>A new report out Thursday from the American Cancer Society showed that the number of women under 65 diagnosed with cancer has been steadily increasing.</p>, <p>The report, which tracked cancer incidence nationwide from 1991 to 2022, found that <a class=\"\" data-analytics-product-module=\"body_link\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/more-young-women-getting-breast-cancer-two-potential-reasons-2024-10\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\">cancer rates in women</a> under 50 are now 82% higher than for men the same age, signaling a dramatic, steady climb over the past two decades.</p>, <p>The biggest <a class=\"\" data-analytics-product-module=\"body_link\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/being-a-mom-with-cancer-is-hard-2024-12\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\">cancer risk for working-age women</a> is still breast cancer, but researchers were alarmed to see female lung cancer cases are also ticking up and have crossed a threshold.</p>, <p>\"For the first time, if you're a woman under the age of 65, you have a greater chance of developing lung cancer than a man,\"<strong> </strong>Dr. William Dahut, the American Cancer Society's chief scientific officer, said in a briefing with reporters.</p>, <p>\"This is, I think, really a transformational change,\" he said.</p>, <p>The trend, building for years, reached a tipping point in 2021.</p>, <p>Dahut said that could be due in part to uneven smoking patterns between men and women in the 1960s. Women smoked \"heavily later on, more likely in the mid- to late-'60s, while men peaked earlier,\" he said.</p>, <p>Still, around 20% of lung cancer diagnoses in women are not linked to smoking and are more likely due to environmental factors like radon and asbestos exposure, air pollution, or heavy drinking.</p>, <p>The report emphasized that while there was major progress in cancer treatment over the 30-year study period, with roughly 4.5 million cancer deaths avoided nationwide from 1991 to 2022, there are still striking racial disparities in cancer detection, treatment, and survivability.</p>, <p>Though white women are more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer, Black women are more likely to die from it, suggesting that both cancer screening and cancer treatment for people of color are subpar.</p>, <p>Native Americans have disproportionately high rates of kidney, liver, stomach, and cervical cancers. Death rates for Black people with prostate, stomach, and uterine cancer are twice as high as for white Americans.</p>, <p>The report does contain some good news: Overall cancer deaths across the US tumbled 34% in the 30-year period from 1991 to 2022.</p>, <p>Increasingly, though, young adults are now facing a higher risk of cancer. Colorectal cancer rates are up for people under 65; cervical cancer is on the rise in women between 30 and 44 years old; and teens between 15 and 19 are more likely to develop adolescent cancers.</p>, <p>\"Continued reductions in cancer mortality because of drops in smoking, better treatment, and earlier detection is certainly great news,\" <a data-analytics-product-module=\"body_link\" href=\"https://www.cancer.org/research/acs-researchers/rebecca-siegel-bio.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Rebecca Siegel</a>, an ACS epidemiologist and the lead author of the new report, said in a release.</p>, <p>\"However, this progress is tempered by rising incidence in young and middle-aged women, who are often the family caregivers, and a shifting cancer burden from men to women, harkening back to the early 1900s when cancer was more common in women,\" she said.</p>, <p>Jump to</p>]\n",

      "A new watchdog report says Navy SEAL candidates face health risks from contaminated water during training in California.It says Naval Special Warfare Command has ignored local bacteria-related beach closure advisories.Nearly 1,200 gastrointestinal illness cases were reported among trainees from 2019 to 2023.Navy SEAL candidates have been swimming in waters off Southern California with high levels of fecal matter, according to a new Pentagon watchdog report.\n",
      "\n",
      "And they've been doing it while beaches are closed to the public to prevent exposure to the hazard, the report said. Naval Special Warfare Command did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment.A Department of Defense Inspector General report released last week said that \"Navy SEAL candidate exposure to contaminated water occurred because [Naval Special Warfare Command] did not follow San Diego County's Beach and Bay Water Quality Program's beach closure postings.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As a result of Navy SEAL candidate exposure to contaminated water during training, candidates are presented with increased health risks,\" the report said.Between January 2019 and May 2023, the Navy diagnosed almost 1,200 cases of acute gastrointestinal illnesses amongst SEAL and Special Warfare Combat Crewman candidates training at Coronado. AGI can include a range of symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.Nearly 40% of those cases were diagnosed within a week of exposure to ocean water that exceeded state limits, the report said.\n",

      "Investigators found dangerous levels of enterococcus on beaches on both ends of Coronado in around 75% of water samples collected last year.Naval Special Warfare relies on local water quality reports provided by San Diego County to identify bacterial presence in waters during training, the report says. It does not conduct self-testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the county water test results indicate dangerously high levels of fecal presence, local beaches are shut down until further testing indicates safer levels of bacteria. But most of the time, when the local beaches are closed, SEAL training doesn't stop.Sources of fecal bacteria can include wastewater treatment plant runoff, leaking septic systems, and discharged sewage.California lawmakers have previously highlighted problems with San Diego's South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant to Congress, according to The Coronado News, which investigated how millions of gallons of sewage flows from nearby Mexico into the Pacific Ocean.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Unhealthy levels of pollution are present not only in the ocean, but sewage that washes up on land, dries up and sends dangerous levels of hydrogen sulfide into the air around people's homes,\" congressional Rep. Scott Peters told House lawmakers last year.\"Coronado, in my district, is home to the Naval Special Warfare Command where Navy SEALs train in waters polluted with human feces,\" he said.Responding to the new IG report, the Naval Inspector General agreed that SEAL candidate safety is paramount but said that \"Naval Special Warfare cannot easily cancel or relocate 75 percent of its water training activities.\"\n",

Apu Gomes/Getty ImagesSam Delgado is a Future Perfect fellow writing about labor and food systems, public health, and literacy.The Palisades and Eaton fires in Los Angeles have destroyed over 10,000 structures — homes, businesses, and everything inside from bathroom cleaner to electrical wiring. Naturally, people in the Los Angeles area are reaching for their phones to see what the Air Quality Index (AQI) says about the air around them. But to the surprise of most people, the AQI has been good or moderate across Los Angeles, even in neighborhoods that have been most impacted by the fires. In Pasadena, the AQI went from a high 293 (a rating of “very unhealthy”) on January 11 to a low of 30 (a “good” rating) the next day. How can that be?Throughout the week, concerned residents attended calls run by leading organizations like the Coalition for Clean Air and local NPR station KCRW asking more questions, like: When entire neighborhoods full of buildings and cars burn, what’s released into the air? How far do they have to be from the fires to be safe from these pollutants? And how do they protect themselves from bad air?Air pollution is a silent killer that no one is immune to. Every year, 7 million people all across the globe die prematurely from the effects of air pollution. In the United States, exposure to air pollution is associated with 100,000 to 200,000 deaths annually. Long-term exposure can lead to a range of health effects in almost every organ system of the body, says Ed Avol, professor of clinical medicine at the University of Southern California’s (USC) Keck School of Medicine.Wildfires play natural, important roles in their ecosystems, particularly in western states like California. But human-caused climate change is causing these blazes to become more severe and more frequent. This means that more humans will be exposed to bad air.But just how bad is that air? Unfortunately the answer isn’t as straightforward as you might think. But here’s what we do and don’t know about air quality, and how to think about lowering the risk to air pollution.What the AQI does (and doesn’t) tell us about the airThe Environmental Protection Agency developed the AQI to give the public a tool to understand how good or bad the air is throughout the day. Using data collected by 5,000 air monitors placed all across the country, it tracks the levels of specific pollutants in the air, assigns it a number, and that number corresponds with a color-coded category to help people understand the quality of the air and what activities are safe to do in the outdoors. You can find the latest AQI on the EPA’s AirNow website or through its AirNow app. They also offer a fire and smoke map, which shows the AQI and what neighborhoods are under smoke outlooks.RelatedThe Air Quality Index and how to use it, explainedAs former Vox reporter Rebecca Leber explained:The AQI is calculated based upon five criteria pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act: fine particulate matter known as PM2.5, ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide. When you look at the AQI on your phone or on a website, the number it shows you represents the primary pollutant. The pollutants that drive the AQI number tend to be PM2.5 and ozone.In the case of the California wildfires, the pollution source is exposing millions of people in the greater Los Angeles area to smoke. And that smoke contains some pollutants that are outside of the scope of the AQI. “It’s correct that when all these things are burning, there’s a lot more toxic compounds in the air,” says Rima Habre, a professor of population and public health sciences at USC’s Keck School of Medicine. As fires burn down houses and buildings, the blazes can release certain volatile organic compounds, toxic metals, and toxic gases into our air — all of which the AQI does not account for. That’s causing people to worry about the air, and whether their health will be impacted in the long-term as it was for first responders in the 9/11 attacks. Ash from the wildfires, which can irritate your skin or lungs, falls out of the air and settles onto the ground and therefore is not accounted for in the AQI, Habre says. So the AQI could say that the air is good, even if there’s visible ash on your house or street.There are ways to measure the potential harmful pollutants and chemicals in the air that are outside of the AQI — that’s how we know they exist in the first place, Avol says. “But we don’t routinely measure all of these things, all the time, everywhere because that would be unfathomably expensive,” he added.Is the AQI still useful in the context of wildfires? Yes and no. It’s still an important resource, but it simply wasn’t designed for situations like these unprecedented mega wildfires burning down thousands of buildings and structures. But there are ways to help make choices around safety and risk, even when the AQI can’t tell us the full picture.How to think about risk and best protect yourselfWhen I attended air quality information webinars this week, I heard Los Angeles residents ask a lot of the same questions: How far do they have to be from the wildfires to be safe from bad air? How can they keep their families safe?The uncomfortable truth is that there isn’t a one-size-fits-all answer to these questions. You could live several miles away from the fires, but if the wind is moving in the direction of your home, you could be at risk for exposure to bad air. But both Avol and Habre say you can analyze your risk, and make decisions on how to lower your risk from exposure to bad air.First, take into account your own personal health and the health of your family. Does anyone have respiratory conditions, like asthma? Is anyone immunocompromised? If so, these are extra reasons to stay cautious of the air, Habre says.You can then check the AQI and observe your environment. If the AQI says the air is good, but it smells like smoke or there’s a lot of ash present, or if the wind is blowing in your direction while fire is present, take precautions: Limit your time outside, wear a well-fitting N95 mask, which can help filter out PM2.5. And, when you do have to go outside, make sure your shoes and clothes aren’t tracking in ash when entering your home. It’s also a good idea to run air purifiers indoors while keeping windows and doors shut.Understandably, it’s a difficult and scary time for Los Angeles residents. On top of losing entire homes and neighborhoods, the wildfires have forced us to face an uncomfortable truth, which is that life is not risk-free and that there is no way to completely protect ourselves from the consequences of disasters like these. But it doesn’t mean we’re totally powerless in lowering our risk to short and long-term health consequences. “There’s a lot of agency here,” Habre says. Making informed choices, even imperfect ones, may be the best way to move through this uncertain period.See More: Air QualityClimateNatural DisastersMost PopularTrump’s new passport rules are trapping transgender Americans in bureaucratic limboHow Democrats should respond to Trump’s war on DEIThe roots of Donald Trump’s fixation with South AfricaTake a mental break with the newest Vox crosswordTrump’s petty revenge on the artsToday, ExplainedUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Duke's energy-storage system, however, is expected to hold even more power: a total of 2,700 megawatts of energy across its service areas by 2031.This transition is part of a broader shift away from coal, driven by the need for clean energy sources. Duke's choice to meet grid energy needs with batteries over natural gas marks a break from past practices, joining a growing trend alongside solar leaders like California, Texas, and parts of the Southwest.Do you think our power grid needs to be upgraded?   Definitely      Only in some states      Not really      I'm not sure   Click your choice to see results and speak your mind.The construction will come in phases. First, Duke will build a battery system that can supply 50 megawatts of electricity to the grid continuously for up to four hours. It's slated for completion by the end of 2025.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementBy October 2027, a larger, more powerful battery system will replace the final coal unit. These batteries will store excess energy and provide reliable power during peak demand, a regional first for large-scale battery adoption.That said, Duke's batteries will \"not just rely on solar\" during the transition, spokesperson Bill Norton told Canary. To ensure 24/7 grid reliability, Duke is also building a 400-megawatt natural gas turbine nearby for prolonged demand surges, meaning gas will be mixed with solar to generate electricity.Watch now: CEO reveals form of energy that has 'polled across political lines' for over a decadeGrid batteries help stabilize energy supply during peak usage, reducing outages during extreme weather. They also store excess renewable energy, such as solar power, an area where North Carolina excels nationally. That reduces reliance on dirtier fuels, lowering planet-warming pollution while improving air quality. An ample supply of clean energy also makes electricity cheaper for surrounding communities.The replacement of coal plants with battery storage joins a growing number of coal-powered utilities shutting their operations. One of the nation's largest coal-fired plants in Ohio is set to close or be converted into a cleaner energy source by 2031. Coal plants in New Hampshire will close shop by 2027 and be repurposed into solar farms and battery capacity for offshore wind turbines.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAs Duke's spokesperson put it: \"Repurposing Allen's existing transmission system and infrastructure enables a more efficient clean energy transition.\"Join our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.AdvertisementAbout Our AdsSolve the daily Crossword41,377 people played the daily Crossword recently.

As a result, countries around the world that care about their citizens being able to breathe have introduced congestion policies to limit the number of gas-powered cars in particularly crowded areas. Of course, business owners love to claim charging people to drive into the city will ruin them financially, but a recent study from the UK’s Centre for Cities found that restricting automobile traffic doesn’t hurt businesses at all.Suggested ReadingLucid CEO Praises The 185-Mile EV, Judge Affirms Right To Repair Honda Passport Pricing In This Week's News RoundupNissan And Honda Will Merge No More, A Fake Buick GNX At The Superbowl And A Bad Pile Up Fit For The Movies In This Week's Car Culture RoundupCheap Leases On Expensive Cars, Used Cars To Avoid And The Best American Vehicles In This Week's Car Buying RoundupIt's Time To Discontinue The Model S | Jalopinions\n",

They were going to lose all their customers, and the lack of revenue would drive them to bankruptcy, they said. Using credit card transaction data from around the city, Centre for Cities found there was a small dip in spending right after the expanded ULEZ went into effect, but data from previous years shows that may have been a seasonal change, not the result of drivers having to pay to enter those parts of the city. Ultimately, the study came to the conclusion that “there was no above–expected negative spending effect caused by ULEZ’s expansion.”AdvertisementRelated ContentLondon’s Millionaires Actually Used Their Supercars For GoodAngry Drivers Are Sabotaging Cameras That Enforce London’s Latest Emission ChargeRelated ContentLondon’s Millionaires Actually Used Their Supercars For GoodAngry Drivers Are Sabotaging Cameras That Enforce London’s Latest Emission ChargeThat doesn’t necessarily mean no businesses were negatively affected at all.

Overall, though, it seems the foot and bike traffic made up for any customers who chose not to shop in the city because of the congestion charge, and it’s another piece of evidence that congestion charges don’t hurt businesses.AdvertisementWhat London’s expanded ULEZ has done, however, is help clean up the city’s air quality even faster than expected. That’s a big deal in a city known for having the worst air quality in the country. In a press release, the British government said: The report shows that London’s air quality at the roadside is continuing to improve at a faster rate than the average for the rest of England. In 2014, the gap in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels between London and the rest of England was 20 µg/m3, whereas now it is less than 5 µg/m3. The expansion brought five million more Londoners into the ULEZ, and today’s report shows that outer London - which has historically had worse air quality than the rest of England average – now has levels of pollution much closer to levels in the rest of the country. Even in the short six-month timeframe covered by the report, roadside NO2 concentrations in outer London have dropped by up to 4.4 per cent compared to what would have been expected without the London-wide expansion of the scheme. Given the size of outer London, every percent makes a huge difference....Today’s preliminary data reveals significant progress, with a further report expected in early 2025 which will examine the first full year of the London-wide ULEZ expansion. The one-year report will be supported by an independent advisory group of experts and provide an even more comprehensive analysis of the air quality and traffic impacts of the scheme.﻿AdvertisementCleaner air, quieter and more enjoyable neighborhoods, a more interconnected community and a lower risk of being run over?

will need to swap out hundreds of pieces'An Australian mining company made headlines when it placed a $400 million order for over 100 new all-electric mining equipment assets from a Chinese manufacturer, as reported by Electrek.Fortescue, an Australian mining company, purchased $400 million of mining equipment from Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group, the largest single equipment export deal in the Chinese company's history. The contract will bring electric mining equipment, including electric wheel loaders, electric dozers, and electric semitrucks, to Fortescue's operations within the next five years.\"We're moving rapidly to decarbonize our Pilbara iron ore operations and eliminate our Scope 1 and 2 terrestrial emissions by 2030,\" explained Fortescue Chief Executive Officer Dino Otranto. \"To achieve this target, we will need to swap out hundreds of pieces of diesel mining equipment at the end of their life with zero emissions alternatives. As the global mining industry continues to evolve, we're proud to be at the forefront of driving innovation in value adding green technology and showing the world that industry can decarbonize.\"If you were going to purchase an EV which of these factors would be most important to you?

      "As wildfires raged in California again this summer, the damages are adding up. In 2020 alone, wildfires killed 30 people and caused more than $19 billion in economic losses. On top of the immediate damages, the wildfires lead to pollution that is set to shave nearly a year off the life expectancy of residents in California’s most polluted counties if pollution levels persist. What is often ignored is that, fueled by climate change’s higher temperatures and drier conditions, the wildfires also contribute to climate change. A new analysis finds the wildfires in 2020 alone make up 30 percent of the state’s greenhouse gas emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The carbon dioxide from wildfires is not counted against California’s emissions targets. But if it were, the wildfires would be setting California back in meeting its climate goals, with the carbon emissions from California’s 2020 fire season alone making up 49 percent of the state’s 2030 emissions target. In fact, the analysis— published in the October edition of the peer-reviewed journal Environmental Pollution—showed that the increase in emissions in a single year is about two times the reductions achieved from 2003 to 2019.\n",
      "“To the great credit of California’s policy-makers and residents, from 2003 to 2019, California’s GHG emissions declined by 65 million metric tons of pollutants, a 13 percent drop that was largely driven by reductions from the electric power generation sector,” said Michael Jerrett, UCLA Fielding School of Public Health professor of environmental health sciences and an author of the study. “Essentially, the positive impact of all that hard work over almost two decades is at risk of being swept aside by the smoke produced in a single year of record-breaking wildfires.”\n",
      "California’s expansive wildfires were the second largest source of emissions in the state in 2020, behind only the transportation sector. While some of the carbon release from fires will be balanced by later vegetation regrowth, it will not occur quickly enough to avert highly dangerous levels of increased emissions, temperatures, and climate change, the researchers said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "“Although wildfires are a natural feature of many ecosystems in California, the increase in severe and frequent wildfire events has raised the possibility of transformed post-fire ecosystems,” said Dr. Miriam Marlier, a UCLA Fielding School professor and co-author. “Even if long-term regrowth occurs, however, the carbon emissions occurring in the next 15–20 years will make it difficult to reach emission reduction targets needed to avert the increases in mean global temperature advocated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.”\n",
      "The researchers also examined the financial costs. The carbon emissions released from the 2020 wildfires equate to more than $7 billion in total global damages, or about $986.9 million in damages to the United States and some $98.7 million in damages for California. These damages are on top of the fire control costs, damages from air pollution, and direct loss of life and property.\n",
      "“When policymakers are deciding how much to invest in wildfire prevention, it’s important for them to have a clear sense of all of the costs and benefits, and up until now, not enough attention has been paid to the climate costs,” said co-author Amir Jina, an assistant professor at the Harris School of Public Policy. “At the same time, the climate costs associated with wildfires have often been ignored in climate policy debates in the state. This analysis clearly shows that wildfire emissions need to be a key part of climate policy if California is going to meet its emission reduction goals.”\n",

These damages are on top of the fire control costs, damages from air pollution, and direct loss of life and property.</p>, <p>“When policymakers are deciding how much to invest in wildfire prevention, it’s important for them to have a clear sense of all of the costs and benefits, and up until now, not enough attention has been paid to the climate costs,” said co-author <a href=\"https://epic.uchicago.edu/people/amir-jina/\">Amir Jina</a>, an assistant professor at the Harris School of Public Policy. “At the same time, the climate costs associated with wildfires have often been ignored in climate policy debates in the state. This analysis clearly shows that wildfire emissions need to be a key part of climate policy if California is going to meet its emission reduction goals.”</p>, <p>—<em>Adapted from an article first published by the <a href=\"https://epic.uchicago.edu/news/wildfires-are-erasing-californias-climate-gains/\">Energy Policy Institute at UChicago</a>.</em></p>, <p class=\"c-newsletter__description\">Get more with UChicago News delivered to your inbox.</p>, <p class=\"c-recommended__text\">Scientists track sea ice loss with earthquake sensors</p>, <p class=\"c-recommended__text\">Climate change may help invasive species defoliate forests</p>, <p class=\"c-featured-news__component-title\">\n",

      "Approvals for new wind energy projects in federal lands and waters are temporarily halted in the U.S. That's after President Trump signed an executive order calling for the pause. The order may also threaten existing wind projects, both onshore and offshore. It calls for federal government agencies to not issue new permits, approvals and loans for wind projects pending a comprehensive multiagency review. The order uses misleading language to justify its provisions, incorrectly suggesting, among other things, that wind is not a reliable energy source and that offshore wind harms wildlife. Wind combined with energy storage like batteries and grid management can be a reliable and inexpensive energy source. There is also no evidence that the offshore wind industry kills large marine mammals like whales. Still, Trump specified in the order \"the importance of marine life, impacts on ocean currents and wind patterns.\" \n",

      "Building wind turbines produces some planet-heating carbon dioxide, but once operational, wind energy doesn't cause climate pollution like oil, gas and coal. And unlike fossil fuels, wind energy doesn't create air pollution. The offshore wind energy is still small in the U.S. Both onshore and offshore wind have faced challenges in recent years, including interest rates, supply chain problems and public opposition — over concerns about disrupting views and hurting tourism, as well as other doubts, some fueled by misinformation. \n",

      "How does this order affect wind projects?  The executive order halts offshore wind lease sales in federal waters. It says there will be no new permits or leases issued for wind projects on public lands and waters pending a review from multiple federal agencies. Wind energy advocates in Virginia and Massachusetts believe some offshore wind projects already operational or under construction in these states can still go ahead — at least for now. There is concern that the multiagency review could lead to some leases getting canceled. \"There's a lot of uncertainty now as to how all this is going to be implemented,\" says Francis Pullaro, president of RENEW Northeast, an association of energy industry and environmental advocates in New England. The order also could impact onshore wind projects on private lands, Grumet says. That's because the order could be interpreted to apply to federal permits sometimes used for wind projects, like permits that cover projects in the path of a migratory bird or bat. The order also calls for a temporary halt on a specific wind project in Idaho, the Lava Ridge project. Ørsted is a Danish wind company with a large number of wind projects in the U.S. Madeline Urbish, Ørsted's head of public affairs, Americas Region, tells NPR in an email, \"We are in the process of reviewing [the order] to assess the impact on our portfolio.\" How might this impact climate and energy goals? Many states have renewable energy and climate targets that require building offshore wind. New York has a goal of 9 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2035, which is enough electric power for about 1.7 million U.S. homes. New Jersey aims to build 11 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2040. That state has a goal to build a power sector with 100% clean energy by 2050. Trump's executive order \"puts those targets at risk,\" says Robert Freudenberg,  vice president for energy and environment at the Regional Plan Association, an energy nonprofit in the New York metropolitan area. \n",

      " \"We are not bringing enough power online fast enough to even meet baseline needs,\" Ohleth says. \"It's really frustrating to be excluding, categorically, one very robust and available at-scale energy supply.\" Do offshore wind turbines harm large marine life, like whales? There are no known links between whale deaths and offshore wind activities, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a federal agency. Still, many offshore wind critics, including Trump, say without evidence that the offshore wind industry causes whale deaths. There have been mysterious whale deaths on the East Coast in recent years, but the increase in whale deaths began in 2016, before preliminary research into offshore wind in the area began, Ohleth says. \n",

      "Researchers say whales are at risk from fishing nets, getting hit by ships and human-driven climate change. How are wind energy advocates reacting to the administration's order? Wind energy advocates say they could turn to the courts to oppose Trump's executive order. \"Our ambition is not to wind up immediately in litigation,\" Grumet says. \"But multibillion-dollar companies with multibillion-dollar projects on the line will obviously use all recourse if they believe that they're being unfairly undermined.\" Many anti-wind advocates are celebrating the executive order. In an emailed statement, REACT Alliance, a group opposing offshore wind in California, writes, \"We understand that the process of eliminating offshore wind on all of our coastlines will be a lengthy and complex process but we at REACT Alliance are confident the new administration is up to the task.\" The Trump transition team did not respond to NPR's request for comment. How might this impact American competitiveness in the wind industry? Governments around the world are embracing wind as a reliable source of electricity. For much of last year, wind was the biggest single source of electricity for the United Kingdom. \n",

      "On Friday morning, when authorities announced the closure of about 100 additional schools, the AQI stood at 185.\n",
      "As of 11am local time, Bangkok ranked as the eighth-most polluted city in the world, behind Dhaka, Lahore, Kathmandu, Karachi, Delhi, Mumbai and Ho Chi Minh City, according to IQAir.\n",
      "While hundreds of schools remain closed, only about 100,000 of Bangkok’s more than 10 million residents have signed up for a voluntary work-from-home scheme, according to the AFP news agency. Advertisement \n",
      "Bangkok Governor Chadchart Sittipunt said the rise in pollution was the result of the seasonal burning of crops, vehicle emissions and the burning of rubbish.\n",
      "The AQI index, which was developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, measures ground-level ozone, particle pollution including PM2.5 and PM10, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide.\n",

Understanding Types of Chronic Lung DiseasesIn the UK alone, lung cancer causes around 34,800 deaths annually, making up one in five cancer-related deaths.That's roughly 95 deaths per day.However, the patterns of incidence by subtype have shifted dramatically in recent decades. Among the four main subtypes of lung cancer - adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, small-cell carcinoma, and large-cell carcinoma - adenocarcinoma has become the dominant subtype in both men and women, the IARC found.Adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer that starts in mucus-producing glands that line the insides of the organs.This is why it can affect different areas of the body, including the lungs, breast, bowel, or stomach.Lung cancer rates in men have decreased over the past 40 years, while rates in women have risen.Men still make up most cases (1.6 million in 2022), but the gap between male and female diagnoses is narrowing, with 900,000 women diagnosed in 2022.Read More on The US SunDIRTY BIRD Eagles star has message to Taylor Swift with X-rated outfit at Super Bowl ParadeBAD RECORD  How Kanye pushed his tormented exes to the brink… including cruel deathbed vowAt the time, charities urged women to be as alert to potential lung cancer signs as they are to checking their breasts for lumps.WHAT IS LUNG CANCER + WHAT ARE THE 9 SYMPTOMS?LUNG cancer is the most deadly common cancer in the UK.It is considered a common cancer alongside prostate, breast and bowel, which together make up more than half of all new cases.Around 49,000 people are diagnosed with lung cancer every year and 35,000 die from it.Just one in 10 patients survive for a decade or more after being diagnosed and lung tumours make up 21 per cent of cancer deaths in the UK but only 13 per cent of cases.The main reason that it is so deadly is that symptoms are not obvious in the early stages, which is why it's sometimes called a 'silent killer'.When signs do appear they may include:A cough that lasts three weeks or more, and may hurtA cough that gets worseRepeated chest infectionsCoughing up bloodAn ache or pain when breathing or coughingPersistent breathlessnessPersistent tirednessLoss of appetiteUnexplained weight loss The NHS does not routinely screen for lung cancer but is rolling out more tests to smokers and ex-smokers at high risk, in a bid to catch it earlier. Testing may involve X-rays and chest CT scans.Smoking is the number one risk factor for lung cancer and accounts for about 70 per cent of cases.Risk may also be higher for people who have inhaled other fumes or toxic substances at work, such as asbestos, coal smoke or silica.TopicsBreast CancerCancer (disease)Health warningsLung cancerYOU MIGHT LIKERECOMMENDED FOR YOUMORE FOR YOUMore from The SunExclusiveDEADLY SECRET My dad was a mafia hitman - his sinister technique to transform into a killerShareSTAY STRONG Bachelorette's Katie Thurston diagnosed with breast cancer aged 34ShareYOU'LL BE NEXT Putin does not want peace & could launch more attacks, warns ZelenskyShareWATCH OUT!

      "Skai represents a bold reimagination of urban and regional air mobility. Designed as an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicle, it integrates advanced hydrogen fuel cell technology with a streamlined, functional design to create an efficient transportation solution. Unlike traditional helicopters that rely on noisy, fuel-guzzling engines or battery-powered drones constrained by limited range and long charging times, Skai provides a cleaner, more efficient alternative. Its hydrogen fuel cells enable flights up to 400 miles per charge with zero emissions, producing only water vapor and heat as byproducts. This makes it an environmentally responsible choice for passenger transport, cargo delivery, medical evacuations, and disaster relief.\n",
      "Designer: BMW Designworks\n",
      "BMW Designworks played a crucial role in shaping Skai’s appearance and passenger experience. The exterior maintains aerodynamic efficiency while emphasizing visual appeal. Inside, the cabin is spacious and adaptable, accommodating up to five passengers or supporting 1,000 pounds of cargo. Its versatility makes it ideal for both personal and commercial applications. Whether bypassing traffic as an air taxi or providing emergency relief in hard-to-reach areas, Skai aligns with modern urban demands while prioritizing sustainability.\n",

      "Skai\n",
      "Built for Safety\n",
      "Safety is central to Skai’s design, making it well-suited for urban air travel where reliability is essential. The aircraft incorporates multiple redundant systems to ensure safe operation. Its six independent rotors, powered by brushless electric motors, allow it to maintain stability even in the event of rotor failure. Redundancy extends to its hydrogen fuel cell system—if one fuel cell stack malfunctions, the others continue providing power. A triple-redundant autopilot system enhances flight stability and control, even during system failures.\n",
      "Skai\n",
      "Eliminating traditional helicopter components like gearboxes and tail rotors reduces potential failure points. Instead, Skai employs a simplified fly-by-wire control system that’s resistant to electromagnetic interference. Advanced LIDAR and camera sensors enhance real-time obstacle detection and situational awareness, essential for navigating dense urban airspace. In emergencies, an airframe-mounted parachute deploys if all other systems fail. The carbon fiber composite airframe flexes on impact to mitigate hard landings, while FAA-certified impact-absorbing seats with four-point harnesses further enhance safety. These elements collectively position Skai among the safest eVTOLs designed for urban mobility.\n",
      "Why Hydrogen?\n",
      "Hydrogen fuel cells power Skai’s propulsion system, offering distinct advantages over traditional battery-powered eVTOLs and fossil-fuel-based helicopters. It provides three times the energy density of lithium-ion batteries, enabling extended flight ranges and greater payload capacity without sacrificing performance. This makes it well-suited for applications requiring long-distance travel or rapid turnaround times between flights. Unlike batteries that require hours to recharge, hydrogen fuel cells can be refueled in under 10 minutes—a critical advantage for air taxi services and emergency response missions.\n",
      "Beyond operational benefits, hydrogen serves as a sustainable energy source. The fuel cells generate electricity through an electrochemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, with only water vapor and heat as byproducts—eliminating carbon emissions entirely. Additionally, 95% of materials used in the fuel cells are reusable, with 99% being recyclable, minimizing long-term environmental impact. Alaka’i Technologies supports renewable hydrogen production through solar, wind, and hydroelectric power sources, ensuring that Skai remains an environmentally conscious solution throughout its lifecycle. By harnessing hydrogen technology, Skai delivers practical advantages while setting a precedent for sustainable aviation.\n",
      "Quiet, Clean, and Comfortable\n",
      "Urban air mobility faces challenges related to noise pollution and passenger comfort—Skai addresses both with thoughtful engineering. Traditional helicopters generate significant noise due to high-speed rotors and combustion engines. Skai’s six electric rotors operate at low RPMs, substantially reducing noise levels and making it less disruptive in urban environments.\n",

Configurable seating arrangements accommodate up to five passengers or convert into cargo space capable of carrying up to 1,000 pounds. BMW’s influence is evident in the premium materials and ergonomic seating, ensuring a refined travel experience.\n",
      "Modern technology enhances passenger convenience. Ambient LED lighting and high-speed 5G connectivity allow for a connected and productive journey. Whether used for daily commutes or critical supply transport, Skai combines quiet operation with luxury, redefining air travel in urban settings.\n",
      "Ready for Takeoff\n",
      "While Skai remains in the FAA certification process, Alaka’i Technologies is optimistic about its future adoption across multiple industries. Once certified, large-scale production will begin, with plans to manufacture over 10,000 units annually.\n",
      "Skai\n",

It’s pretty thin, so we were surprised to see its 1,159Wh capacity. According to EcoFlow, this is enough to power the AC for up to eight hours in Eco Mode.EcoFlowIt’s nice to see you also get plenty of options to power the unit. You can use an AC outlet, DC port, car socket, or even solar panels. Just keep in mind you might not be able to run AC or heating when connected to a car, or using solar panels, due to insufficient power. EcoFlow claims this power source can run Fan Mode, though.It will also come with all the necessary venting accessories, but you won’t always need these. It’s specified no drainage is required in cooling mode with humidity under 70%, but you will need it for heating mode.If you want to bring your heating and cooling to the modern age, the EcoFlow WAVE 2 Portable Air Conditioner with Add-on Battery is an excellent offer at just $999 for the bundle. It will work great for smaller spaces, and the battery can keep it running, even during power outages. We’re not sure how long this coupon will be available, so act quickly!\n",

If it's an operational spill, we also compensate people and communities.\"The allegations come as a civil trial is expected to begin on Thursday at the High Court in London, where lawyers representing two Ogoniland communities of around 50,000 inhabitants will say Shell must take responsibility for oil pollution that occurred between 1989 and 2020, allegedly from its infrastructure.The communities say the spills have left them without clean water, unable to farm and fish, and created serious risks to public health.Shell, which has been pushing to sell its assets in the West African country to focus on offshore drilling and onshore gas, has indicated it will defend the claims.It denies wrongdoing and says spills in the region have been caused by sabotage, theft and illegal refining for which the company says it is not liable.The BBC has visited the affected areas in the Niger Delta, where Shell, the largest private oil and gas company in the country, discovered the existence of crude oil 68 years ago.The UN says at least 13 million barrels - or 1.5 million tonnes - of crude oil have been spilled since 1958 in at least 7,000 incidents in the Niger Delta region.The spills have left many families worried for their health and livelihoods.Grace Audi, 37, lives with her partner and two-year-old in Ogale in Rivers state, where there have been at least 40 oil spills from Shell's infrastructure, according to Leigh Day, the UK-law firm representing the communities in this case.Her family and neighbours only have access to a contaminated borehole, forcing them to buy clean water to use for drinking, cooking, washing and, once a day, flushing, at a cost of 4,500 Nigerian naira ($3, £2.40) - in an area where the average daily wage is less than $8.It is a familiar story to many in Niger Delta's Rivers state.Paulina Agbekpekpe told the BBC that lush greenery once surrounded thriving mangroves of her community in Bodo - which is not one of those going to court on Thursday. She said the rivers and ponds used to brim with all kinds of animals and fish, particularly periwinkle.\"The place was greener, not only mangroves, but all by the shoreline - there were pawpaw trees, palm trees and more. But during the spills, the destruction has polluted everywhere,\" the 50-year-old mother of six said.Her family had for generations survived on fishing, until a devastating spill 10 years ago.\"Most of the children - from the drinking water - have got diseases. Many have died. I've lost eight kids. My husband is sick.\"Because our livelihoods have been taken away, people in Bodo are hungry and suffering.\"In 2011, the UN's Environment Programme (UNEP) published a major study into the impact of pollution on the oil-rich area.It found members of one community in Ogoniland were drinking water contaminated with a known carcinogen at levels more than 900 times above the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline. The same chemical, benzene, was detected in all their air samples.It also found that sites that Shell's Nigerian subsidiary, the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC), claimed to have remediated, were still polluted and the techniques they used did not reach regulatory requirements.The report concluded that a comprehensive clean-up of the area would take 25-30 years - and it led to the formation of the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project (Hyprep).This was initially established by the Nigerian government in 2012, but no clean-up was started - until it was relaunched by a new government in December 2016.Hyprep was part-funded by oil companies including the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) and Shell, which gave $350m.Fishermen showed the BBC that oil is present in the waterways of OgonilandHowever, the BBC has seen internal documents that suggest representatives of Shell and of the Nigerian government were warned numerous times of the agency's alleged fraudulent practices.One person aware of the project spoke to the BBC about their concerns - and asked to remain anonymous out of a fear of reprisals.\"It's common knowledge that really what we're doing is a scam. Most of it is to fool the Ogoni people,\" the whistleblower said.\"It's a con perpetuated so that more money can be put into the pot and end up in the pockets of politicians and other people in power.\"The allegations about failings at Hyprep include:Contracts being awarded to companies that had no relevant experienceLaboratory results being falsified - sometimes labelling contaminated soil and water as cleanProject costs being inflatedExternal auditors on occasion being blocked from checking the clean-up on sites had been done properly.In the minutes of one meeting in 2023, attended by representatives from Shell's Nigerian subsidiary, the UNEP and Hyprep, it was pointed out that \"incompetent\" contractors were \"being engaged again\" and that they should \"not be allowed to further degrade the environment\".In a separate leaked report seen by the BBC from the same year, it was pointed out that laboratory results were \"regularly reported with deviations\".In 2022, the UN wrote to the Nigeria's environment ministry, warning that if nothing changed, the \"extremely poor standards\" of the clean-up would continue.The BBC has asked Hyprep and the Nigerian government to comment on the allegations but has received no response.But our investigation has revealed evidence that Shell was aware of the problems.In a meeting with the British high commissioner to Nigeria in January last year, minutes of which were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, Shell representatives acknowledged the \"institutional challenges\" of the clean-up agency and the chance of the refusal of \"future funding\" towards it.Shell told the BBC: \"Hyprep is an agency established and overseen by the federal government of Nigeria, with its governing council largely made up of senior ministers and government officials, along with five representatives of communities and NGOs and a single SPDC representative.\"AFPThe UN warned in 2011 it could up to 30 years to clean up the oil pollution in OgonilandThis is not the only remediation project in the Niger Delta that is alleged to have been botched.In 2015, Shell agreed to a £55m settlement for a clean-up after two catastrophic spills in 2008 from its infrastructure in the area Bodo.The company said the clean-up, conducted by the Bodo Mediation Initiative (BMI), which is meant to serve as a mediator between oil companies, including Shell, and the Bodo community (and is part-funded by the oil giant and Nigerian regulators) has been certified as 98% complete.However, the BBC visited sites within the area and found crude oil oozing from the soil and floating on waters.Shell and the BMI insist any occurrences of oil spills in the region are because of theft - known in the industry as \"oil bunkering\".\"There is a plan to call back the contractors to clean those areas to specification, to standard,\" Boniface Dumpe, a director at the BMI, told the BBC.\"It is the responsibility of all stakeholders, Shell, yes, to take care of their facilities, to ensure that re-oiling does not come from their facilities.\"But for the areas that have been cleaned. I would think that some responsibility is also for the community to ensure that some illegal activities does not also cause re-pollution.\"Shell said it takes active measures to prevent oil spills caused by oil bunkering.The company said: \"We take extensive steps to prevent this activity and the spills it causes including aerial surveillance, removing illegal connections on pipelines, and by building steel cages to protect wellheads.\"The alleged failings in the oil clean-up come as Shell prepares to sell its Nigerian subsidiary, the SPDC, to Renaissance Africa, a consortium of local and international companies.Patience Ogboe says she planted this crop of maize four months ago but it has not grown properlySome locals have accused the oil giant of \"running away\" from properly cleaning up the land and waters it is alleged to have polluted.They also fear Shell may still profit from the area by simply trading the oil extracted from the region in future.\"The operations of whichever oil operator takes over the relevant pipelines will have an enormous impact on their day-to-day life,\" Joe Snape, a lawyer at Leigh Day, told the BBC.\"There's incredibly little detail about what these deals will lead to.\"It is unclear how Renaissance [Africa] will act going forward. At least with Shell we have means of holding them to account.\"Mineral products, like petroleum oil and gas, account for 90% of exports from Nigeria, most of which comes from the Niger Delta region.Locals, whose main source of livelihood has been agriculture and fishing, told the BBC that since the discovery of oil, or what some refer to as \"black gold\", their home had been pumped for profit - by major oil companies, by oil thieves and by corrupt politicians.They say they have seen no benefit, only suffering - like Patience Ogboe who blames recent oil spills in Rivers state for her failing crops.\"Formerly if I harvest I can eat some with my family and even sell some… but for the past few years I could not get anything.

      "Florida has been struck with a phenomenon of dense fog that has what residents have described as a strange odor. In social media posts on Reddit and X, individuals have called the fog unusual from other fog common in Florida, much more dense and, well, smelly. The phenomenon has, of course, sparked conspiracy theories online in the absence of credible information, as cataloged by Futurism. Some Redditors have speculated the fog captured chemicals from manufacturing plants in the region, but there is no definitive evidence to prove the claim. The federal government is distracted these days with President Trump effectively shutting down organizations by the day and pressuring its workforce of 2 million to take early retirement offers. We might just be stuck with TikTok experts on this one. “Iâm not the conspiracy type,” said one Reddit user, “but this is 100% happening in central Florida. I thought it was smoke at first, but it is fog. And it has a smell I cannot describe.” Another agreed, saying, “I usually laugh at the conspiracy theorists, but this fog IS weird. Smells off and doesn’t really look like any fog I’ve seen in my 30 years living here.” Another wrote the fog “smells kinda like a mixture of gasoline and rubber. Honestly, I cannot really describe it.” Geo-engineering practices, such as efforts to seed clouds and produce rain, only lend more credence to the conspiracy theories.\n",

      "  ðVideo from the dense fog this morning. Foggy conditions continue along the immediate NE FL & SE GA coasts due to lingering sea fog moving onshore. https://t.co/r6rrFcJTai — NWS Jacksonville (@NWSJacksonville) February 11, 2025  An official with the National Weather Service told USA Today that the fog is just that, fog, but did not elaborate on the smell that individuals have reported. “If you shine, you know, any kind of light in the fog, what you’re actually seeing are the very, very small water droplets,” she told USA Today. “So that is likely what people are seeing.” Fog is commonly produced when dense warm air from the ocean moves over cold land.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gizmodo contacted the National Weather Service for more possible explanations but the agency declined to speculate. Users on Reddit have zeroed in on the Palatka Paper Mill located near Jacksonville as one possible culprit of the smelly fog, but that remains speculative. The paper mill is owned by the Koch Brothers, who have been major backers of President Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If there is any truth to the idea that pollution from manufacturing plants is to blame for the strange fog (what goes up must come down eventually), it seems like the problem will only become more prevalent as President Trump works to roll back environmental regulations and fast-track new projects worth at least $1 billion. It might be hard to remember now, but cities like Los Angeles used to have incredibly bad air quality before new tailpipe emissions standards were put in place for cars. These regulations are important, but the Republican party has long been a staunch opponent to heightened emissions standards. Maybe it should not be called fog at all but rather freedom fog.\n",

      "[<p>Florida has been struck with a phenomenon of dense fog that has what residents have described as a strange odor. In social media posts on Reddit and X, individuals have called the fog unusual from other fog common in Florida, much more dense and, well, smelly.</p>, <p>The phenomenon has, of course, sparked conspiracy theories online in the absence of credible information, as cataloged by <a href=\"https://futurism.com/florida-mysterious-fog-smell\"><em>Futurism</em></a>. Some Redditors have speculated the fog captured chemicals from manufacturing plants in the region, but there is no definitive evidence to prove the claim. The federal government is distracted these days with President Trump effectively shutting down organizations by the day and pressuring its workforce of 2 million to take early retirement offers. We might just be stuck with TikTok experts on this one.</p>, <p>“Iâm not the conspiracy type,” <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/comments/1in9yuu/comment/mc9ausd/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button\">said</a> one Reddit user, “but this is 100% happening in central Florida. I thought it was smoke at first, but it is fog. And it has a smell I cannot describe.” Another agreed, saying, “I usually laugh at the conspiracy theorists, but this fog IS weird. Smells off and doesn’t really look like any fog I’ve seen in my 30 years living here.” Another wrote the fog “smells kinda like a mixture of gasoline and rubber. Honestly, I cannot really describe it.” Geo-engineering practices, such as efforts to <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/feds-say-the-technology-they-use-to-control-the-weather-doesnt-work-2000544940\">seed clouds and produce rain</a>, only lend more credence to the conspiracy theories.</p>, <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">ðVideo from the dense fog this morning. Foggy conditions continue along the immediate NE FL &amp; SE GA coasts due to lingering sea fog moving onshore. <a href=\"https://t.co/r6rrFcJTai\">https://t.co/r6rrFcJTai</a></p>, <p>— NWS Jacksonville (@NWSJacksonville) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NWSJacksonville/status/1889404741605793994?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 11, 2025</a></p>, <p><script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\"></script></p>, <p>An official with the National Weather Service told <a href=\"https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/weather/2025/02/10/florida-fog-serratia-marcescens-bioweapons/78381967007/\"><em>USA Today</em></a> that the fog is just that, fog, but did not elaborate on the smell that individuals have reported. “If you shine, you know, any kind of light in the fog, what you’re actually seeing are the very, very small water droplets,” she told <em>USA Today</em>. “So that is likely what people are seeing.” Fog is commonly produced when dense warm air from the ocean moves over cold land.</p>, <p>Gizmodo contacted the National Weather Service for more possible explanations but the agency declined to speculate.</p>, <p>Users on Reddit have zeroed in on the Palatka Paper Mill located near Jacksonville as one possible culprit of the smelly fog, but that remains speculative. The paper mill is owned by the Koch Brothers, who have been major backers of President Trump.</p>, <p>If there is any truth to the idea that pollution from manufacturing plants is to blame for the strange fog (what goes up must come down eventually), it seems like the problem will only become more prevalent as President Trump works to <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/what-trumps-re-election-means-for-our-warming-planet-2000521203\">roll back environmental regulations</a> and fast-track new projects worth at least $1 billion. It might be hard to remember now, but cities like Los Angeles used to have incredibly bad air quality before new tailpipe emissions standards were put in place for cars. These regulations are important, but the Republican party has long been a staunch opponent to heightened emissions standards. Maybe it should not be called fog at all but rather <em>freedom</em> fog.</p>, <p class=\"post-tags\">\n",

      "AI algorithms can now emulate and improve climate models, reducing computational time and enhancing the reliability of climate projections. AI tools can even be deployed effectively to estimate exposure to air pollution at a very granular spatial level. We can jointly model exposure to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions and policy interventions and pinpoint the most effective regulatory actions that will have the most gains in reducing both while preserving the economy.

      "How AI Tools Can Increase Air Pollution\n",
      "All of these approaches will save lives. However, AI plays a complex role in climate change mitigation efforts, with positive and potentially concerning impacts. Considering AI's future outlook, we must assume that while AI offers significant potential to accelerate climate action, there are also valid concerns about its environmental footprint. According to the International Energy Agency, 2022, global data center electricity consumption accounted for 1-1.3% of global final electricity demand. A recent article in the MIT Technology Review mentions a Harvard study – which I have co-authored – where we reported that since 2018, carbon emissions from data centers in the US have tripled. For the 12 months ending August 2024, data centers were responsible for 105 million metric tons of CO2, accounting for 2.18% of national emissions (for comparison, domestic commercial airlines are responsible for about 131 million metric tons). About 4.59% of all the energy used in the US goes toward data centers, a figure that’s doubled since 2018.\n",
      "In summary, while AI offers powerful tools for climate action, its environmental footprint needs careful management. We must measure and monitor the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies and ongoing efforts to improve their energy efficiency and sustainability. There are many potential strategies to limit the carbon footprint of AI (for example, developing and using more efficient AI algorithms or increasing the energy efficiency of data centers by using free air cooling). Still, those approaches are in their infancy, and their effectiveness has not been studied. We must balance the pace of AI penetration in any sector of society with thoughtful consideration of its potentially harmful societal consequences.\n",

      "The Shokz OpenFit 2 wireless earbuds were designed specifically for me. I don't know how Shokz's engineers managed to pander to my lifestyle so perfectly; I suspect they hired spies, or my fiancee is a sleeper agent.Sunday Runday(Image credit: Android Central)In this weekly column, Android Central Wearables Editor Michael Hicks talks about the world of wearables, apps, and fitness tech related to running and health, in his quest to get faster and more fit.Ever since I reviewed the first-gen Shokz OpenFits in 2023, I've worn them for hundreds of runs, walks, and hikes, no exaggeration. My ear canals have had an unprecedented break from workout earbuds jammed into them, saving me from buds falling out during hard runs (which causes the sound to get worse), impacted ear wax, and the artificial hissing of transparency modes.Shokz OpenFit 2 at Amazon for $179.99But using them for over a year made me well aware of the OpenFit's many flaws, from an obnoxious charging issue to finicky touch controls and average sound quality. So, I'm thrilled that the Shokz OpenFit 2 immediately fixed or improved on almost all of my complaints.Shokz is best known for its bone conduction headphones, and I'm no audiophile to judge how the Shokz OpenRun Pro 2 sound quality compares to the OpenFit 2's air conduction. All I know is that I prefer the latter's \"natural\" sound while still giving me (mostly) unimpeded situational awareness during runs and races. And now, I'm much more likely to use the OpenFit 2's multipoint pairing and wear them in non-fitness contexts.Swipe to scroll horizontallyCategoryShokz OpenFit 2MaterialsPC, siliconeWeight9.4g (earbuds); 51g (case)ConnectivityBluetooth 5.4; Up to 2 devicesAudio profilesA2DP, AVRCP, HFPBattery life11 hours (56mAh); up to 270 days standbyCharging60 minutes in case; Up to 48 hours of charging capacity (600mAh)Frequency50Hz–16HzSensitivityWoofer: 965.dB ± 2.5dB; Tweeter: 94.5dB ± 3dBProtectionIP55 (earbuds, not case)Today's best OpenFit 2 deals $179.99View $179.99View $179.99ViewShow More DealsWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesMore comfortable than ever(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)My appreciation for the original OpenFit was how its ear hook placed the speaker directly over my ears without impeding them; I could safely hear approaching cyclists or \"on your left\" runners and even the sounds of nature if listening to quieter content like audiobooks. They've never once fallen off. I forget they're there aside from light pressure on the back and side of my ear, and the audio quality was good enough.The Shokz OpenFit 2 retains the same concept and target audience (athletes) but with minor tweaks that began with the Shokz OpenFit Air — which were more comfortable but too budget-focused to be \"better\" than the originals.The OpenFit 2 has a thinner outer hook that rounds into a softer, wider silicone edge than the original model. It's hard to describe the difference between the two, but the OpenFit 2 somehow sits more naturally in its over-ear position, while the original OpenFit feels as if it's pressing harder against my skin to stay in place. Plus, the thinner hook makes it take less ear-top space, sliding gracefully under my glasses temples without the same pressure as before.(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)Basically, you got used to the Shokz OpenFit's fit for abbreviated workouts, but you'll enjoy wearing the OpenFit 2 for longer stretches.The Shokz OpenFit design has no ANC and minimal passive blocking, but that's the whole point. I wear these while reading or doing chores around the house because I never miss my partner or cat calling for attention.There's some noise pollution for bass-heavy songs if you put the volume loud enough — so it may not be the best fit for an office environment — but at the normal 25% volume I use indoors, people only hear something if they fully disregard my personal space and lean in.Shokzingly rich sound(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)Equally important to comfort is sound, and the OpenFit 2 needed an upgrade. I noted that you \"shouldn't necessarily expect a symphony for your ears\" with the original OpenFits, defaulting to the Bass Boost option to offer reasonable low-end oomph and tolerating having to pump up the volume to the upper levels just to hear phone calls or podcasts clearly. At least for \"normal\" music, the sound sounded better than you'd expect, thanks to the \"DirectPitch\" tech.Shokz directly addressed these issues with the OpenFit 2, adding a larger low-frequency driver and an independent high-frequency unit for \"DualBoost Technology.\"Ditching the marketing speak, I feel much more comfortable using the stock EQ setting because it hits highs and lows in a balanced, rich way; \"luther\" by Kendrick Lamar & SZA sounds rich and harmonious for both the deep and high portions, while Tommy Richman's \"MILLION DOLLAR BABY\" hits those falsetto notes and low beat with equal quality.For folks seeking that alternative (or emo) feel, Billie Eilish's \"WILDFLOWER\" or Bon Iver's \"Holocene\" no longer sound quite as tinny as they did on the first-gen earbuds; in fact, the OpenFit 2 hits hard enough that even 50% volume is too loud for me for these quiet songs (unless I'm outside and dealing with ambient noise).Now that I've started using these earbuds for my daily work grind, I do use the Treble Boost or Voice EQ settings for my instrumental & lo-fi soundtracks or my YouTube Let's Plays, but they generally sound quite lovely.Honestly, the only negative to this audio boost is that when the music is loud enough, it'll get in the way of hearing your surroundings a bit. But as long as you're not blowing up your eardrums, you'll be bopping to the beat, and you'll remain alert.What else the Shokz OpenFit 2 fixedImage 1 of 3(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)Other key OpenFit 1-to-2 changes include a more energy-efficient Bluetooth chip, new physical buttons for touch controls, and one IP-level boost to water resistance.The jump from Bluetooth 5.2 to 5.4 lets the OpenFit 2 sit in a low-power mode for much longer in case you forget to put them in the charging case, as well as stay strongly connected in busy signal areas. The original OpenFit earbud had the same capacity, and yet the OpenFit 2 is rated to last 11 hours, a four-hour jump. In my experience, they did last easily across an entire workday of streaming, and ultramarathoners can depend on the OpenFit 2 more.By improving from IP54 to IP55 protection, Shokz made the OpenFit 2 capable of withstanding water jets; they're shower-proof and easier to safely clean under a strong sink, in other words. Your OpenFits are going to get gunked up with sweat over time, and the better resistance might make them last a bit longer before the speaker and mic quality are affected.My favorite upgrade is the new physical button, however. The first-gen OpenFit solely used touchpad controls, and I can't tell you how often they failed to recognize double-taps or made me accidentally hang up on people when I merely wanted to adjust their fit.By contrast, the new elevated buttons are easy to find and activate — but no longer something you'll press by mistake. They blend into the silver finish of the earbud, so they don't look tacky or old-fashioned. And most importantly, the touchpad only has one optional-on feature for Gemini or Siri, eliminating any confusion and frustration.Swipe to scroll horizontallyButton / touch shortcutActionTap button oncePlay/pause song; answer call; end callLong-press buttonLeft bud: volume down; right bud: volume upDouble-tap buttonNext track; reject callTriple-tap buttonPrevious trackLong-press touchpad areaActivate phone voice assistantThe most important Shokz OpenFit 2 change isn't something Shokz put in its specs sheet. After my initial review period, I noticed that the OpenFit would stay connected to my phone inside the charging case, meaning they weren't charging. I can't tell you how often I'd find one earbud dead and the other fully charged the next day. I'd have to wipe down the magnetic pins and shift the buds around, then close the case and check the app to see if both had successfully disconnected.I asked Shokz about this issue since many OpenFit owners had similar complaints. They assured me that the OpenFit 2 had fewer contact points (2 vs. 3) and a much stronger magnet than the last-gen buds. You're still supposed to \"keep the pins dry and clean during use to avoid any residue affecting proper contact,\" and it'll take months to see if a similar problem pops up; for now, though, I'm very optimistic, as I can feel how securely the OpenFit 2 snaps into place when inserted.Should you buy the Shokz OpenFit 2?I still have requests for the Shokz OpenFit 3, most notably wear detection — so they turn off and don't take calls when sitting outside the case — and a way to ping the charging case. If you buy the black OpenFit 2, choose a consistent place to put the case after workouts, or you will lose them constantly. Plus, the Shokz app should ideally notify you when the case hits 0%.But these complaints feel more nitpicky compared to the fundamental issues with the first-gen OpenFit. By and large, the Shokz OpenFit 2 sound fantastic, feel natural when worn with glasses, and let you keep your ear canals open instead of having hard plastic shoved into them for hours at a time.The Shokz OpenFit 2 won't match your wireless headphones or even normal wireless earbuds for surround-sound quality or ANC, so they may not be the right choice if you're looking for an all-day choice for every scenario that closely syncs with your smartphone. It's still a niche and fairly expensive product.That said, I fall within the target Shokz OpenFit 2 niche, and I'm supremely happy with them!\n",

So, I'm thrilled that the Shokz OpenFit 2 immediately fixed or improved on almost all of my complaints.</p>, <p>Shokz is best known for its bone conduction headphones, and I'm no audiophile to judge how the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" data-before-rewrite-localise=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openrun-pro-2-review\" href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openrun-pro-2-review\">Shokz OpenRun Pro 2</a> sound quality compares to the OpenFit 2's air conduction. All I know is that I prefer the latter's \"natural\" sound while still giving me (mostly) unimpeded situational awareness during runs and races. And now, I'm much more likely to use the OpenFit 2's multipoint pairing and wear them in non-fitness contexts.</p>, <p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.27%;\"><picture><source sizes=\"(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)\" srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AyNXziSDFKoETCqCbvepfZ-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AyNXziSDFKoETCqCbvepfZ-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AyNXziSDFKoETCqCbvepfZ-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AyNXziSDFKoETCqCbvepfZ-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AyNXziSDFKoETCqCbvepfZ-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AyNXziSDFKoETCqCbvepfZ-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"A photo of the reviewer wearing the Shokz OpenFit 2, with its ear hook looped next to his glasses.\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AyNXziSDFKoETCqCbvepfZ.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AyNXziSDFKoETCqCbvepfZ.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AyNXziSDFKoETCqCbvepfZ-320-80.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AyNXziSDFKoETCqCbvepfZ-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AyNXziSDFKoETCqCbvepfZ-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AyNXziSDFKoETCqCbvepfZ-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AyNXziSDFKoETCqCbvepfZ-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AyNXziSDFKoETCqCbvepfZ-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AyNXziSDFKoETCqCbvepfZ-1200-80.jpg 1200w\"/></picture></p>, <p>My appreciation for the original OpenFit was how its ear hook placed the speaker directly over my ears without impeding them; I could safely hear approaching cyclists or \"on your left\" runners and even the sounds of nature if listening to quieter content like audiobooks. They've never once fallen off. I forget they're there aside from light pressure on the back and side of my ear, and the audio quality was good enough.</p>, <p>The Shokz OpenFit 2 retains the same concept and target audience (athletes) but with minor tweaks that began with the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" data-before-rewrite-localise=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openswim-pro-and-openfit-air-review\" href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openswim-pro-and-openfit-air-review\">Shokz OpenFit Air</a> — which were more comfortable but too budget-focused to be \"better\" than the originals.</p>, <p>The OpenFit 2 has a thinner outer hook that rounds into a softer, wider silicone edge than the original model. It's hard to describe the difference between the two, but the OpenFit 2 somehow sits more naturally in its over-ear position, while the original OpenFit feels as if it's pressing harder against my skin to stay in place. Plus, the thinner hook makes it take less ear-top space, sliding gracefully under my glasses temples without the same pressure as before.</p>, <p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><picture><source sizes=\"(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)\" srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h2krhpdku4y736UtgmjhWW-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h2krhpdku4y736UtgmjhWW-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h2krhpdku4y736UtgmjhWW-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h2krhpdku4y736UtgmjhWW-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h2krhpdku4y736UtgmjhWW-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h2krhpdku4y736UtgmjhWW-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"A close-up of one Shokz OpenFit 2 earbud in the reviewer's left ear\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h2krhpdku4y736UtgmjhWW.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h2krhpdku4y736UtgmjhWW.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h2krhpdku4y736UtgmjhWW-320-80.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h2krhpdku4y736UtgmjhWW-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h2krhpdku4y736UtgmjhWW-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h2krhpdku4y736UtgmjhWW-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h2krhpdku4y736UtgmjhWW-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h2krhpdku4y736UtgmjhWW-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h2krhpdku4y736UtgmjhWW-1200-80.jpg 1200w\"/></picture></p>, <p>Basically, you got used to the Shokz OpenFit's fit for abbreviated workouts, but you'll enjoy wearing the OpenFit 2 for longer stretches.</p>, <p>The Shokz OpenFit design has no ANC and minimal passive blocking, but that's the whole point. I wear these while reading or doing chores around the house because I never miss my partner or cat calling for attention.</p>, <p>There's some noise pollution for bass-heavy songs if you put the volume loud enough — so it may not be the best fit for an office environment — but at the normal 25% volume I use indoors, people only hear something if they fully disregard my personal space and lean in.</p>, <p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.27%;\"><picture><source sizes=\"(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)\" srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/twSkN4wtPy6GpMkFrjxsua-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/twSkN4wtPy6GpMkFrjxsua-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/twSkN4wtPy6GpMkFrjxsua-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/twSkN4wtPy6GpMkFrjxsua-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/twSkN4wtPy6GpMkFrjxsua-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/twSkN4wtPy6GpMkFrjxsua-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"The Shokz OpenFit 2 earbuds sitting on a rock, both flipped over to show the main speakers that sit against your ears.\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/twSkN4wtPy6GpMkFrjxsua.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/twSkN4wtPy6GpMkFrjxsua.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/twSkN4wtPy6GpMkFrjxsua-320-80.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/twSkN4wtPy6GpMkFrjxsua-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/twSkN4wtPy6GpMkFrjxsua-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/twSkN4wtPy6GpMkFrjxsua-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/twSkN4wtPy6GpMkFrjxsua-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/twSkN4wtPy6GpMkFrjxsua-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/twSkN4wtPy6GpMkFrjxsua-1200-80.jpg 1200w\"/></picture></p>, <p>Equally important to comfort is sound, and the OpenFit 2 needed an upgrade. I noted that you \"shouldn't necessarily expect a symphony for your ears\" with the original OpenFits, defaulting to the Bass Boost option to offer reasonable low-end oomph and tolerating having to pump up the volume to the upper levels just to hear phone calls or podcasts clearly. At least for \"normal\" music, the sound sounded better than you'd expect, thanks to the \"DirectPitch\" tech.</p>, <p>Shokz directly addressed these issues with the OpenFit 2, adding a larger low-frequency driver and an independent high-frequency unit for \"DualBoost Technology.\"</p>, <p>Ditching the marketing speak, I feel much more comfortable using the stock EQ setting because it hits highs and lows in a balanced, rich way; \"luther\" by Kendrick Lamar &amp; SZA sounds rich and harmonious for both the deep and high portions, while Tommy Richman's \"MILLION DOLLAR BABY\" hits those falsetto notes and low beat with equal quality.</p>, <p>For folks seeking that alternative (or emo) feel, Billie Eilish's \"WILDFLOWER\" or Bon Iver's \"Holocene\" no longer sound quite as tinny as they did on the first-gen earbuds; in fact, the OpenFit 2 hits hard enough that even 50% volume is too loud for me for these quiet songs (unless I'm outside and dealing with ambient noise).</p>, <p>Now that I've started using these earbuds for my daily work grind, I do use the Treble Boost or Voice EQ settings for my instrumental &amp; lo-fi soundtracks or my YouTube Let's Plays, but they generally sound quite lovely.</p>, <p>Honestly, the only negative to this audio boost is that when the music is loud enough, it'll get in the way of hearing your surroundings a bit. But as long as you're not blowing up your eardrums, you'll be bopping to the beat, <em>and</em> you'll remain alert.</p>, <p>Other key OpenFit 1-to-2 changes include a more energy-efficient Bluetooth chip, new physical buttons for touch controls, and one IP-level boost to water resistance.</p>, <p>The jump from Bluetooth 5.2 to 5.4 lets the OpenFit 2 sit in a low-power mode for much longer in case you forget to put them in the charging case, as well as stay strongly connected in busy signal areas. The original OpenFit earbud had the same capacity, and yet the OpenFit 2 is rated to last 11 hours, a four-hour jump. In my experience, they did last easily across an entire workday of streaming, and ultramarathoners can depend on the OpenFit 2 more.</p>, <p>By improving from IP54 to IP55 protection, Shokz made the OpenFit 2 capable of withstanding water jets; they're shower-proof and easier to safely clean under a strong sink, in other words. Your OpenFits are going to get gunked up with sweat over time, and the better resistance might make them last a bit longer before the speaker and mic quality are affected.</p>, <p>My favorite upgrade is the new physical button, however. The first-gen OpenFit solely used touchpad controls, and I can't tell you how often they failed to recognize double-taps or made me accidentally hang up on people when I merely wanted to adjust their fit.</p>, <p>By contrast, the new elevated buttons are easy to find and activate — but no longer something you'll press by mistake. They blend into the silver finish of the earbud, so they don't look tacky or old-fashioned. And most importantly, the touchpad only has one optional-on feature for <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" data-before-rewrite-localise=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini\" href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini\">Gemini</a> or Siri, eliminating any confusion and frustration.</p>, <p><em>The</em> most important Shokz OpenFit 2 change isn't something Shokz put in its specs sheet. After my initial review period, I noticed that the OpenFit would stay connected to my phone inside the charging case, meaning they weren't charging. I can't tell you how often I'd find <em>one</em> earbud dead and the other fully charged the next day. I'd have to wipe down the magnetic pins and shift the buds around, then close the case and check the app to see if both had successfully disconnected.</p>, <p>I asked Shokz about this issue since many OpenFit owners had similar complaints. They assured me that the OpenFit 2 had fewer contact points (2 vs. 3) <em>and</em> a much stronger magnet than the last-gen buds. You're still supposed to \"keep the pins dry and clean during use to avoid any residue affecting proper contact,\" and it'll take months to see if a similar problem pops up; for now, though, I'm very optimistic, as I can feel how securely the OpenFit 2 snaps into place when inserted.</p>, <p>I still have requests for the Shokz OpenFit 3, most notably wear detection — so they turn off and don't take calls when sitting outside the case — and a way to ping the charging case. If you buy the black OpenFit 2, choose a consistent place to put the case after workouts, or you <em>will</em> lose them constantly. Plus, the Shokz app should ideally notify you when the case hits 0%.</p>, <p>But these complaints feel more nitpicky compared to the fundamental issues with the first-gen OpenFit. By and large, the Shokz OpenFit 2 sound fantastic, feel natural when worn with glasses, and let you keep your ear canals open instead of having hard plastic shoved into them for hours at a time.</p>, <p>The Shokz OpenFit 2 won't match your <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" data-before-rewrite-localise=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones\" href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones\">wireless headphones</a> or even normal <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" data-before-rewrite-localise=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds\" href=\"https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds\">wireless earbuds</a> for surround-sound quality or ANC, so they may not be the right choice if you're looking for an all-day choice for every scenario that closely syncs with your smartphone. It's still a niche and fairly expensive product.</p>, <p>That said, I fall within the target Shokz OpenFit 2 niche, and I'm supremely happy with them!</p>, <p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" data-bordeaux-image-check=\"\" style=\"padding-top:100.00%\"><picture><source sizes=\"(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)\" srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RntUEN2mZQ4SHNbbiBQfJF-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RntUEN2mZQ4SHNbbiBQfJF-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RntUEN2mZQ4SHNbbiBQfJF-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RntUEN2mZQ4SHNbbiBQfJF-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RntUEN2mZQ4SHNbbiBQfJF-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RntUEN2mZQ4SHNbbiBQfJF-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w\" type=\"image/webp\"/><img alt=\"Render of the Shokz OpenFit 2 wireless earbuds and case\" class=\"featured_image\" data-original-mos=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RntUEN2mZQ4SHNbbiBQfJF.jpg\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RntUEN2mZQ4SHNbbiBQfJF.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RntUEN2mZQ4SHNbbiBQfJF-320-80.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RntUEN2mZQ4SHNbbiBQfJF-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RntUEN2mZQ4SHNbbiBQfJF-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RntUEN2mZQ4SHNbbiBQfJF-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RntUEN2mZQ4SHNbbiBQfJF-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RntUEN2mZQ4SHNbbiBQfJF-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RntUEN2mZQ4SHNbbiBQfJF-1200-80.jpg 1200w\"/></picture></p>, <p></p>, <p><em><strong>Built for runners</strong></em></p>, <p>Fans of bone conduction headphones know and love Shokz, but the Shokz OpenFit 2 switches to air conduction while keeping the same driving principle: enjoy music without relying on transparency modes or having your ears crammed with bulky earbuds for hours on end.

He was attending culinary arts school in Dallas. He was meal prepping and hitting the gym regularly, focused on getting a degree and setting up his life right.\n",

      "His symptoms were easy to dismiss, at least at first. \"I had a real bad stomach ache that was going on for about a month,\" he told Business Insider. \"I thought, 'Oh, maybe I ate some sushi, some fish or something that was undercooked.'\"Except food poisoning doesn't typically last for weeks on end, and doesn't leave blood in your stool. He rapidly lost weight, from 175 pounds to 145 in a single summer — without eating less. \"I was pretty much like a skeleton,\" he said.\n",

      "Stories like Lopez's are increasingly common. Colon cancer rates are rocketing among athletic young people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s, and survival rates are dropping.Take Chris Rodriguez, a 37-year-old improv actor and CrossFit enthusiast who adheres to a high-fiber, high-protein diet, with plenty of veggies. He was 35 when he was diagnosed with stage 3 rectal cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The question pops in your mind, 'What else was I supposed to do?',\" Rodriguez told BI. \"That's really the unfortunate thing with a diagnosis like this, is there isn't really much else that you're supposed to do, outside of looking for symptoms.\"The most convenient explanations for the rise in young colon cancer are diet and weight. We know diet can influence colorectal cancer risk, and it's something people can fix, to a degree. Plus, our diets have changed. These days we all consume more sugar, more ultra-processed foods, more oil and butter, while moving less.Still, doctors say the trend we're seeing now defies neat categories of genetics or lifestyle, and it's baffling. Other factors are clearly messing with our digestive systems, but they're tough to pinpoint. Pollution, microplastics, and artificial light — all are pervasive in society, yet very tricky to study.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to recent research, we are starting to get a better picture of why young colon cancer cases are rising, and we're on the cusp of some pretty big results that may uncover better ways to prevent and treat it.Young colon cancer is getting deadlier and more commonSomething shifted in the 1960s. Everyone born after 1960 has a higher colon cancer risk than previous generations. This phenomenon is known as the \"birth cohort effect.\"\"The rise that we're seeing cannot just be accounted for by inherited differences,\" Dana Farber colon cancer researcher Dr. Marios Giannakis told BI.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the US, young colon cancer rates have been rising about 3% every year since the early 1990s, according to National Cancer Institute data.\"We do think since genetics haven't changed, the cancers that are increasing are environmentally based,\" Dr. William Dahut, the chief science officer at the American Cancer Society, said during a recent briefing to reporters. \"Exactly what's doing it is really — more research is needed.\"The biggest cancer centers in the US are opening units to investigate this trend. In 2018, Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York opened a first-of-its-kind center for \"young-onset\" colorectal cancer patients. Dana Farber in Boston, Mass General, MD Anderson Cancer Center, and Columbia University Irving Medical Center followed close behind, all opening special programs for young colon cancer cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2021, the CDC took action, lowering the age of recommended colon cancer screening from 50 to 45. It's an effort to catch more young colon cancer cases sooner, upping the odds of people surviving.It isn't a uniquely American issue. Wealthy countries, in particular, are seeing similar spikes. New Zealand, Chile, Norway, and Turkey are among 27 countries recording record-high rates of young colon cancer.Diets matter — to an extent\n",

      "It's hard to dismiss the role our changing food landscape has played. We are undoubtedly eating worse than our grandparents did 100 years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Take fiber, for example. Found in abundance in whole plant foods like beans, it is a nutrient clearly associated with lower risk of cancer.Some of the most popular foods in US supermarkets — prepackaged for our convenience — tend to have fiber stripped out during processing, and extra salt, sugar, and oils added in to make them more palatable and shelf-stable.It started in the aftermath of World War II, when industrial processing and factory farming took hold nationwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Essentially we redeployed what had allowed the United States and allies to prevail in that war to non-military applications, and it completely transformed agriculture,\" Dr. David Katz, a leading expert in chronic disease prevention and nutrition, told BI.\"You only have a certain total number of calories you can eat per day, and if a higher percentage of those is made up of hamburgers and Pop-Tarts, then a lower percentage ipso facto is made up of lentils and all the other good stuff.\"Ultra-processed foods now account for a significant proportion of what we eat. Excess sugar, salt, and chemicals lurk in pasta sauce, breakfast cereals, and salad dressing. Brown bread labeled \"heart healthy\" can have a higher sugar content than white Wonderbread.\n",

      "Upsetting the balance of nutrients in our guts has consequences.

      "Doctors and lab scientists who spoke to BI for this story all said the rise in millennials getting colon cancer likely won't be attributed to one single thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shuji Ogino, an epidemiology professor at Harvard Medical School, has been studying young colon cancer cases across the world. He published a study in Nature that showed the early life \"exposome\" — diet, lifestyle, environment, exposures — has changed dramatically, becoming conducive to cancer.We've introduced lots of new things to our environment without knowing the ramifications. Now, we're starting to see the long-term effects.Something as simple as artificial light could play a role. \"That's something no human being experienced 200 years ago,\" Ogino said. Lights allow us to work and socialize at all hours, impacting how our body clocks regulate hormones and metabolism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Heinz-Josef Lenz, co-lead of the gastrointestinal cancer program at the University of Southern California cancer center, is also studying how the environment may be damaging our DNA in ways we don't yet understand.His data so far suggests the trend of more younger folks developing colon cancer isn't genetic, but our genes may affect how we respond to our exposures — the processed food we eat, the antibiotics we take, and the polluted air we breathe.\"When you are 16 years old or 20 years old, you cannot blame it on diet or exercise or obesity — it's just too short,\" he said. \"We're just scratching the surface on better understanding the impact of the parents, particularly in the young onset: was their exposure part of it, or not?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are five things we're learning:1. Sleep cycleWe can't separate gut health from our internal clock.Gut bacteria help regulate sleep, which cuts cancer risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emerging evidence suggests that disrupting the circadian rhythm creates problems in the gut that can contribute to colon cancer, according to studies in mice and data in humans. Our sleep can be derailed by late schedules and artificial light from our homes and phones, which may be one factor in rising colon cancer cases.2. Microplastics in air and waterIncreasingly, researchers are finding evidence that microplastics play a negative role in fertility.They can also be pro-inflammatory, driving diseases like cancer and obesity, hurting lungs, and possibly helping cancer to thrive in the body.\n",
      "\n",
      "A new evidence roundup from researchers at UCSF analyzed 22 studies that compared microplastic exposure to health problems in mice and people, and found that all of them showed some harm.\"We basically saw this continuous effect that the more you get exposed to it, so in our environment, the more it gets produced, the greater the health harm,\" Nicholas Chartres, one of the study's authors and a former head of the science and policy team at UCSF's program on reproductive health and the environment, told BI.Chartres says the time is now to act to reduce our microplastic exposure, and it must be done at a policy level. At home, Chartres runs around the house throwing out his kids' plastic toys, but he knows he's playing a losing game of environmental whack-a-mole.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We don't need to have specific quantification of the level of harm, there's enough here to show that they're certainly contributing,\" he said.3. What your parents were exposed toLenz is conducting research that aims to unravel why so many Hispanic patients in Southern California seem to be especially at risk of developing early colon cancer.His team is studying cancer patients' blood, DNA damage, lifestyles, and ZIP codes to pinpoint where their exposure risks might be coming from, whether it be overuse of antibiotics, pollution that families are exposed to, or something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It could be an epigenetic event, not only from the patient itself but from the family, from the parents and their exposure,\" he said. \"Epigenetics can be influenced by lifestyle and by exposure to chemicals, or whatever it is that will actually react.\"4. AntibioticsIt is well established that antibiotics disrupt the gut microbiome, killing off some beneficial bacteria. And humans aren't the only antibiotic consumers.Most of the antibiotics (73%) in use worldwide are for meat production, recent research suggests. Some meat advertised as antibiotic-free has failed independent testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Red meat consumption ups a person's colon cancer risk, and so does antibiotic use, but these two factors aren't necessarily separate.5. C-sectionNewborns are exposed to trillions of their mother's microbes as they travel through the birth canal, giving an infant's microbiome an initial boost. Kids who are delivered through the abdomen via cesarean section don't get those same health benefits.Recent research from Sweden suggests girls who are born via c-section have a higher risk of developing young colon cancer than those born vaginally.\n",

      "There's more to come. Multiple big, well-funded multinational studies are underway, including a US-UK collaboration that's giving out interdisciplinary cancer grants to teams around the world. The studies are expected to release results this year and next.2 ways to reduce your risk todayUntil we know better what's going on, researchers and clinicians say there are two steps you can take to reduce colon cancer risk.First, control what you can control.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Let's focus on the stuff we can change,\" Dr. Cassandra Fritz, a gastroenterologist and colon cancer researcher at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, tells her patients.That means no smoking, regular exercise, less alcohol, reducing your intake of ultra-processed snacks and processed meats, and no sugary beverages — factors directly linked with colon cancer risk. You could also consider microwaving food in glass or ceramic instead of plastic.Second, know the signs of colon cancer and do not be complacent about them. Many young cases are diagnosed too late, making treatment complicated.\n",
      "\n",
      "These four symptoms can occur up to 18 months before a colon cancer diagnosis:Abnormal diarrhea that lasts for weeksPersistent abdominal painBloody stool (red, magenta, or black)Iron deficiency anemia (determined by a blood test)Don't fear the process of getting checked, experts told BI. Anyone dealing with these persistent symptoms can ask their doctor for a fecal immunochemical test (FIT) that is noninvasive and costs just a few dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If there are symptoms which could be associated with colon cancer, make sure you get the screening and don't just accept that they're saying 'It's unlikely' or 'I've never seen it,'\" Lenz said.When it's spotted early, colon cancer is a very survivable disease.\n",

      "[<p>At 30, Chris Lopez was hitting his stride. He was attending culinary arts school in Dallas. He was <a class=\"\" data-analytics-product-module=\"body_link\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-a-busy-dad-freezer-preps-meals-for-his-family-2024-11\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\">meal prepping</a> and hitting the gym regularly, focused on getting a degree and setting up his life right.</p>, <p>His symptoms were easy to dismiss, at least at first. \"I had a real bad stomach ache that was going on for about a month,\" he told Business Insider. \"I thought, 'Oh, maybe I ate some sushi, some fish or something that was undercooked.'\"</p>, <p>Except food poisoning doesn't typically last for weeks on end, and doesn't leave blood in your stool. He <a class=\"\" data-analytics-product-module=\"body_link\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/losing-weight-too-quickly-effects-scary-2018-5\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\">rapidly lost weight</a>, from 175 pounds to 145 in a single summer — without eating less. \"I was pretty much like a skeleton,\" he said.</p>, <p>Lopez went to his doctor, who eventually decided to do a colonoscopy to learn more. That's when they discovered a \"grapefruit-sized\" tumor in his colon, he said. Lopez saw the scan and couldn't believe his eyes. <a class=\"\" data-analytics-product-module=\"body_link\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/scientists-uncover-processed-foods-fuel-colon-cancer-how-offset-damage-2024-12\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Colon cancer</a>? He was so young, healthy, and fit.</p>, <p>Stories like Lopez's are increasingly common. <a class=\"\" data-analytics-product-module=\"body_link\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/where-colon-cancer-on-the-rise-reasons-why-2024-12\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Colon cancer rates</a> are rocketing among athletic young people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s, and survival rates are dropping.</p>, <p>Take Chris Rodriguez, a 37-year-old improv actor and CrossFit enthusiast who adheres to a <a class=\"\" data-analytics-product-module=\"body_link\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-spector-increase-fiber-plant-based-protein-sources-2025-1\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\">high-fiber, high-protein diet</a>, with plenty of veggies. He was 35 when he was diagnosed with stage 3 rectal cancer.</p>, <p>\"The question pops in your mind, 'What else was I supposed to do?',\" Rodriguez told BI. \"That's really the unfortunate thing with a diagnosis like this, is there isn't really much else that you're supposed to do, outside of looking for <a class=\"\" data-analytics-product-module=\"body_link\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-to-know-about-colon-cancer-symptoms-diagnosis-chadwick-boseman\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\">symptoms</a>.\"</p>, <p>The most convenient explanations for the rise in young colon cancer are diet and weight. We know diet can influence colorectal cancer risk, and it's something people can fix, to a degree. Plus, our diets <em>have</em> changed. These days we all consume more sugar, more <a class=\"\" data-analytics-product-module=\"body_link\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-ultra-processed-foods-impact-your-body-calories-weight-gain-2025-1\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\">ultra-processed foods</a>, more oil and butter, while moving less.</p>, <p>Still, doctors say the trend we're seeing now defies neat categories of genetics or lifestyle, and it's baffling.<strong> </strong>Other factors are clearly messing with our digestive systems, but they're tough to pinpoint. Pollution, <a class=\"\" data-analytics-product-module=\"body_link\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/microplastics-found-in-human-testicles-what-to-do-2024-5\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\">microplastics</a>, and artificial light — all are pervasive in society, yet very tricky to study.</p>, <p>Thanks to recent research, we are starting to get a better picture of why young colon cancer cases are rising, and we're on the cusp of some pretty big results that may uncover better ways to prevent and treat it.</p>, <p>Something shifted in the 1960s. Everyone born after 1960 has a higher colon cancer risk than previous generations. This phenomenon is known as the \"birth cohort effect.\"</p>, <p>\"The rise that we're seeing cannot just be accounted for by inherited differences,\" Dana Farber colon cancer researcher Dr. Marios Giannakis told BI.</p>, <p>In the US, young colon cancer rates have been rising about 3% every year since the early 1990s, according to National Cancer Institute data.</p>, <p>\"We do think since genetics haven't changed, the cancers that are increasing are environmentally based,\" Dr. William Dahut, the chief science officer at the American Cancer Society, said during a recent briefing to reporters. \"Exactly what's doing it is really — more research is needed.\"</p>, <p>The biggest cancer centers in the US are opening units to investigate this trend. In 2018, Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York opened a first-of-its-kind center for \"young-onset\" colorectal cancer patients. Dana Farber in Boston, Mass General, MD Anderson Cancer Center, and Columbia University Irving Medical Center followed close behind, all opening special programs for young colon cancer cases.</p>, <p>In 2021, the CDC took action, lowering the age of recommended colon cancer screening from 50 to 45. It's an effort to catch more young colon cancer cases sooner, upping the odds of people surviving.</p>, <p>It isn't a uniquely American issue. Wealthy countries, in particular, are seeing similar spikes. New Zealand, Chile, Norway, and Turkey are among 27 countries recording record-high rates of young colon cancer.</p>, <p>It's hard to dismiss the role our changing food landscape has played. We are undoubtedly eating worse than our grandparents did 100 years ago.</p>, <p>Take fiber, for example. Found in abundance in whole plant foods like beans, it is a nutrient clearly associated with lower risk of cancer.</p>, <p>Some of the most popular foods in US supermarkets — prepackaged for our convenience — tend to have fiber stripped out during processing, and extra salt, sugar, and oils added in to make them more palatable and shelf-stable.</p>, <p>It started in the aftermath of World War II, when industrial processing and factory farming took hold nationwide.</p>, <p>\"Essentially we redeployed what had allowed the United States and allies to prevail in that war to non-military applications, and it completely transformed agriculture,\" Dr. David Katz, a leading expert in chronic disease prevention and nutrition, told BI.</p>, <p>\"You only have a certain total number of calories you can eat per day, and if a higher percentage of those is made up of hamburgers and Pop-Tarts, then a lower percentage ipso facto is made up of lentils and all the other good stuff.\"</p>, <p>Ultra-processed foods now account for a significant proportion of what we eat. Excess sugar, salt, and chemicals lurk in pasta sauce, breakfast cereals, and salad dressing. Brown bread labeled \"heart healthy\" can have a higher sugar content than white Wonderbread.</p>, <p>Upsetting the balance of nutrients in our guts has consequences. Compounds that aren't necessarily harmful in moderation, like omega-6 fatty acids from <a data-analytics-product-module=\"body_link\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/are-seed-oils-dangerous-for-your-health-inflammation-evidence-2024-11\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\">seed oils</a>, take up a disproportionate part of our diets. That can lead to inflammation, infection, and diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and, yes, colon cancer.</p>, <p>Your microbiome is not just about what you eat. It's influenced by myriad factors, from how you were born to your work schedule.</p>, <p>Doctors and lab scientists who spoke to BI for this story all said the rise in millennials getting colon cancer likely won't be attributed to one single thing.</p>, <p>Shuji Ogino, an epidemiology professor at Harvard Medical School, has been studying young colon cancer cases across the world. He published a <a data-am-orig-url=\"https://affiliate.insider.com/?h=1c20d71fa38daf2e24609e95c1071d0f131d7b348557c3c5cb4b32296ab0b1ab&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41571-022-00672-8.epdf%3Fsharing_token%3D1umLnn8X8BYzX5QTMHyArtRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0Mbf4RPi-ocNFWHJz8DUBZsAPhKJF2UqgYLHsA0Cpbtq9pHyF5VY4_JUzOCW23Ny67AuPivP2QGjseGKUadh2IPLERt0L07AH5dSEBqCheSrvp_NMPuByyxFdBZ3yftAdU%253D\" data-analytics-product-module=\"body_link\" href=\"https://affiliate.insider.com/?h=1c20d71fa38daf2e24609e95c1071d0f131d7b348557c3c5cb4b32296ab0b1ab&amp;platform=browser&amp;postID=67897b6a6f72cdb8614c4970&amp;postSlug=colon-cancer-environmental-causes-microplastics-antibiotics-sleep-2025-1&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41571-022-00672-8.epdf%3Fsharing_token%3D1umLnn8X8BYzX5QTMHyArtRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0Mbf4RPi-ocNFWHJz8DUBZsAPhKJF2UqgYLHsA0Cpbtq9pHyF5VY4_JUzOCW23Ny67AuPivP2QGjseGKUadh2IPLERt0L07AH5dSEBqCheSrvp_NMPuByyxFdBZ3yftAdU%253D\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noindex\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> in Nature that showed the early life \"exposome\" — diet, lifestyle, environment, exposures — has changed dramatically, becoming conducive to cancer.</p>, <p>We've introduced lots of new things to our environment without knowing the ramifications. Now, we're starting to see the long-term effects.</p>, <p>Something as simple as artificial light could play a role. \"That's something no human being experienced 200 years ago,\" Ogino said. Lights allow us to work and socialize at all hours, impacting how our body clocks regulate hormones and metabolism.</p>, <p>Dr. Heinz-Josef Lenz, co-lead of the gastrointestinal cancer program at the University of Southern California cancer center, is also studying how the environment may be damaging our DNA in ways we don't yet understand.</p>, <p>His data so far suggests the trend of more younger folks developing colon cancer isn't genetic, but our genes may affect how we respond to our exposures — the processed food we eat, the antibiotics we take, and the polluted air we breathe.</p>, <p>\"When you are 16 years old or 20 years old, you cannot blame it on diet or exercise or obesity — it's just too short,\" he said. \"We're just scratching the surface on better understanding the impact of the parents, particularly in the young onset: was their exposure part of it, or not?\"</p>, <p>Here are five things we're learning:</p>, <p>We can't separate gut health from our internal clock.</p>, <p>Gut bacteria help regulate sleep, which cuts cancer risk.</p>, <p>Emerging evidence suggests that disrupting the circadian rhythm creates problems in the gut that can contribute to colon cancer, according to <a data-analytics-product-module=\"body_link\" href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ado1458\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">studies in mice</a> and <a data-analytics-product-module=\"body_link\" href=\"https://jhoonline.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13045-022-01238-y\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">data in humans</a>. Our sleep can be derailed by late schedules and artificial light from our homes and phones, which may be one factor in rising colon cancer cases.</p>, <p>Increasingly, researchers are finding evidence that microplastics play a negative role in fertility.</p>, <p>They can also be pro-inflammatory, driving diseases like cancer and obesity, hurting lungs, and possibly <a data-analytics-product-module=\"body_link\" href=\"https://ysph.yale.edu/news-article/yale-study-forever-chemicals-promote-cancer-cell-migration/\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\">helping cancer </a>to thrive in the body.</p>, <p>A new evidence <a data-analytics-product-module=\"body_link\" href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.3c09524\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">roundup</a> from researchers at <a data-analytics-product-module=\"body_link\" href=\"https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2024/12/429161/microplastics-air-may-be-leading-lung-and-colon-cancers\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\">UCSF</a> analyzed 22 studies that compared microplastic exposure to health problems in mice and people, and found that all of them showed some harm.</p>, <p>\"We basically saw this continuous effect that the more you get exposed to it, so in our environment, the more it gets produced, the greater the health harm,\" Nicholas Chartres, one of the study's authors and a former head of the science and policy team at UCSF's program on reproductive health and the environment, told BI.</p>, <p>Chartres says the time is now to act to reduce our microplastic exposure, and it must be done at a policy level. At home, Chartres runs around the house throwing out his kids' plastic toys, but he knows he's playing a losing game of environmental whack-a-mole.</p>, <p>\"We don't need to have specific quantification of the level of harm, there's enough here to show that they're certainly contributing,\" he said.</p>, <p>Lenz is conducting research that aims to unravel why so many Hispanic patients in Southern California seem to be especially at risk of developing early colon cancer.</p>, <p>His team is studying cancer patients' blood, DNA damage, lifestyles, and ZIP codes to pinpoint where their exposure risks might be coming from, whether it be overuse of antibiotics, pollution that families are exposed to, or something else.</p>, <p>\"It could be an epigenetic event, not only from the patient itself but from the family, from the parents and their exposure,\" he said. \"Epigenetics can be influenced by lifestyle and by exposure to chemicals, or whatever it is that will actually react.\"</p>, <p>It is well established that antibiotics disrupt the gut microbiome, killing off some beneficial bacteria. And humans aren't the only antibiotic consumers.</p>, <p>Most of the antibiotics (73%) in use worldwide are for <a class=\"\" data-analytics-product-module=\"body_link\" href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7766021/#B9-antibiotics-09-00918\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\">meat production</a>, recent research suggests. Some meat advertised as <a data-analytics-product-module=\"body_link\" href=\"https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2024/08/28/usda-releases-updated-guideline-strengthen-substantiation-animal-raising-and-environment-related\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\">antibiotic-free</a> has failed independent testing.</p>, <p>Red meat consumption ups a person's colon cancer risk, and so does antibiotic use, but these two factors aren't necessarily separate.</p>, <p>Newborns are exposed to trillions of their mother's microbes as they travel through the birth canal, giving an infant's microbiome an initial boost. Kids who are delivered through the abdomen via cesarean section don't get those same health benefits.</p>, <p>Recent <a data-analytics-product-module=\"body_link\" href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2804228\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">research from Sweden</a> suggests girls who are born via c-section have a higher risk of developing young colon cancer than those born vaginally.</p>, <p>In 2024, a group of international researchers mapped 1.6 million cells in the gut to create the most comprehensive picture to date — the \"<a data-analytics-product-module=\"body_link\" href=\"https://www.gutcellatlas.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">gut atlas</a>.\"</p>, <p>\"It's rare that any one study squeezes out all the relevant biological insights,\" Ivan Vujkovic-Cvijin, a professor of medicine at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, who was not involved in the study, told Business Insider.</p>, <p>\"By identifying which components of tissue function are dysregulated in disease, the scientific community can design drugs to restore those functions,\" he said.</p>, <p>There's more to come. Multiple big, well-funded multinational studies are underway, including a US-UK collaboration that's giving out interdisciplinary cancer grants to teams around the world. The studies are expected to release results this year and next.</p>, <p>Until we know better what's going on, researchers and clinicians say there are two steps you can take to reduce colon cancer risk.</p>, <p>First, control what you can control.</p>, <p>\"Let's focus on the stuff we can change,\" Dr. Cassandra Fritz, a gastroenterologist and colon cancer researcher at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, tells her patients.</p>, <p>That means no smoking, regular exercise, less alcohol, reducing your intake of ultra-processed snacks and processed meats, and no sugary beverages — factors directly linked with colon cancer risk. You could also consider <a class=\"\" data-analytics-product-module=\"body_link\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/microplastic-reduce-exposure-consumption-at-home-2024-10\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\">microwaving food in glass</a> or ceramic instead of plastic.</p>, <p>Second, know the signs of colon cancer and do not be complacent about them. Many young cases are diagnosed too late, making treatment complicated.</p>, <p>These four symptoms can occur up to 18 months before a colon cancer diagnosis:</p>, <p>Don't fear the process of getting checked, experts told BI. Anyone dealing with these persistent symptoms can ask their doctor for a fecal immunochemical test (FIT) that is noninvasive and costs just a few dollars.</p>, <p>\"If there are symptoms which could be associated with colon cancer, make sure you get the screening and don't just accept that they're saying 'It's unlikely' or 'I've never seen it,'\" Lenz said.</p>, <p>When it's spotted early, <a data-analytics-product-module=\"body_link\" href=\"https://www3.mdanderson.org/app/medcalc/index.cfm?pagename=coloncancer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">colon cancer is a very survivable disease</a>.</p>, <p>Jump to</p>]\n",

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?Join todayClimateThe far right is going … green?Something strange is happening inside the environmental movement.by  Benji JonesUpdated Feb 4, 2025, 5:17 PM UTCFacebookLink Ben Hickey for VoxBenji Jones is an environmental correspondent at Vox, covering biodiversity loss and climate change. Before joining Vox, he was a senior energy reporter at Business Insider. Benji previously worked as a wildlife researcher.“In my view, climate change is real and it is an existential threat.” “My inclination is to take dams down.”“The toxic chemicals that pollute our air, our water, our soils end up in our own bodies. They ruin our health in the same way that they ruin nature.”Those might sound like comments from a pretty typical environmentalist: a liberal Democrat who probably reveres the outdoors and enjoys hiking, thinks about their carbon footprint, and tries to eat less meat. Instead, they were spoken by a key member of President Donald Trump’s coalition: Robert F. Kennedy Jr.In recent years, when he’s appeared on podcasts and campaign ads, Kennedy — who’s on track to become the secretary of Health and Human Services — often brought up environmental concerns, like how pesticides are poisoning Americans, and sang the virtues of healthy soil. A Senate panel voted on Tuesday to advance Kennedy’s nomination to the full Senate. A vote is expected in the coming days.“I’m an environmentalist,” he told right-wing commentator Ben Shapiro last April. Kennedy has the credentials. He spent more than two decades working as an environmental attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), a mainstream green group, and later helped found the Waterkeeper Alliance, a nonprofit that advocates for clean water. He fought polluters including the coal industry, chemical companies, and the US Navy.That’s what makes his current political alignment so surprising: Kennedy is now firmly enmeshed in the far right, and part of Team Trump — “the single worst environmental president our country has ever had,” according to some of Kennedy’s former colleagues. Trump, a climate-science skeptic, rolled back more than 100 environmental rules during his first term. And on his first day in office, he signed a raft of executive orders to boost oil and gas production and roll back environmental safeguards.RFK Jr. visits the Capitol on December 18, 2024, to meet with West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito. J. Scott Applewhite/Associated PressKennedy was a longtime Democrat, and his migration to the far right has shocked many of those who have known him. But he’s not alone in this journey. It’s part of a much broader shift in the environmental movement. For decades, most mainstream green advocacy groups and top environmental scientists have been largely aligned with Democratic policies and leaders. Now, however, many people who are advocating for conservation, including clean water, air, and soil, have fallen into the far right and voted Trump into power. It’s not uncommon to hear right-wing influencers talk about regenerative agriculture or Kennedy supporters raising concerns about environmental pollutants. While it’s not clear how much power they will ultimately wield in the Trump administration, they represent a new and increasingly visible right-wing environmentalism — or what sociologist Holly Jean Buck has called para-environmentalism.RelatedThe slippery appeal of RFK Jr.’s Make America Healthy Again movement“Kennedy’s rightward trajectory and new position within the MAGA movement are the latest indication that ideas that were once a core part of environmentalism are veering in a strange direction,” Buck, an associate professor at the University of Buffalo, wrote in Compact magazine in November. “Call it para-environmentalism. Like other para-phenomena, such as paramilitaries or the paranormal, para-environmentalism exists outside of the realm of official institutions and structures — at least for now.”Across even the farthest stretches of the political spectrum are shared environmental goals: healthier land and healthier people. Everyone wants that. What stands in the way of a more unified environmental movement is that different political blocs have wildly different approaches to making the planet healthier. People on the far-right tend to distrust institutions including science agencies and big green groups, which form the backbone of the mainstream environmental movement. Members of this group also oppose action that centers on carbon and climate change; their concerns are more local, whether about water quality or immigration and grocery prices.This leaves the modern green movement in a tough spot as it stares down four more years under Trump.

In fact, the movement to protect wildlife was born from the minds and actions of GOP leaders. More than a century ago, elite, Republican hunters — most famously, Teddy Roosevelt — witnessed the decline of charismatic species like bison and used their power to protect them. They supported, and in some cases helped create, environmental institutions like the national parks system.That legacy of conservation lives on to an extent in the modern Republican Party. The waning number of hunters and anglers of today still lean more conservative, partly due to their stance on gun rights. And by and large, they back mainstream conservation policies, such as protecting public access to federal land, said Aaron Weiss, deputy director at the Center for Western Priorities, a group that advocates for public lands. There’s also a crop of moderate conservatives, including many youth, who worry about climate change and support conservation and clean energy.This new brand of far-right environmentalism that Kennedy embodies is something different. My reporting, including more than a dozen interviews with sociologists, conservative influencers, and mainstream environmentalists, identified two loose and partly overlapping strains. One consists of those who rail against environmental toxins as part of Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) coalition. Another comprises back-to-the-land libertarians who see salvation in growing one’s own food, maintaining healthy soil, and embracing self-sufficiency.A controlled burn released a dark plume of smoke over East Palestine, Ohio, following the Norfolk Southern train derailment in 2023. Gene J. Puskar/Associated PressMAHA environmentalism is rooted in a fear that we’re all being poisoned — that pesticides, food additives, seed oils, and chemicals in the air are the root of chronic illness in America. The perpetrators, they claim, are Big Agriculture, Big Pharma, and other big corporations. A core belief is that industries have infiltrated federal agencies like the Food and Drug Administration that should be keeping Americans safe. Many of the most outspoken MAHA figures promote and sell alternatives to conventional foods and health care, such as nutritional supplements. (MAHA figures including Kennedy also frequently assert that vaccines are unsafe and cause autism. Neither claims are supported by decades of scientific research.)RelatedThe stunning success of vaccines in America, in one chartI recently spoke with Reinette Senum, a blogger and former mayor of Nevada City, California, who has spoken out against what she says are covert efforts to manipulate the atmosphere. Senum, who identifies as MAHA, describes herself as a former environmentalist and “recovering climate change believer.”A number of experiences fueled her distrust of climate science. More than a decade ago, when Senum worked for a building-efficiency organization in California, she raised questions about whether retrofitting buildings is so resource-intensive that it actually offsets the climate benefits, she said. The managing director of the organization, known then as the California Building Performance Contractors Association, told her that those calculations didn’t exist, she said. “I believed in alternative energy, and I realized it was a lie,” Senum said. Senum later had a smart meter installed in her home. Shortly after, she said, she started having trouble sleeping and became extremely sensitive to sound — symptoms that she attributes to the smart meter. (Smart meters, as well as 5G and GMO foods, are all dubious for many in the MAHA movement, some of whom happen to reside in my hometown of Fairfield, Iowa.)Trump visits Valdosta, Georgia, on September 30, 2024, after it was hit by Hurricane Helene. Michael M. Santiago/Getty ImagesLike many other MAHA followers, Senum said she is worried about the environment, and the dark forces that pollute it, whether or not they’re visible. And like some mainstream environmental organizations, she’s fighting against geo-engineering, large-scale modifications to the planet’s climate to limit warming, a field that is still largely experimental. The problem with left-wing green groups, Senum said, is that they’ve become too fixated on the climate change “boondoggle” and have ignored what people are actually concerned about.“Nobody talks about water quality,” she said of left-wing environmentalists. “They don’t talk about air quality. They don’t talk about pollution. They don’t talk about heavy metals in the air. Or GMOs. The left environmental movement literally got infiltrated and usurped by climate change. They’re so hyperfocused on that that they’re no longer focusing on the environment.”A representative from Kennedy’s team told Vox that Kennedy was unavailable for an interview, in December. The representative did not respond to subsequent emails, including a detailed request for comment.The other, overlapping strand of far-right environmentalism is more focused on land and soil. A number of influential figures, including US Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and farmer Joel Salatin, advocate for locally grown food and farms that are free from the influence of Big Government and Big Business. Pastoral libertarians, as you might call them, glorify an earlier time before industrial agriculture, and are obsessed with the purity of what we eat and drink. “What we are witnessing in the growing prominence of far-right environmentalism of recent years is a revival of an older kind of ecological and political thinking, a traditional attachment to home, to soil, to blood,” Leigh Phillips wrote in Noema. Cattle on a ranch that practices regenerative agriculture in Cimarron, New Mexico. Mario Tama/Getty ImagesMuch of the far right has embraced “regenerative agriculture” — a squishy term that broadly refers to farming practices that are meant to regenerate, or improve, the health of land rather than degrade it. These practices include planting cover crops that can improve soil health and avoiding chemicals that degrade it. Regenerative agriculture has caught on among far-right figures likely because it enables a person to have a more self-sufficient farm, requiring fewer inputs, such as pesticides made by big companies and subsidized by the federal government. Advocates of the practice say it also produces more nutritious food.RelatedHow the most powerful environmental groups help greenwash Big Meat’s climate impact“Regenerative agriculture, it’s the truth,” said RC Carter, a rancher in Wyoming who sells what he calls nutrient-dense beef. He didn’t vote in the recent presidential election, doesn’t trust most Democratic or Republican leaders, and resists being clumped into any one group. “The only way you can get nutrient-dense food is if it comes from healthy soils,” Carter told me.“People are so confused and so lost, and if you’re eating healthy food, that is a foundational piece to having clear thoughts.”What unifies this new brand of environmentalismThe most apparent trait that unites these far-right perspectives is distrust — of the government, of large scientific organizations, of big corporations. Distrust is so potent that even quality information produced by these institutions, whether on vaccine safety or climate change, doesn’t break through and alter beliefs. I saw this firsthand in East Palestine, Ohio, following the train derailment in early 2023. There were legitimate criticisms of the government response, but government data on air and water quality had little bearing on whether residents, the majority of whom voted for Trump in 2020 and 2024, felt safe.RelatedWhat the Ohio train derailment teaches us about poisoning public trustBut there’s another, more opaque thread among right-wing environmental beliefs, according to Jesse Bryant, a sociologist at Yale University: a yearning for a religious or pseudo-religious purity. The idea here is that our ecosystems, our soils, our bodies, and our minds are polluted — whether by pesticides or by liberal ideas — and that makes it harder to access God, or spiritual enlightenment. “It’s very clear having spent a lot of time in far-right online spaces that purity and pollution binaries drive a lot of [right-wing] ideologizing,” said Bryant, who studies environmental perspectives in far-right communities. This perspective likely stems from Christian culture and beliefs, a powerful force in right-wing politics. According to Christian teachings, human bodies are made in God’s image, and so they are naturally pure. Pollution, or impurity, is akin to sin. And sin can weaken our relationship with God. Similarly, from a New Age spiritual perspective — more common among members of the MAHA coalition — loading our bodies with impurities, which could include pesticide-ridden foods, is considered an impediment to reaching spiritual enlightenment.That these ideas influence political views are supported by a 2012 study published in Psychological Science. It found that people who identify as conservatives tend to be less concerned about the environment than those who identify as liberal, yet they are motivated to protect nature with messaging around purity. “We found that reframing pro-environmental rhetoric in terms of purity, a moral value resonating primarily among conservatives, largely eliminated the difference between liberals’ and conservatives’ environmental attitudes,” the authors wrote. In a conversation with right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson in August, Kennedy said, “the reason that we protect the environment is because there’s a spiritual connection.” “When we destroy nature,” Kennedy said, “we diminish our capacity to sense the divine, to understand who God is and what our own potential is and duties are as human beings.”Ben Hickey for VoxIdeas around purity and nature have also been used over the years to justify racism and abuse. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the US government, in the name of protecting nature, forcefully removed Indigenous people from their lands to establish national parks. The very definition of “wilderness” areas promoted the idea that an unpeopled, wild landscape was pristine, pure, and unspoiled, even though Indigenous people lived on such lands for tens of thousands of years. These racist perspectives — that people, and especially brown people, are an impediment to achieving the ideal nature — were popular even among mainstream environmentalists in the 20th century. And they’ve lingered. Trump’s racist remarks about immigrants, such as saying in 2023 that “illegal immigration is poisoning the blood of our nation,” is merely another iteration of a purity-pollution dichotomy that has long been present among environmentalists.Seeds of truthMany of the environmental concerns raised by members of the far right, MAHA and MAGA alike, are rooted in fact. Pesticides can be dangerous, especially to farmworkers and native insects, including bees. Studies in rigorous journals have linked pesticide exposure to, for example, increased mortality in US adults, ADHD in children, and Alzheimer’s disease. Earlier this month, a study linked exposure to the herbicide Glyphosate to a reduction in birthweight.RelatedThe astonishing link between bats and the deaths of human babiesIndustrial farming has utterly devastated native ecosystems across the Midwest and completely removed at least a quarter of the topsoil in the Corn Belt. Compared to that loss, regenerative agriculture — no matter how you define it — is a more sustainable option.A tractor sprays pesticides on a farm in Centreville, Maryland, on April 25, 2022. JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty ImagesMore than a third of Americans have at least one major chronic disease, such as diabetes, especially people who are living in the Southeast. And the prevalence of these illnesses is increasing, in part, because of poor nutrition. Big corporations and billionaires do influence US policy and government agencies, and it’s a problem. Federal and state lobbyists spent more than $46 billion between 2015 and 2023, according to OpenSecrets.“Their concerns are grounded in real things,” said Buck, the University of Buffalo sociologist and author of After Geoengineering: Climate Tragedy, Repair, and Restoration and Ending Fossil Fuels: Why Net Zero Is Not Enough.But although the far right is pointing out legitimate problems — which concern mainstream environmentalists, too — supporting Trump and deregulation is likely only going to make them worse.For example, if this new environmental coalition wants to solve the problem of corporate influence, they’re going to run into challenges: In Trump’s first two years in office, his administration “enabled unprecedented corporate capture of federal regulatory agencies,” according to a 2019 report. The report outlines how, for example, the National Association of Manufacturers, a trade association, sent his administration a wish list of 132 regulations to act on, and his government followed through on the bulk of them. In his first term, Trump was incredibly friendly to polluters. His administration rolled back more than 100 environmental rules, including those meant to curb toxic air pollutants, limit pesticide exposure, and protect streams from coal mining debris — problems caused largely by big companies. Under his administration, some EPA scientists say they were pressured to downplay the risks of new chemicals, according to reporting by ProPublica. Trump has already indicated that his new administration will be similarly favorable to Big Business and billionaires. In a December post on his platform Truth Social, he said, “any person or company investing one billion dollars, or more, in the United States of America, will receive fully expedited approvals and permits, including, but in no way limited to, all environmental approvals.” The process for getting project approvals is partly meant to ensure they don’t harm US citizens or sensitive ecosystems. Trump, meanwhile, has already named former chemical industry executives to top posts at the Environmental Protection Agency. Elon Musk at Trump’s campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on October 5, 2024. JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty ImagesMeanwhile, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk — the world’s richest man, who helped propel Trump to victory — has shown his ability to influence high-stakes government decision-making. Musk and other tech titans were key players in Trump’s transition team, involved in hiring decisions for his incoming administration, the New York Times reported in December. Musk, along with Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg — who are collectively worth close to $1 trillion — attended Trump’s inauguration, and were seated in front of the president’s Cabinet picks.More broadly, a push to deregulate — which Trump and his base widely support — is at odds with efforts to curtail harmful chemicals and our exposure to them. Regulations are designed to prevent harmful substances from entering our soil, water, and air. This doesn’t mean they’re working perfectly or doing enough or easy to follow, but pollution would likely be worse with fewer of those rules in place. “Regulations are about setting a level playing field … so that business can go out and do its job and earn profits, but make sure that you don’t have bad actors out there skewing the playing field by harming folks because it benefits their bottom line,” said Matthew Tejada, senior vice president of environmental health at NRDC. Without regulations, said Tejada, a former EPA senior staffer, “you get a race to the bottom,” meaning the worst actors — the companies least focused on, say, reducing air pollution — set the standard for other companies.Regulatory experts I spoke to were clear that if RFK Jr. wants to crack down on food dyes and pesticides, he would need to pursue new regulations and not tear existing ones down. His ability to do that will be limited, even if he’s confirmed to lead HHS.“I don’t think he’s going to beat Big Food,” said Ken Cook, president and cofounder of Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization focused on ridding environmental toxins from food and water. “He can’t walk down the hall to FDA and say, ‘Hey, all these food additives are banned in Europe so we’re going to ban them here.’ … Industry is going to push back and they’re probably going to win.” This points to an obvious rift in the new administration and the modern Republican Party: Trump has curried the favor of billionaires and deregulatory crusaders and yet members of his coalition say they want to reign in corporate influence and pollution. But although those attitudes are at odds, it might not matter. Most people support Trump not because of his stance on environmental issues but because of his rhetoric around immigration and the economy. It’s also not clear how large or powerful this new band of right-wing environmentalists really is, and whether they can really influence the administration. Some Trump administration appointments already seem to be in direct tension with the MAHA coalition. Fire engulfs a home in the Altadena area of Los Angeles on January 8. Research shows that climate change can worsen wildfires. Josh Edelson/AFP via Getty ImagesJust as support for Trump and deregulation is at odds with a desire for a healthy environment, so is an allergy to climate action.Many MAHA and MAGA people with environmental concerns tend to criticize clean energy and downplay the impacts of the oil and gas industry. Part of that belief stems from a rejection of globalization and hyper growth — a more traditional conservative ideology. A self-sufficient, pastoral lifestyle doesn’t mesh with a highly modern, massive solar farm that centralizes energy production (let alone the huge, power-hungry data centers that Trump’s new friends in the tech industry demand to support the growth of artificial intelligence).These beliefs are reinforced by misinformation. This includes claims that lifetime carbon emissions of EVs are comparable or higher to combustion cars. (They’re not.) Or that clean energy sources pollute the environment more than fossil fuels. (They don’t.) Or that offshore wind turbines are killing whales. (There’s no scientific evidence to suggest that.)“They’re all made in China and when they explode — which one did off of Nantucket a month ago — they put shards into the water so you can’t swim without getting cut,” Kennedy said of offshore wind turbines on a podcast in September. (Last summer, blades of the turbine, which was manufactured by an American company, folded over and broke off into the ocean.) “They’re killing the whales. The environmental movement doesn’t care. They built these and they are destroying the whale populations and everybody knows it.”This isn’t correct. The reality is that oil, gas, and coal have been federally subsidized for hundreds of years. Their staying power is in part the result of big government. Even if you ignore the impacts of climate change, these fuels have been definitively tied to air pollution including nitrous oxides, carbon monoxide, and ozone, compounds widely known to harm human health. A peer-reviewed study published in the journal Environmental Research in 2021 attributed more than 10 million premature deaths each year, globally, to air pollution from burning fossil fuels. It’s not surprising that people who live near petrochemical plants have higher rates of cancer. (That doesn’t mean “clean energy” sources are pollution-free — they’re definitely not. But comparatively, they are a heck of a lot safer.)Then of course there are the impacts of rising temperatures, which are increasingly hard to ignore. The planet is about 1.3 degrees Celsius warmer today than it was in the late 1800s. Yes, there have been hotter periods in Earth’s past, but not during modern civilization — and the warming has never happened this fast.Human populations and ecosystems are struggling to keep up with the rate of change. In the Florida Keys, for example, extreme ocean temperatures have helped wipe out coral reefs, a critical structure for dampening waves that flood coastal communities during hurricanes. Healthy coral cover in the Keys has declined by at least 90 percent in the last half century. Monroe County, which encompasses the Florida Keys, overwhelmingly supported Trump in the past election.RelatedAmerica’s most iconic coral reef is dying. Only one thing will save it.Against this backdrop, Trump has put “drill, baby, drill” at the center of his agenda. On his first day in office, he signed several executive orders intended to accelerate fossil fuel production. These include trying to open up vast stretches of Alaskan wilderness to drilling and logging, and eliminating efforts to protect poor communities from pollution.Chris Wright is sworn in during his Senate confirmation hearing on January 15. Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesA protester at Wright’s confirmation hearing. Kayla Bartkowski/Getty ImagesTrump’s pick to run the Department of Energy is also telling, though unsurprising. Chris Wright is the founder, CEO, and chair of the board of Liberty Energy, one of the nation’s largest fracking services companies. In a video on LinkedIn in 2023, he said, “there is no climate crisis, and we’re not in the midst of an energy transition, either.”What’s next for the environmental movement?Trump is back in the White House, and many environmental problems — wildfires, hurricanes, habitat loss — are worse today than ever before. Where does the environmental movement go from here?Fortunately, there is common ground between far-right and mainstream environmentalists: a desire for clean air, water, and soil, and accountability for big corporations that negatively impact the environment. Among these disparate factions, polluting companies are a common enemy, even though the Republican Party has traditionally, and under Trump, favored polluters. “We have far more in common than we don’t,” said Ben Jealous, the executive director of the Sierra Club, one of the nation’s oldest and largest environmental organizations. “When you hear Americans of any political stripe express concern about pesticides, express a desire for clean air, clean water, and healthy food, express a preference for anything related to reviving small farms … what that affirms for me is that our issues, our [environmental] agenda, is more popular than either party.”The Sierra Club and other big green groups acknowledge that they need to do a better job at talking about these common concerns. “We can’t talk about gigatons of carbon equivalents,” said Tejada of the NRDC. “Like nobody knows or cares. We can talk about the fact, though, that a storm hit West North Carolina a couple months ago that left $60 billion worth of damage that nobody knows how to pay for.”Ben Jealous, executive director of the Sierra Club, speaks at a climate protest in Washington, DC, on March 21, 2023. Matt McClain/Washington Post via Getty ImagesAs Jealous put it, the problem with the environmental movement “is not what we say, it’s literally how we say it.”Green groups could adjust their messaging, and perhaps get more of the right behind their cause. This may work in local fights — to protect a city park, for example, or clean up a stream. It is not, however, in the public’s interest to abandon efforts to tackle climate change; lowering carbon and expanding clean energy are integral to those efforts. Plus, ditching carbon from the green vocabulary won’t suddenly dissolve political divides. There are much bigger hurdles to building a more unified environmental movement. Common among the far right is what Whitney Phillips, a media studies researcher and co-author of a forthcoming book on anti-liberalism, calls anti-liberal demonology: the idea that liberals, a group that is not clearly defined, are an evil force that is polluting the “real America.” Most mainstream green organizations, Democratic policymakers, and scientists — again, pillars of the modern environmental movement — are seen as liberal and thus deeply mistrusted. To the far right, they are inextricably linked to the very pollutants, the impurities, that they’re trying to get rid of (even though these groups are arguably doing more than any other to clean up pollution).Without resolving these deeply entrenched trust issues, it’s unlikely that far right and mainstream environmental leaders will be fighting these problems together. “If you’re trying to work with people who are on the left, but you hate people on the left,” Phillips said, “how the fuck is that supposed to work?”Umair Irfan contributed reporting.Update, February 4, 2025, 12:15 pm: This story was originally published on January 28.

Like other para-phenomena, such as paramilitaries or the paranormal, para-environmentalism exists outside of the realm of official institutions and structures — at least for now.”</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Across even the farthest stretches of the political spectrum are shared environmental goals: healthier land and healthier people. Everyone wants that. What stands in the way of a more unified environmental movement is that different political blocs have wildly different approaches to making the planet healthier. People on the far-right tend to <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/06/24/public-trust-in-government-1958-2024/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">distrust institutions</a> including science agencies and big green groups, which form the backbone of the mainstream environmental movement. Members of this group also oppose action that centers on carbon and climate change; their concerns are more local, whether about water quality or immigration and grocery prices.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">This leaves the modern green movement in a tough spot as it stares down four more years under Trump. How can its leaders work with a coalition of people who see them, the mainstream, as part of the problem — and should they? </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst6\">Do you have feedback or a tip to share?

In fact, the movement to protect wildlife was born from the minds and actions of GOP leaders. More than a century ago, elite, Republican hunters — most famously, Teddy Roosevelt — witnessed the decline of charismatic species like bison and used their power to protect them. They supported, and in some cases helped create, environmental institutions like the national parks system.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">That legacy of conservation lives on to an extent in the modern Republican Party. The <a href=\"https://www.fws.gov/story/2024-09/report-offers-snapshot-hunters-and-anglers-us\">waning number of hunters and anglers</a> of today still lean more conservative, partly due to their stance on gun rights. And by and large, they back mainstream conservation policies, such as protecting public access to federal land, said <a href=\"https://westernpriorities.org/about/\">Aaron Weiss</a>, deputy director at the Center for Western Priorities, a group that advocates for public lands. There’s also a crop of <a href=\"https://republicen.org/\">moderate conservatives</a>, <a href=\"https://acc.eco/\">including many youth</a>, who <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/its-not-easy-being-a-green-conservative/id1346207297?i=1000659671263\">worry about climate change</a> and support conservation and clean energy.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">This new brand of far-right environmentalism that Kennedy embodies is something different. My reporting, including more than a dozen interviews with sociologists, conservative influencers, and mainstream environmentalists, identified two loose and partly overlapping strains. One consists of those who rail against environmental toxins as part of <a href=\"/policy/390309/maha-rfk-make-america-healthy-again-slippery\">Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) coalition</a>. Another comprises back-to-the-land libertarians who see salvation in growing one’s own food, maintaining healthy soil, and embracing self-sufficiency.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">MAHA environmentalism is rooted in a fear that we’re all being poisoned — that pesticides, food additives, seed oils, and chemicals in the air are the root of chronic illness in America. The perpetrators, they claim, are Big Agriculture, Big Pharma, and other big corporations. A core belief is that industries have infiltrated federal agencies like the Food and Drug Administration that should be keeping Americans safe. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Many of the most outspoken <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/what-is-maha-health-wellness-movement-rfk-jr-policies.html#wellness-to-maha\">MAHA figures promote and sell alternatives</a> to conventional foods and health care, such as nutritional supplements. (MAHA figures including Kennedy also <a href=\"https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/fact-checking-presidential-candidate-robert-f-kennedy-jr-on-vaccines-autism-and-covid-19/\">frequently assert that vaccines are unsafe</a> and cause autism. Neither claims are supported by decades of scientific research.)</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">I recently spoke with Reinette Senum, a blogger and former mayor of Nevada City, California, who has <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/geoengineering-101-w-reinette-senum-ep378/id1491384824?i=1000678888853\">spoken out</a> against what she says are <a href=\"https://www.saveourskies.org/about\">covert efforts to manipulate the atmosphere</a>. Senum, who identifies as MAHA, describes herself as a former environmentalist and “recovering climate change believer.”</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">A number of experiences fueled her distrust of climate science. More than a decade ago, when Senum worked for a building-efficiency organization in California, she raised questions about whether retrofitting buildings is so resource-intensive that it actually offsets the climate benefits, she said. The managing director of the organization, known then as the California Building Performance Contractors Association, told her that those calculations didn’t exist, she said. “I believed in alternative energy, and I realized it was a lie,” Senum said. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Senum later had a smart meter installed in her home. Shortly after, she said, she started having trouble sleeping and became extremely sensitive to sound — symptoms that she attributes to the smart meter. (Smart meters, as well as 5G and GMO foods, are all dubious for many in the MAHA movement, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/a-small-towns-battle-against-smart-meters-and-a-utility-2020-5\">some of whom happen to reside in my hometown of Fairfield, Iowa</a>.)</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Like many other MAHA followers, Senum said she is worried about the environment, and the dark forces that pollute it, whether or not they’re visible. And like some mainstream environmental organizations, she’s fighting against geo-engineering, large-scale modifications to the planet’s climate to limit warming, a field that is still largely experimental. The problem with left-wing green groups, Senum said, is that they’ve become too fixated on the climate change “boondoggle” and have ignored what people are actually concerned about.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">“Nobody talks about water quality,” she said of left-wing environmentalists. “They don’t talk about air quality. They don’t talk about pollution. They don’t talk about heavy metals in the air. Or GMOs. The left environmental movement literally got infiltrated and usurped by climate change. They’re so hyperfocused on that that they’re no longer focusing on the environment.”</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">A representative from Kennedy’s team told Vox that Kennedy was unavailable for an interview, in December. The representative did not respond to subsequent emails, including a detailed request for comment.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">The other, overlapping strand of far-right environmentalism is more focused on land and soil. A number of influential figures, including US Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and farmer Joel Salatin, advocate for locally grown food and farms that are free from the influence of Big Government and Big Business. Pastoral libertarians, as you might call them, glorify an earlier time before industrial agriculture, and are obsessed with the purity of what we eat and drink. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">“What we are witnessing in the growing prominence of far-right environmentalism of recent years is a revival of an older kind of ecological and political thinking, a traditional attachment to home, to soil, to blood,” <a href=\"https://www.noemamag.com/brown-shirts-green-dreams/\">Leigh Phillips wrote in Noema</a>. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Much of the far right has embraced “regenerative agriculture” — a squishy term that broadly refers to farming practices that are meant to regenerate, or improve, the health of land rather than degrade it. These practices include planting cover crops that can improve soil health and avoiding chemicals that degrade it. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Regenerative agriculture has caught on among far-right figures likely because it enables a person to have a more self-sufficient farm, requiring fewer inputs, such as pesticides made by big companies and subsidized by the federal government. <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/our-food-is-killing-us-regenerative-farming-fixes-this/id1715910847?i=1000671194804\">Advocates of the practice say</a> it also <a href=\"https://www.regenerativefarmersofamerica.com/regenerative-farmers-of-america-blog/how-regenerative-agriculture-can-improve-the-nutritional-value-of-your-food\">produces more nutritious food</a>.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">“Regenerative agriculture, it’s the truth,” said RC Carter, a rancher in Wyoming who sells what he calls nutrient-dense beef. He didn’t vote in the recent presidential election, doesn’t trust most Democratic <em>or</em> Republican leaders, and resists being clumped into any one group. “The only way you can get nutrient-dense food is if it comes from healthy soils,” Carter told me.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">“People are so confused and so lost, and if you’re eating healthy food, that is a foundational piece to having clear thoughts.”</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">The most apparent trait that unites these far-right perspectives is distrust — of the government, of large scientific organizations, of big corporations. Distrust is so potent that even quality information produced by these institutions, whether on vaccine safety or climate change, doesn’t break through and alter beliefs. I <a href=\"https://www.regenerativefarmersofamerica.com/regenerative-farmers-of-america-blog/how-regenerative-agriculture-can-improve-the-nutritional-value-of-your-food\">saw this firsthand in East Palestine, Ohio</a>, following the train derailment in early 2023. There were <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/15/us/ohio-train-derailment-anxiety.html\">legitimate criticisms of the government response</a>, but government data on air and water quality had little bearing on whether residents, the majority of whom voted for Trump in 2020 and 2024, felt safe.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">But there’s another, more opaque thread among right-wing environmental beliefs, according to <a href=\"https://environment.yale.edu/directory/student/jesse-bryant\">Jesse Bryant</a>, a sociologist at Yale University: a yearning for a religious or pseudo-religious purity. The idea here is that our ecosystems, our soils, our bodies, and our minds are polluted — whether by pesticides or by liberal ideas — and that makes it harder to access God, or spiritual enlightenment. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">“It’s very clear having spent a lot of time in far-right online spaces that purity and pollution binaries drive a lot of [right-wing] ideologizing,” said Bryant, who studies <a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-soc-083023-035225\">environmental perspectives in far-right communities</a>. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">This perspective likely stems from Christian culture and beliefs, a powerful force in right-wing politics. According to Christian teachings, human bodies are made in God’s image, and so they are naturally pure. Pollution, or impurity, is akin to sin. And sin can weaken our relationship with God. Similarly, from a New Age spiritual perspective — more common among members of the MAHA coalition — loading our bodies with impurities, which could include pesticide-ridden foods, is considered an impediment to reaching spiritual enlightenment.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">That these ideas influence political views are supported by a <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797612449177\">2012 study published in <em>Psychological Science</em></a><em>. </em>It found that people who identify as conservatives tend to be less concerned about the environment than those who identify as liberal, yet they are motivated to protect nature with messaging around purity. “We found that reframing pro-environmental rhetoric in terms of purity, a moral value resonating primarily among conservatives, largely eliminated the difference between liberals’ and conservatives’ environmental attitudes,” the authors wrote. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">In a<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo7ZgOAQyJ0\"> conversation</a> with right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson in August, Kennedy said, “the reason that we protect the environment is because there’s a spiritual connection.” </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">“When we destroy nature,” Kennedy said, “we diminish our capacity to sense the divine, to understand who God is and what our own potential is and duties are as human beings.”</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Ideas around purity and nature have also been used over the years to justify racism and abuse. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the US government, in the name of protecting nature, forcefully removed Indigenous people from their lands to establish national parks. The very definition of “wilderness” areas promoted the idea that an unpeopled, wild landscape was pristine, pure, and unspoiled, even though <a href=\"https://www.hcn.org/issues/53-11/indigenous-affairs-archaeology-the-white-sands-discovery-only-confirms-what-indigenous-people-have-said-all-along/\">Indigenous people lived on such lands for tens of thousands of years</a>. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">These racist perspectives — that people, and especially brown people, are an impediment to achieving the ideal nature — were popular even among mainstream environmentalists in the 20th century. And they’ve <a href=\"https://www.noemamag.com/brown-shirts-green-dreams/\">lingered</a>. Trump’s racist remarks about immigrants, such as <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-says-immigrants-are-poisoning-blood-country-biden-campaign-liken-rcna130141\">saying in 2023</a> that “illegal immigration is poisoning the blood of our nation,” is merely another iteration of a purity-pollution dichotomy that has long been present among environmentalists.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Many of the environmental concerns raised by members of the far right, MAHA and MAGA alike, are rooted in fact. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\"><a href=\"https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-022-13057-4\">Pesticides can be dangerous</a>, especially to <a href=\"https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/EHP6334\">farmworkers</a> and native insects, <a href=\"/down-to-earth/2023/1/19/23552518/honey-bees-native-bees-decline\">including bees</a>.

The report outlines how, for example, the National Association of Manufacturers, a trade association, sent his administration a wish list of 132 regulations to act on, and his government followed through on the bulk of them. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">In his first term, Trump was incredibly friendly to polluters. His administration <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks-list.html\">rolled back more than 100 environmental rules</a>, including those meant to <a href=\"/energy-and-environment/2018/1/26/16936104/epa-trump-toxic-air-pollution\">curb toxic air pollutants</a>,<a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/523442-epa-limits-enforcement-pesticide-application-boundaries/\"> limit pesticide exposure</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/business/energy-environment/senate-coal-regulations.html\">protect streams from coal mining debris</a> — problems caused largely by big companies. Under his administration, some <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/epa-scientists-faced-retaliation-after-finding-harm-from-chemicals\">EPA scientists say they were pressured to downplay</a> the risks of new chemicals, according to reporting by ProPublica. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Trump has already indicated that his new administration will be similarly favorable to Big Business and billionaires. In a <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113630131209113398\">December post</a> on his platform Truth Social, he said, “any person or company investing one billion dollars, or more, in the United States of America, will receive fully expedited approvals and permits, including, but in no way limited to, all environmental approvals.” The process for getting project approvals is partly meant to ensure they don’t harm US citizens or sensitive ecosystems. Trump, meanwhile, has already named <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/climate/epa-chemical-industry-beck-dekleva.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare\">former chemical industry executives to top posts</a> at the Environmental Protection Agency. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Meanwhile, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk — the world’s richest man, who helped propel Trump to victory — has shown his ability to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/elon-musk-leads-charge-kill-spending-bill-meant-avert-government-shutd-rcna184779\">influence high-stakes government decision-making</a>. Musk and other <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/us/politics/trump-elon-musk-silicon-valley.html\">tech titans were key players in Trump’s transition team</a>, involved in hiring decisions for his incoming administration, the New York Times reported in December. Musk, along with Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg — who are collectively worth close to $1 trillion — <a href=\"/future-perfect/395646/trump-inauguration-broligarchs-musk-zuckerberg-bezos-thiel\">attended Trump’s inauguration</a>, and were seated in front of the president’s Cabinet picks.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">More broadly, a push to deregulate — which Trump and his base widely support — is at odds with efforts to curtail harmful chemicals and our exposure to them. Regulations are designed to prevent harmful substances from entering our soil, water, and air. This doesn’t mean they’re working perfectly or doing enough or easy to follow, but pollution would likely be worse with fewer of those rules in place. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">“Regulations are about setting a level playing field … so that business can go out and do its job and earn profits, but make sure that you don’t have bad actors out there skewing the playing field by harming folks because it benefits their bottom line,” said <a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/bio/matthew-tejada\">Matthew Tejada</a>, senior vice president of environmental health at NRDC. Without regulations, said Tejada, a former EPA senior staffer, “you get a race to the bottom,” meaning the worst actors — the companies least focused on, say, reducing air pollution — set the standard for other companies.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Regulatory experts I spoke to were clear that if RFK Jr. wants to crack down on food dyes and pesticides, he would need to pursue new regulations and not tear existing ones down. His ability to do that will be limited, even if he’s confirmed to lead HHS.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">“I don’t think he’s going to beat Big Food,” said Ken Cook, president and cofounder of Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization focused on ridding environmental toxins from food and water. “He can’t walk down the hall to FDA and say, ‘Hey, all these food additives are banned in Europe so we’re going to ban them here.’ … Industry is going to push back and they’re probably going to win.” </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">This points to an obvious rift in the new administration and the modern Republican Party: Trump has curried the favor of billionaires and deregulatory crusaders and yet members of his coalition say they want to reign in corporate influence and pollution. But although those attitudes are at odds, it might not matter. Most people support Trump not because of his stance on environmental issues but because of his rhetoric around immigration and the economy. It’s also not clear how large or powerful this new band of right-wing environmentalists really is, and whether they can really influence the administration. Some Trump administration appointments already seem to be in <a href=\"https://foodfix.co/what-trumps-usda-pick-brooke-rollins-thinks-about-food-and-nutrition/\">direct tension with the MAHA coalition</a>. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Just as support for Trump and deregulation is at odds with a desire for a healthy environment, so is an allergy to climate action.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Many MAHA and MAGA people with environmental concerns tend to criticize clean energy and downplay the impacts of the oil and gas industry. Part of that belief stems from a rejection of globalization and hyper growth — a more traditional conservative ideology. A self-sufficient, pastoral lifestyle doesn’t mesh with a highly modern, massive solar farm that centralizes energy production (let alone the huge, power-hungry data centers that Trump’s new friends in the tech industry <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-ai-openai-oracle-softbank-son-altman-ellison-be261f8a8ee07a0623d4170397348c41\">demand to support the growth of artificial intelligence</a>).</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">These beliefs are reinforced by misinformation. This includes claims that lifetime carbon emissions of EVs are comparable or higher to combustion cars. (<a href=\"https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/are-electric-vehicles-definitely-better-climate-gas-powered-cars\">They’re not</a>.) Or that clean energy sources pollute the environment more than fossil fuels. (<a href=\"https://emp.lbl.gov/news/new-journal-article-nature-energy\">They don’t</a>.) Or that offshore wind turbines are killing whales. (There’s <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/marine-life-distress/frequent-questions-offshore-wind-and-whales\">no scientific evidence</a> to suggest that.)</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">“They’re all made in China and when they explode — which one did off of Nantucket a month ago — they put shards into the water so you can’t swim without getting cut,” <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/484-the-great-partisan-shift-robert-f-kennedy-jr/id1184022695?i=1000670837945\">Kennedy said of offshore wind turbines</a> on a podcast in September. (Last summer, blades of the turbine, which was manufactured by an American company, <a href=\"https://www.capecodtimes.com/story/news/environment/2024/07/24/nantucket-select-board-turbine-blade-failure-vineyard-wind-cape-cod-marthas-vineyard-offshore-wind/74506581007/\">folded over and broke off into the ocean</a>.) “They’re killing the whales. The environmental movement doesn’t care. They built these and they are destroying the whale populations and everybody knows it.”</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">This isn’t correct. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">The reality is that <a href=\"https://www.eesi.org/papers/view/fact-sheet-proposals-to-reduce-fossil-fuel-subsidies-january-2024\">oil, gas, and coal have been federally subsidized</a> for <a href=\"https://cen.acs.org/articles/89/i51/Long-History-US-Energy-Subsidies.html?\">hundreds of years</a>. Their staying power is in part the result of big government. Even if you ignore the impacts of climate change, these fuels have been definitively tied to air pollution including nitrous oxides, carbon monoxide, and ozone, compounds widely known to harm human health. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">A peer-reviewed study published in the journal <em>Environmental Research </em>in 2021<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013935121000487\"> attributed more than 10 million premature deaths each year</a>, globally, to air pollution from burning fossil fuels. It’s not surprising that people who <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/welcome-to-cancer-alley-where-toxic-air-is-about-to-get-worse\">live near petrochemical plants</a> have higher rates of cancer. (That doesn’t mean “clean energy” sources are pollution-free — they’re definitely not. But comparatively, <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/safest-sources-of-energy#:~:text=The%20key%20insight%20would%20still,renewables%20are%20similarly%20safe%20alternatives.\">they are a heck of a lot safer</a>.)</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Then of course there are the impacts of rising temperatures, which are increasingly hard to ignore. The planet is about <a href=\"https://climate.copernicus.eu/climate-indicators/temperature\">1.3 degrees Celsius warmer today</a> than it was in the late 1800s. Yes, there have been hotter periods in Earth’s past, but not during modern civilization — and the warming has never happened this fast.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Human populations and ecosystems are struggling to keep up with the rate of change. In the Florida Keys, for example, extreme ocean temperatures have <a href=\"/climate/23868423/florida-coral-reef-bleaching-heat-wave-climate-change\">helped wipe out coral reefs</a>, a critical structure for <a href=\"/down-to-earth/23046997/hurricane-ian-coral-reefs-climate-change-hurricanes\">dampening waves that flood coastal communities</a> during hurricanes. Healthy coral cover in the Keys has declined by at least 90 percent in the last half century. Monroe County, which encompasses the Florida Keys, <a href=\"https://www.keyselections.org/Portals/Monroe/SummaryforReports_State_1.pdf\">overwhelmingly supported Trump</a> in the past election.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Against this backdrop, Trump has put “drill, baby, drill” at the center of his agenda. On his first day in office, he signed several executive orders intended to accelerate fossil fuel production. These include <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-alaskas-extraordinary-resource-potential/\">trying to open up vast stretches of Alaskan wilderness</a> to drilling and logging, and <a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/trump-scraps-clinton-era-environmental-justice-order/\">eliminating efforts to protect poor communities from pollution</a>.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Trump’s pick to run the Department of Energy is also telling, though unsurprising. Chris Wright is the founder, CEO, and chair of the board of <a href=\"https://libertyenergy.com/about/leadership/\">Liberty Energy</a>, one of the nation’s largest fracking services companies. In a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/chris-wright-b8370a17b_energysobriety-activity-7021514919787319298-xpzQ/\">video on LinkedIn in 2023</a>, he said, “there is no climate crisis, and we’re not in the midst of an energy transition, either.”</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Trump is back in the White House, and many environmental problems — wildfires, hurricanes, habitat loss — are worse today than ever before. Where does the environmental movement go from here?</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Fortunately, there is common ground between far-right and mainstream environmentalists: a desire for clean air, water, and soil, and accountability for big corporations that negatively impact the environment. Among these disparate factions, polluting companies are a common enemy, even though the Republican Party has traditionally, and under Trump, favored polluters. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">“We have far more in common than we don’t,” said <a href=\"https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/authors/ben-jealous\">Ben Jealous</a>, the executive director of the Sierra Club, one of the nation’s oldest and largest environmental organizations. “When you hear Americans of any political stripe express concern about pesticides, express a desire for clean air, clean water, and healthy food, express a preference for anything related to reviving small farms … what that affirms for me is that our issues, our [environmental] agenda, is more popular than either party.”</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">The Sierra Club and other big green groups acknowledge that they need to do a better job at talking about these common concerns. “We can’t talk about gigatons of carbon equivalents,” said Tejada of the NRDC. “Like nobody knows or cares. We can talk about the fact, though, that a storm hit West North Carolina a couple months ago that left $60 billion worth of damage that nobody knows how to pay for.”</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">As Jealous put it, the problem with the environmental movement “is not what we say, it’s literally how we say it.”</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Green groups could adjust their messaging, and perhaps get more of the right behind their cause. This may work in local fights — to protect a city park, for example, or clean up a stream. It is not, however, in the public’s interest to abandon efforts to tackle climate change; lowering carbon and expanding clean energy are integral to those efforts. Plus, ditching carbon from the green vocabulary won’t suddenly dissolve political divides. There are much bigger hurdles to building a more unified environmental movement. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Common among the far right is what <a href=\"https://journalism.uoregon.edu/directory/faculty-and-staff/all/wphilli2\">Whitney Phillips</a>, a media studies researcher and co-author of a forthcoming <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262552271/the-shadow-gospel/\">book on anti-liberalism</a>, calls anti-liberal demonology: the idea that liberals, a group that is not clearly defined, are an evil force that is polluting the “real America.” </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Most mainstream green organizations, Democratic policymakers, and scientists — again, pillars of the modern environmental movement — are seen as liberal and thus deeply mistrusted. To the far right, they are inextricably linked to the very pollutants, the impurities, that they’re trying to get rid of (even though these groups are arguably doing more than any other to clean up pollution).</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Without resolving these deeply entrenched trust issues, it’s unlikely that far right and mainstream environmental leaders will be fighting these problems together. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1\">“If you’re trying to work with people who are on the left, but you hate people on the left,” Phillips said, “how the fuck is that supposed to work?”</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\"><em>Umair Irfan contributed reporting.</em></p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\"><em><strong>Update, February 4, 2025, 12:15 pm: </strong>This story was originally published on January 28.

Enfin, pas partout… autour des zones de fortes activités industrielles. Il s’agit d’une neige de pollutionDe la neige s'est installée à proximité des institutions européennes depuis mardi... mais pas partout dans Strasbourg. Et cette neige est industrielle. Strasbourg le 22/01/2025 - G. Varela / 20 Minutes3789Thibaut GagnepainPublié le 22/01/2025 à 12h16 • Mis à jour le 23/01/2025 à 09h02L'essentielDe la neige industrielle ou de pollution est tombée de manière localisée à Strasbourg, notamment dans le quartier de La Robertsau, en raison de l’activité industrielle du port du Rhin.Ce phénomène s’explique par des conditions météorologiques particulières, comme l’explique Gabriel Chamoulaud de Météo-France. « Actuellement, un air froid est piégé en basse couche au sol, surplombé par un air doux. Cette stratification de l’atmosphère piège ainsi l’humidité et les polluants près du sol. »Un redoux est attendu dans les prochains jours, qui devrait faire disparaître cette neige atypique, décrite comme « bizarre » par une fleuriste locale.Pas un flocon ici et un bon centimètre quelques centaines de mètres plus loin. A Strasbourg ces derniers jours, la neige choisit ses quartiers. La Robertsau surtout, Neudorf un peu, voire la commune voisine d’Hoenheim… Mais pourquoi là et pas ailleurs ?« C’est localisé autour du port du Rhin où il y a une forte activité industrielle », éclaire Gabriel Chamoulaud, prévisionniste à l’antenne locale de Météo-France. Logique, ce n’est pas de la neige traditionnelle qui tombe mais une dite « industrielle », ou « de pollution ». Comme cela est déjà arrivé ailleurs en France, comme à Nantes ou Toulouse.« Pour qu’il y en ait, il faut d’abord des conditions anticycloniques très stables », détaille le météorologue conseil. « Actuellement, un air froid est piégé en basse couche au sol, surplombé par un air doux. Cette stratification de l’atmosphère piège ainsi l’humidité et les polluants près du sol. Ces derniers vont alors jouer le rôle de noyaux de condensation et la vapeur d’eau va s’accrocher à eux pour former des flocons. Toujours en faible quantité. »« Des flocons en forme d’aiguilles »Suffisamment pour recouvrir, depuis mardi matin, La Robertsau donc. Qui restait blanche ce mercredi. « C’est comme si on était en plein hiver. Tous les arbres sont recouverts et ça a du mal à fondre », appuie une fleuriste habituée à ce phénomène. « Je sais que c’est lié aux usines. Ce n’est pas naturel et on le voit à la neige, elle est bizarre. »« Les flocons ont des structures en forme d’aiguilles, non en branches ou en étoiles », confirme Gabriel Chamoulaud en indiquant qu’ils devraient vite disparaître. Un redoux est attendu dans les prochaines heures dans la région. « Il va arriver dans le nord de l’Alsace demain [jeudi] matin et à Strasbourg en cours de journée. On va changer de régime de temps, ce sera plus instable. »Notre dossier NeigeLes températures devraient nettement remonter au-dessus de 0 °C, après plusieurs jours dans le négatif. L’hiver 2024-2025 serait-il plus froid que les précédents ? « Par rapport aux normales de ces trente dernières années, on est légèrement au-dessus », relativise le spécialiste. « Le dernier hiver froid remonte à 2017. »À lire aussiTic tacC’est quoi ces bornes de stationnement avec les minutes qui défilent ?air saturéUn léger mieux mais la pollution de l’air va revenir pour plusieurs joursPlanèteStrasbourgMétéo-FranceNeigeBas-RhinGrand EstAlsaceMétéoPrécédentSuivantLes + lusLes + lus Planète1Double homicideLe jeune couple porté disparu depuis mercredi retrouvé mort, une enquête pour meurtre ouverte2HISTORIQUELe plus grand iceberg du monde va percuter une île britannique3PROMESSES DE CAMPAGNEPremières expulsions de masse de l’administration Trump vers le GuatemalaVoir les articles les + lus1HISTORIQUELe plus grand iceberg du monde va percuter une île britannique2météoC’est quoi cette « bombe météorologique » qui va frôler la France ?3ANIMAUX SAUVAGESUn félin non identifié, qui ressemble à un Serval, aperçu près de LyonVoir les articles les + lusTOURISME•6 janv. 2025Que faire à Lanzarote sur un grand week-end ?En partenariat avec HachetteLe DirectliveliveEN DIRECT Biathlon : Les Bleus peuvent-ils aller nous chercher le 4 à la suite ?..

loin. A <a class=\"color-ultramarine c-link\" href=\"https://www.20minutes.fr/strasbourg/\">Strasbourg</a> ces derniers jours, la <a class=\"color-ultramarine c-link\" href=\"https://www.20minutes.fr/dossier/neige\">neige</a> choisit ses quartiers. La Robertsau surtout, Neudorf un peu, voire la commune voisine d’Hoenheim… Mais pourquoi là et pas ailleurs ?</p>, <p>« C’est localisé autour du port du Rhin où il y a une forte activité industrielle », éclaire Gabriel Chamoulaud, prévisionniste à l’antenne locale de <a class=\"color-ultramarine c-link\" href=\"https://www.20minutes.fr/dossier/meteo_france\">Météo-France</a>. Logique, ce n’est pas de la neige traditionnelle qui tombe mais une dite « industrielle », ou « de pollution ». Comme cela est déjà arrivé ailleurs en France, comme <a class=\"color-ultramarine c-link\" href=\"https://www.20minutes.fr/nantes/3223231-20220125-nantes-neige-industrielle-encore-tombee-agglo\">à Nantes</a> ou <a class=\"color-ultramarine c-link\" href=\"https://www.20minutes.fr/planete/4070823-20240116-faut-inquieter-neige-urbaine-tombee-seul-quartier-toulouse\">Toulouse</a>.</p>, <p>« Pour qu’il y en ait, il faut d’abord des conditions anticycloniques très stables », détaille le météorologue conseil. « Actuellement, un air froid est piégé en basse couche au sol, surplombé par un air doux. Cette stratification de l’atmosphère piège ainsi l’humidité et les polluants près du sol. Ces derniers vont alors jouer le rôle de noyaux de condensation et la vapeur d’eau va s’accrocher à eux pour former des flocons. Toujours en faible quantité. »</p>, <p>Suffisamment pour recouvrir, depuis mardi matin, La Robertsau donc. Qui restait blanche ce mercredi. « C’est comme si on était en plein hiver. Tous les arbres sont recouverts et ça a du mal à fondre », appuie une fleuriste habituée à ce phénomène. « Je sais que c’est lié aux usines. Ce n’est pas naturel et on le voit à la neige, elle est bizarre. »</p>, <p>« Les flocons ont des structures en forme d’aiguilles, non en branches ou en étoiles », confirme Gabriel Chamoulaud en indiquant qu’ils devraient vite disparaître. Un redoux est attendu dans les prochaines heures dans la région. « Il va arriver dans le nord de l’<a class=\"color-ultramarine c-link\" href=\"https://www.20minutes.fr/dossier/alsace\">Alsace</a> demain [jeudi] matin et à Strasbourg en cours de journée. On va changer de régime de temps, ce sera plus instable. »</p>, <p>Les températures devraient nettement remonter au-dessus de 0 °C, après plusieurs jours dans le négatif. L’hiver 2024-2025 serait-il plus froid que les précédents ? « Par rapport aux normales de ces trente dernières années, on est légèrement au-dessus », relativise le spécialiste. « Le dernier <a class=\"color-ultramarine c-link\" href=\"https://www.20minutes.fr/dossier/hiver\">hiver</a> froid remonte à 2017. »</p>, <p class=\"mb-xs@xs font-weight-bold@xs text-l@xs\">À lire aussi</p>, <p class=\"font-weight-bold@xs text-xxs@xs\">01:31</p>, <p class=\"mb-l@xs color-white font-weight-bold@xs text-m@xs\">Nos applications</p>, <p class=\"mb-l@xs color-white\">Découvrez l‘ensemble de nos applications 20 Minutes !</p>, <p class=\"font-weight-bold@xs\">App Store</p>, <p class=\"font-weight-bold@xs\">Google Play</p>, <p class=\"mb-l@xs color-white font-weight-bold@xs text-m@xs\">Archives</p>, <p class=\"mb-l@xs c-footer-categories__list__title\">Actualités</p>, <p class=\"mb-l@xs c-footer-categories__list__title\">Services</p>, <p class=\"mb-l@xs c-footer-categories__list__title\">20 Minutes</p>, <p class=\"mb-l@xs c-footer-categories__list__title\">Jeux</p>, <p class=\"mb-l@xs c-footer-categories__list__title\">Shopping</p>, <p class=\"mb-l@xs c-footer-categories__list__title\">Codes promo</p>, <p class=\"color-white\">La fréquentation de 20 Minutes est certifiée par l‘ACPM</p>]\n",

      "Perhaps one of the clearest indications of the Anthropocene may be the presence of plastic. Starting with the commercialization of Bakelite in 1907 by Leo Baekeland, plastics have taken the world by storm. Courtesy of being easy to mold into any imaginable shape along with a wide range of properties that depend on the exact polymer used, it’s hard to imagine modern-day society without plastics.\n",
      "Yet as the saying goes, there never is a free lunch. In the case of plastics it would appear that the exact same properties that make them so desirable also risk them becoming a hazard to not just our environment, but also to ourselves. With plastics degrading mostly into ever smaller pieces once released into the environment, they eventually become small enough to hitch a ride from our food into our bloodstream and from there into our organs, including our brain as evidenced by a recent study.\n",
      "Multiple studies have indicated that this bioaccumulation of plastics might be harmful, raising the question about how to mitigate and prevent both the ingestion of microplastics as well as producing them in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Polymer Trouble\n",
      "Plastics are effectively synthetic or semi-synthetic polymers. This means that the final shape, whether it’s an enclosure, a bag, rope or something else entirely consists of many monomers that polymerized in a specific shape. This offers many benefits over traditional materials like wood, glass and metals, all of which cannot be used for the same wide range of applications, including food packaging and modern electronics.\n",
      "Photodegradation of a plastic bucket used as an open-air flowerpot for some years. (Credit: Pampuco, Wikimedia)\n",
      "Unlike a composite organic polymer like wood, however, plastics do not noticeably biodegrade. When exposed to wear and tear, they mostly break down into polymer fragments that remain in the environment and are likely to fragment further. When these fragments are less than 5 mm in length, they are called ‘microplastics’, which are further subdivided into a nanoplastics group once they reach a length of less than 1 micrometer. Collectively these are called MNPs.\n",
      "The process of polymer degradation can have many causes. In the case of e.g. wood fibers, various microorganisms as well as chemicals will readily degrade these. For plastics the primary processes are oxidation and chain scission, which in the environment occurs through UV-radiation, oxygen, water, etc. Some plastics (e.g. with a carbon backbone) are susceptible to hydrolysis, while others degrade mostly through the interaction of UV-radiation with oxygen (photo-oxidation). The purpose of stabilizers added to plastics is to retard the effect of these processes, with antioxidants, UV absorbers, etc. added. These only slow down the polymer degradation, naturally.\n",
      "In short, although plastics that end up in the environment seem to vanish, they mostly break down in ever smaller polymer fragments that end up basically everywhere.\n",
      "Body-Plastic Ratio\n",
      "In a recent review article, Dr. Eric Topol covers contemporary studies on the topic of MNPs, with a particular focus on the new findings about MNPs found in the (human) brain, but also from a cardiovascular perspective. The latter references a March 2024 study by Raffaele Marfella et al. as published in The New England Journal of Medicine. In this study the excised plaque from carotid arteries in patients undergoing endarterectomy (arterial blockage removal) was examined for the presence of MNPs prior to the patients being followed to see whether the presence of MNPs affected their health.\n",
      "What they found was that of the 257 patients who completed the full study duration 58.4% had polyethylene (PE) in these plaques, while 12.1% also had polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in them. The PE and PVC MNPs were concentrated in macrophages, alongside active inflammation markers. During the follow-up period during the study, of the patients without MNPs 8 of 107 (7.5%) suffered either a nonfatal myocardial infarction, a nonfatal stroke or death. This contrasted with 30 of 150 (20%) in the group with MNP detected, suggesting that the presence of MNP in one’s cardiovascular system puts one at significantly higher risk of these adverse events.\n",
      "Microplastics in the human body. (Credit: Richard C. Thompson et al., Science, 2024)\n",
      "The presence of MNPs has not only been confirmed in arteries, but effectively in every other organ and tissue of the body as well. Recently the impact on the human brain has been investigated as well, with a study in Nature Medicine by Alexander J. Nihart et al. investigating MNP levels in decedent human brains as well the liver and kidneys. They found mostly PE, but also other plastic polymers, with the brain tissue having the highest PE proportion.\n",
      "Interestingly, the more recently deceased had more MNP in their organs, and the brains of those with known dementia diagnosis had higher MNP levels than those without. This raises the question of whether the presence of MNPs in the brain can affect or even induce dementia and other disorders of the brain.\n",
      "Using mouse models, Haipeng Huang et al. investigated the effects of MNPs on the brain, demonstrating that nanoplastics can pass through the blood-brain barrier, after which phagocytes consume these particles. These then go on to form blockages within the capillaries of the brain’s cortex, providing a mechanism through which MNPs are neurotoxic.\n",
      "Prevention\n",
      "Clearly the presence of MNPs in our bodies does not appear to be a good thing, and the only thing that we can realistically do about it at this point is to prevent ingesting (and inhaling) it, while preventing more plastics from ending up in the environment where it’ll inevitably start its gradual degradation into MNPs. To accomplish this, there are things that can be done, ranging from a personal level to national and international projects.\n",
      "On a personal level, wearing a respirator while being in dusty environments, while working with plastics, etc. is helpful, while avoiding e.g. bottled water. According to a recent study by Naixin Qian et al. from the University of California they found on average 240,000 particles of MNPs in a liter of bottled water, with 90% of these being nanoplastics. As noted in a related article, bottled water can be fairly safe, but has to be stored correctly (i.e. not exposed to the sun). Certain water filters (e.g. Brita) filter particles o.5 – 1 micrometer in size and should filter out most MNPs as well from tap water.\n",
      "Another source of MNPs are plastic containers, with old and damaged plastic containers more likely to contaminate food stored in them. If a container begins to look degraded (i.e. faded colors), it’s probably a good time to stop using it for food.\n",
      "That said, as some exposure to MNPs is hard to avoid, the best one can do here is to limited said exposure.\n",
      "Environmental Pollution\n",
      "Bluntly put, if there wasn’t environmental contamination with plastic fragments such personal precautions would not be necessary. This leads us to the three Rs:\n",
      "\n",
      "Reduce\n",
      "Reuse\n",
      "Recycle\n",
      "\n",
      "Simply put, the less plastic we use, the less plastic pollution there will be. If we reuse plastic items more often (with advanced stabilizers to reduce degradation), fewer plastic items would need to be produced, and once plastic items have no more use, they should be recycled. This is basically where all the problems begin.\n",
      "Using less plastic is extremely hard for today’s societies, as these synthetic polymers are basically everywhere, and some economical sectors essentially exist because of single-use plastic packaging. Just try to imagine a supermarket or food takeout (including fast food) without plastics. A potential option is to replace plastics with an alternative (glass, etc.), but the viability here remains low, beyond replacing effectively single use plastic shopping bags with multi-use non-plastic bags.\n",
      "Some sources of microplastics like from make-up and beauty products have been (partially) addressed already, but it’d be best if plastic could be easily recycled, and if microorganisms developed a taste for these polymers.\n",
      "Dismal Recycling\n",
      "Currently only about 10-15% of the plastic we produce is recycled, with the remainder incinerated, buried in landfills or discarded as litter into the environment as noted in this recent article by Mark Peplow. A big issue is that the waste stream features every imaginable type of plastic mixed along with other (organic) contaminants, making it extremely hard to even begin to sort the plastic types.\n",
      "The solution suggested in the article is to reduce the waste stream back to its original (oil-derived) components as much as possible using high temperatures and pressures. If this new hydrothermal liquefaction approach which is currently being trialed by Mura Technology works well enough, it could replace mechanical recycling and the compromises which this entails, especially inferior quality compared to virgin plastic, and an inability to deal with mixed plastics.\n",
      "Hydrothermal liquefaction process of plastics. (source: Mura Technology)\n",
      "If a method like this can increase the recycling rate of plastics, it could significantly reduce the amount of landfill and litter plastic, and thus with it the production of MNPs.\n",
      "Microorganism Solutions\n",
      "As mentioned earlier, a nice thing about natural polymers like those in wood is that there are many organisms who specialize in breaking these down. This is the reason why plant matter and even entire trees will decay and effectively vanish, with its fundamental elements being repurposed by other organisms and those that prey on these. Wouldn’t it be amazing if plastics could vanish in a similar manner rather than hang around for a few hundred years?\n",
      "As it turns out, life does indeed find a way, and researchers have discovered multiple species of bacteria, fungi and microalgae which are reported to biodegrade PET (polyethylene terephthalate), which accounts for 6.2% of plastics produced. Perhaps it’s not so surprising that microorganisms would adapt to thrive on plastics, since we are absolutely swamping the oceans with it, giving the rapid evolutionary cycle of bacteria and similar a strong nudge to prefer breaking down plastics over driftwood and other detritus in the oceans.\n",
      "Naturally, PET is just one of many types of plastics, and generally plastics are not an attractive target for microbes, as Zeming Cai et al. note in a 2023 review article in Microorganisms. Also noted is that there are some fungal strains that degrade HDPE and LDPE, two of the most common types of plastics. These organisms are however not quite at the level where they can cope with the massive influx of new plastic waste, even before taking into account additives to plastics that are toxic to organisms.\n",
      "Ultimately it would seem that evolution will probably fix the plastic waste issue if given a few thousand years, but before that, we smart human monkeys would do best to not create a problem where it doesn’t need to exist. At least if we don’t want to all become part of a mass-experiment on the effects of high-dose MNP exposure.\n",

      "  Unlike a composite organic polymer like wood, however, plastics do not noticeably biodegrade\n",
      "\n",
      "Untrue. Most types of plastics do biodegrade with a half-life of months. The difference is that macroscopic particles are hard to break down because the organisms and their enzymes attach to the ends of polymer chains which are inaccessible in large particles, but readily available in micro- and nanoparticles of plastic. The biological half life speeds up as the plastic breaks down to smaller sizes. E.g. rubber tire dust along roads is eaten up over the course of a year – even the synthetic kind.\n",
      "The confusion comes from the definition of “microparticles” which includes pieces up to 3 mm in size, which is a massive piece in terms of bacteria. A whole plastic bag thrown in the woods takes decades to disappear. When you count these particles in the mix, it indeed looks like microparticles don’t biodegrade significantly, but these particles are eventually broken down mechanically and photochemically to the point that they become food to soil bacteria and fungi.\n",

Yes, they decompose, but the plants do not stop producing them.\n",

      "[<p>Perhaps one of the clearest indications of the Anthropocene may be the presence of plastic. Starting with the commercialization of Bakelite in 1907 by Leo Baekeland, plastics have taken the world by storm. Courtesy of being easy to mold into any imaginable shape along with a wide range of properties that depend on the exact polymer used, it’s hard to imagine modern-day society without plastics.</p>, <p>Yet as the saying goes, there never is a free lunch. In the case of plastics it would appear that the exact same properties that make them so desirable also risk them becoming a hazard to not just our environment, but also to ourselves. With plastics degrading mostly into ever smaller pieces once released into the environment, they eventually become small enough to hitch a ride from our food into our bloodstream and from there into our organs, including our brain as evidenced by a recent study.</p>, <p>Multiple studies have indicated that this bioaccumulation of plastics might be harmful, raising the question about how to mitigate and prevent both the ingestion of microplastics as well as producing them in the first place.</p>, <p><span id=\"more-757525\"></span></p>, <p>Plastics are effectively synthetic or semi-synthetic polymers. This means that the final shape, whether it’s an enclosure, a bag, rope or something else entirely consists of many monomers that polymerized in a specific shape. This offers many benefits over traditional materials like wood, glass and metals, all of which cannot be used for the same wide range of applications, including food packaging and modern electronics.</p>, <p>Unlike a composite organic polymer like wood, however, plastics do not noticeably biodegrade. When exposed to wear and tear, they mostly break down into polymer fragments that remain in the environment and are likely to fragment further. When these fragments are less than 5 mm in length, they are called ‘microplastics’, which are further subdivided into a nanoplastics group once they reach a length of less than 1 micrometer. Collectively these are called MNPs.</p>, <p>The process of polymer degradation can have many causes. In the case of e.g. wood fibers, various microorganisms as well as chemicals will readily degrade these. For plastics the primary processes are oxidation and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_scission\" target=\"_blank\">chain scission</a>, which in the environment occurs through UV-radiation, oxygen, water, etc. Some plastics (e.g. with a carbon backbone) are susceptible to hydrolysis, while others degrade mostly through the interaction of UV-radiation with oxygen (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo-oxidation_of_polymers\" target=\"_blank\">photo-oxidation</a>). The purpose of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polymer_stabilizer\" target=\"_blank\">stabilizers</a> added to plastics is to retard the effect of these processes, with antioxidants, UV absorbers, etc. added. These only slow down the polymer degradation, naturally.</p>, <p>In short, although plastics that end up in the environment seem to vanish, they mostly break down in ever smaller polymer fragments that end up basically everywhere.</p>, <p>In a <a href=\"https://erictopol.substack.com/p/the-microplastic-concerns-elevateto\" target=\"_blank\">recent review article</a>, Dr. Eric Topol covers contemporary studies on the topic of MNPs, with a particular focus on the new findings about MNPs found in the (human) brain, but also from a cardiovascular perspective. The latter references a March 2024 study <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822\" target=\"_blank\">by Raffaele Marfella et al.</a> as published in <em>The New England Journal of Medicine</em>. In this study the excised plaque from carotid arteries in patients undergoing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endarterectomy\" target=\"_blank\">endarterectomy</a> (arterial blockage removal) was examined for the presence of MNPs prior to the patients being followed to see whether the presence of MNPs affected their health.</p>, <p>What they found was that of the 257 patients who completed the full study duration 58.4% had polyethylene (PE) in these plaques, while 12.1% also had polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in them. The PE and PVC MNPs were concentrated in macrophages, alongside active inflammation markers. During the follow-up period during the study, of the patients without MNPs 8 of 107 (7.5%) suffered either a nonfatal myocardial infarction, a nonfatal stroke or death. This contrasted with 30 of 150 (20%) in the group with MNP detected, suggesting that the presence of MNP in one’s cardiovascular system puts one at significantly higher risk of these adverse events.</p>, <p>The presence of MNPs has not only been confirmed in arteries, but effectively in every other organ and tissue of the body as well. Recently the impact on the human brain has been investigated as well, with a study in <em>Nature Medicine</em> by Alexander J. Nihart et al. investigating MNP levels in decedent human brains as well the liver and kidneys. They found mostly PE, but also other plastic polymers, with the brain tissue having the highest PE proportion.</p>, <p>Interestingly, the more recently deceased had more MNP in their organs, and the brains of those with known dementia diagnosis had higher MNP levels than those without. This raises the question of whether the presence of MNPs in the brain can affect or even induce dementia and other disorders of the brain.</p>, <p>Using mouse models, <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adr8243\" target=\"_blank\">Haipeng Huang et al.</a> investigated the effects of MNPs on the brain, demonstrating that nanoplastics can pass through the blood-brain barrier, after which phagocytes consume these particles. These then go on to form blockages within the capillaries of the brain’s cortex, providing a mechanism through which MNPs are neurotoxic.</p>, <p><a href=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/water_bottles.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-468342 alignright\" data-attachment-id=\"468342\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-meta='{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}' data-image-title=\"water_bottles\" data-large-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/water_bottles.jpg?w=800\" data-medium-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/water_bottles.jpg?w=400\" data-orig-file=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/water_bottles.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1024,683\" data-permalink=\"https://hackaday.com/2021/03/24/ask-hackaday-how-do-you-prepare/water_bottles/\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"267\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" src=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/water_bottles.jpg?w=400\" srcset=\"https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/water_bottles.jpg 1024w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/water_bottles.jpg?resize=250,167 250w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/water_bottles.jpg?resize=400,267 400w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/water_bottles.jpg?resize=800,534 800w\" width=\"400\"/></a>Clearly the presence of MNPs in our bodies does not appear to be a good thing, and the only thing that we can realistically do about it at this point is to prevent ingesting (and inhaling) it, while preventing more plastics from ending up in the environment where it’ll inevitably start its gradual degradation into MNPs. To accomplish this, there are things that can be done, ranging from a personal level to national and international projects.</p>, <p>On a personal level, wearing a respirator while being in dusty environments, while working with plastics, etc. is helpful, while avoiding e.g. bottled water. According to a <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2300582121\" target=\"_blank\">recent study by Naixin Qian et al.</a> from the University of California they found on average 240,000 particles of MNPs in a liter of bottled water, with 90% of these being nanoplastics. As <a href=\"https://health.clevelandclinic.org/nanoplastics-in-water-bottles\" target=\"_blank\">noted in a related article</a>, bottled water can be fairly safe, but has to be stored correctly (i.e. not exposed to the sun). Certain water filters (e.g. Brita) filter particles o.5 – 1 micrometer in size and <a href=\"https://purewaterblog.com/do-brita-filters-remove-microplastics/\" target=\"_blank\">should filter out most MNPs</a> as well from tap water.</p>, <p>Another source of MNPs are plastic containers, with old and damaged plastic containers more likely to contaminate food stored in them. If a container begins to look degraded (i.e. faded colors), it’s probably a good time to stop using it for food.</p>, <p>That said, as some exposure to MNPs is hard to avoid, the best one can do here is to limited said exposure.</p>, <p>Bluntly put, if there wasn’t environmental contamination with plastic fragments such personal precautions would not be necessary. This leads us to the three Rs:</p>, <p>Simply put, the less plastic we use, the less plastic pollution there will be. If we reuse plastic items more often (with advanced stabilizers to reduce degradation), fewer plastic items would need to be produced, and once plastic items have no more use, they should be recycled. This is basically where all the problems begin.</p>, <p>Using less plastic is extremely hard for today’s societies, as these synthetic polymers are basically everywhere, and some economical sectors essentially exist because of single-use plastic packaging. Just try to imagine a supermarket or food takeout (including fast food) without plastics. A potential option is to replace plastics with an alternative (glass, etc.), but the viability here remains low, beyond replacing effectively single use plastic shopping bags with multi-use non-plastic bags.</p>, <p>Some sources of microplastics like from make-up and beauty products have been (partially) addressed already, but it’d be best if plastic could be easily recycled, and if microorganisms developed a taste for these polymers.</p>, <p>Currently only about 10-15% of the plastic we produce is recycled, with the remainder incinerated, buried in landfills or discarded as litter into the environment as noted in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00293-y\" target=\"_blank\">this recent article by Mark Peplow</a>. A big issue is that the waste stream features every imaginable type of plastic mixed along with other (organic) contaminants, making it extremely hard to even begin to sort the plastic types.</p>, <p>The solution suggested in the article is to reduce the waste stream back to its original (oil-derived) components as much as possible using high temperatures and pressures. If this new hydrothermal liquefaction approach which is currently being trialed by Mura Technology works well enough, it could replace mechanical recycling and the compromises which this entails, especially inferior quality compared to virgin plastic, and an inability to deal with mixed plastics.</p>, <p>If a method like this can increase the recycling rate of plastics, it could significantly reduce the amount of landfill and litter plastic, and thus with it the production of MNPs.</p>, <p>As mentioned earlier, a nice thing about natural polymers like those in wood is that there are many organisms who specialize in breaking these down. This is the reason why plant matter and even entire trees will decay and effectively vanish, with its fundamental elements being repurposed by other organisms and those that prey on these. Wouldn’t it be amazing if plastics could vanish in a similar manner rather than hang around for a few hundred years?</p>, <p>As it turns out, life does indeed find a way, and researchers <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-023-05470-1\" target=\"_blank\">have discovered multiple species</a> of bacteria, fungi and microalgae which are reported to biodegrade <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_terephthalate\" target=\"_blank\">PET</a> (polyethylene terephthalate), which accounts for 6.2% of plastics produced. Perhaps it’s not so surprising that microorganisms would adapt to thrive on plastics, since we are absolutely swamping the oceans with it, giving the rapid evolutionary cycle of bacteria and similar a strong nudge to prefer breaking down plastics over driftwood and other detritus in the oceans.</p>, <p>Naturally, PET is just one of many types of plastics, and generally plastics are not an attractive target for microbes, as <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10386651/\" target=\"_blank\">Zeming Cai et al. note in a 2023 review article</a> in <em>Microorganisms</em>. Also noted is that there are some fungal strains that degrade HDPE and LDPE, two of the most common types of plastics. These organisms are however not quite at the level where they can cope with the massive influx of new plastic waste, even before taking into account additives to plastics that are toxic to organisms.</p>, <p>Ultimately it would seem that evolution will probably fix the plastic waste issue if given a few thousand years, but before that, we smart human monkeys would do best to not create a problem where it doesn’t need to exist. At least if we don’t want to all become part of a mass-experiment on the effects of high-dose MNP exposure.</p>, <p>Why isn’t this movie mentioned? <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9071322/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9071322/</a><br/>\n",

Many studies have shown that there are huge amounts of micro- and nano-plastics in a cup of tea (up to 11 billion in a single cup). As Paul LeBlanc commented, even paper teabags still use plastic glue and edge sealants.

Particularly with larger fast food chains. Try to rip the drink containers and I guarantee most are plastic lined (not waxed).

      "  Unlike a composite organic polymer like wood, however, plastics do not noticeably biodegrade\n",
      "</p>, <p>Untrue. Most types of plastics do biodegrade with a half-life of months. The difference is that macroscopic particles are hard to break down because the organisms and their enzymes attach to the ends of polymer chains which are inaccessible in large particles, but readily available in micro- and nanoparticles of plastic. The biological half life speeds up as the plastic breaks down to smaller sizes. E.g. rubber tire dust along roads is eaten up over the course of a year – even the synthetic kind.</p>, <p>The confusion comes from the definition of “microparticles” which includes pieces up to 3 mm in size, which is a massive piece in terms of bacteria. A whole plastic bag thrown in the woods takes decades to disappear. When you count these particles in the mix, it indeed looks like microparticles don’t biodegrade significantly, but these particles are eventually broken down mechanically and photochemically to the point that they become food to soil bacteria and fungi.</p>, <p>I’m sorry, but there is no analysis here of what happens to cellulose, which is arguably the most widely  dispersed polymer on the planet.  It is created by plants, so we eat them, digest them, and excrete them, but not all of them.  A lot end up floating all around us, in the water, in the air, and in the soil.  Yes, they decompose, but the plants do not stop producing them.</p>, <p>And then there is fur and hair, which are polymers of keratins, a protein.  Pet lovers live in a cloud of them, from the fur and hair that their pets create and distribute throughout their homes.  They are everywhere, too.</p>, <p>Who is looking for these polymers? Someone needs to explain why we don’t all die from all the ills that supposedly exist because of man-made polymers.</p>, <p>I sense that this new anti man-made polymer  movement is very much like the movement to eliminate man-made sources of ionizing radiation like nuclear reactors, because they are so harmful, without considering all the naturally generated radiation that also surrounds us like a cloud. When I ask questions about radiation, the usual response is that manmade radiation is somehow “different”, and “natural”, and therefore harmless or not to be worried about.  This is absolutely false.</p>, <p>I would also note some other naturally occurring substances that are polymers, such as keratin, chitin, collagen,  and gelatin.  This from a very quick search for naturally occurring polymers.  They may degrade more quickly than man-made polymers, but they are generated by nature in MUCH larger amounts, continuously.</p>, <p>Also those are all completely expected and known by all existing bio-systems, unlike i.e. Teflon. To imply equivalence is pretty dishonest, why would you do that?</p>, <p>Do you know how long it took for something to finally evolve that can break down lignin?</p>, <p>people are looking for and studying these natural polymers and i think it’s an interesting thing to study. but disingenuine to say they haven’t been studied or that they are the same as artificial polymers.  i’m replying because i think you very impressively distilled why ‘whataboutism’ is harmful even though ‘what about’ is a great question.</p>, <p>what about cellulose?  i don’t know.  but that’s not an answer about polyethylene.  it’s a question worth answering on its own.</p>, <p>Humans have been making things out of plastic for 9000 years, and if you disagree it is probably in part because you don’t appreciate what a carbon based polymer really is.</p>, <p>Please be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

      "Drax, the British owner of wood pellet plants in Mississippi and Louisiana that has paid millions in fines and settlements for violating state pollution laws in recent years, has received at least $762 million in “green” loans during that same period, an investigation by The Examination, The Toronto Star, and Mississippi Today found. \n",
      "The energy company ships out wood pellets made in North America for other countries to use as a power source to meet their carbon reduction goals. But state regulators in both Mississippi and Louisiana have come down on Drax over its local air pollution. Between penalties and settlements over the last five years, Drax has had to pay out over a combined $5 million to the two states. \n",
      "Since 2018, banks have issued $1.5 trillion in low-interest “sustainability-linked loans,” or SLLs, to large corporations to motivate climate-friendly practices. Wood biomass companies, such as Drax, alone received over $76 billion in SLLs between 2018 and 2023, the investigation found using data from the London Stock Exchange and the Environmental Paper Network.\n",
      "Drax received two such loans: one in 2020 that became the equivalent of $553 million — issued by a group of banks including Bank of America, Barclays, and JP Morgan — and another in 2021 equal to $208 million.\n",

      "While companies have environmental benchmarks that go with the loans, there’s little oversight or public disclosure over what those goals are or whether the companies accomplish them. Drax maintains it has reduced its overall carbon footprint since receiving its SLLs; according to its most recent annual report, the company lowered its carbon emissions by 27 percent from 2020 to 2023. \n",
      "Myrtis Woodard, left, and other Gloster residents talk about their health issues due to the Drax wood facility in Gloster, Mississippi, in July 2024.  Eric Shelton / Mississippi Today\n",
      "However, scientists around the world have argued for years that using wood pellets for electricity actually creates more carbon emissions than using coal or gas. Not only does burning pellets release carbon into the air, but so does cutting down the trees — which store carbon and take years to regrow — to make the pellets.\n",
      "“As numerous studies have shown, this burning of wood will increase warming for decades to centuries,” hundreds of professors and other experts wrote in a 2021 letter to world leaders including President Biden. “That is true even when the wood replaces coal, oil, or natural gas.”\n",
      "Despite the wide-ranging contentions, global industrial leaders like the United Kingdom have embraced biomass, including wood pellets, as an energy source. The U.K.’s 2024 “Clean Power 2030 Action Plan” says biomass could be an important part of its transition to clean energy, and in 2023 a quarter of the country’s renewable energy generation came from “biogenic” sources such as biomass.\n",

      "In a written response to questions for this story, Drax defended the use of pellets for electricity.\n",
      "“While we recognize that there is an ongoing debate with respect to the range of solutions required to most effectively combat the climate crisis, we believe that energy from biomass, when sourced sustainably, is an important contributor to the decarbonization of electricity generation,” the company said via email.\n",
      "But Drax, which mostly uses wood from the United States and Canada, recently came under fire over how it sources its pellets. Last year, the U.K. government issued a 25 million pound fine (around $31 million) to the company, in part because Drax failed to fully detail where it sourced wood pellets made in Canada. \n",

      "In Mississippi, environmental regulators fined the company $225,000 last year for releasing 50 percent over its permitted limit of hazardous air pollutants, or HAPs, from its plant in the small town of Gloster. But meanwhile, the company is applying to become a “major” source of HAPs, a designation that allows greater emissions with added pollution reduction controls. \n",
      "Allison Brouk, a senior attorney for Earthjustice, said it doesn’t make sense that Drax gets to graduate through the regulatory system the way it has.\n",
      "“They applied for a minor source permit, emitted at major source levels until they were fined and [state regulators] made them change that,” Brouk said. “It’s a pattern Drax has taken, somehow, just to work with the system.”  \n",
      "Last year’s fine was Drax’s second in Mississippi for violating air pollutant limits. In 2020, the state fined Drax $2.5 million, one of the largest such penalties in state history, for emitting over three times the legal limit for volatile organic compounds, or VOCs. Shortly after the fine was announced, Drax announced receiving its first SLL. \n",
      "State regulators found that Drax also exceeded its legal limit of VOC releases at its two plants in Louisiana. While the company didn’t have to admit to any wrongdoing, Drax agreed to pay a  combined settlement of $3.2 million in 2022. It was the largest amount paid to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality in the last decade, The Times-Picayune reported. \n",
      "In September, Drax announced plans to invest $12.5 billion to develop its biomass operation in the U.S. with added carbon capture and storage technology, Reuters reported. Groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council, though, argue that the technology will only lead to greater emissions.  \n",
      "While the intended goal of SLLs is to encourage sustainable practices in large corporations, loan recipients in some cases have framed their emissions metrics in misleading ways, The Examination found. Read the outlet’s full investigation into the world of SLLs.\n",
      "This investigation is reported in partnership with The Examination, Mississippi Today, and Toronto Star. This reporting was supported by the Pulitzer Center’s Rainforest Investigations Network.\n",

But state regulators in both Mississippi and Louisiana have come down on Drax over its local air pollution. Between penalties and settlements over the last five years, Drax has had to pay out over a combined $5 million to the two states. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Since 2018, banks have issued $1.5 trillion in low-interest “sustainability-linked loans,” or SLLs, to large corporations to motivate climate-friendly practices. Wood biomass companies, such as Drax, alone received over $76 billion in SLLs between 2018 and 2023, the investigation found using data from the London Stock Exchange and the Environmental Paper Network.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Drax received two such loans: one in 2020 that became the equivalent of $553 million — issued by a group of banks including Bank of America, Barclays, and JP Morgan — and another in 2021 equal to $208 million.</p>, <p>Grist thanks its sponsors. <a href=\"https://grist.org/advertising/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Become one</a>.</p>, <p class=\"modal-content__message\">To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider <a href=\"https://grist.org/how-to-whitelist-grist\" target=\"_blank\">disabling your ad-blocker</a> to allow ads on Grist. <a class=\"modal-content__link\" href=\"https://grist.org/how-to-whitelist-grist\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"modal-content__link-text\">Here's How</span><span class=\"icon-right-1\"></span></a></p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">While companies have environmental benchmarks that go with the loans, there’s little oversight or public disclosure over what those goals are or whether the companies accomplish them. Drax maintains it has reduced its overall carbon footprint since receiving its SLLs; according to its most recent annual report, the company lowered its carbon emissions by 27 percent from 2020 to 2023. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">However, scientists around the world have argued for years that using wood pellets for electricity actually creates more carbon emissions than using coal or gas. Not only does burning pellets release carbon into the air, but so does cutting down the trees — which store carbon and take years to regrow — to make the pellets.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“As numerous studies have shown, this burning of wood will increase warming for decades to centuries,” hundreds of professors and other experts wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20482842-scientist-leter-to-biden-van-der-leyden-michel-suga-moon-february-11-2021/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2021 letter</a> to world leaders including President Biden. “That is true even when the wood replaces coal, oil, or natural gas.”</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Despite the wide-ranging contentions, global industrial leaders like the United Kingdom have embraced biomass, including wood pellets, as an energy source. The U.K.’s 2024 “<a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/677bc80399c93b7286a396d6/clean-power-2030-action-plan-main-report.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Clean Power 2030 Action Plan</a>” says biomass could be an important part of its transition to clean energy, and in 2023 a quarter of the country’s renewable energy generation came from “biogenic” sources such as biomass.</p>, <p>Grist thanks its sponsors. <a href=\"https://grist.org/advertising/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Become one</a>.</p>, <p class=\"modal-content__message\">To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider <a href=\"https://grist.org/how-to-whitelist-grist\" target=\"_blank\">disabling your ad-blocker</a> to allow ads on Grist. <a class=\"modal-content__link\" href=\"https://grist.org/how-to-whitelist-grist\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"modal-content__link-text\">Here's How</span><span class=\"icon-right-1\"></span></a></p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">In a written response to questions for this story, Drax defended the use of pellets for electricity.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“While we recognize that there is an ongoing debate with respect to the range of solutions required to most effectively combat the climate crisis, we believe that energy from biomass, when sourced sustainably, is an important contributor to the <span class=\"tooltipsall tooltipsincontent classtoolTips2\">decarbonization</span> of electricity generation,” the company said via email.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">But Drax, which mostly uses wood from the United States and Canada, recently came under fire over how it sources its pellets. Last year, the U.K. government <a href=\"https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications/ofgem-decision-investigation-drax-power-limited\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">issued</a> a 25 million pound fine (around $31 million) to the company, in part because Drax failed to fully detail where it sourced wood pellets made in Canada. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">In Mississippi, environmental regulators <a href=\"https://mississippitoday.org/2024/09/12/drax-receives-another-fine-for-air-pollution-violations-in-gloster/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">fined</a> the company $225,000 last year for releasing 50 percent over its permitted limit of hazardous air pollutants, or HAPs, from its plant in the small town of Gloster. But meanwhile, the company is <a href=\"https://mississippitoday.org/2024/11/15/gloster-residents-protest-draxs-new-permit-request/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">applying</a> to become a “major” source of HAPs, a designation that allows greater emissions with added pollution reduction controls. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Allison Brouk, a senior attorney for Earthjustice, said it doesn’t make sense that Drax gets to graduate through the regulatory system the way it has.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“They applied for a minor source permit, emitted at major source levels until they were fined and [state regulators] made them change that,” Brouk said. “It’s a pattern Drax has taken, somehow, just to work with the system.”  </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Last year’s fine was Drax’s second in Mississippi for violating air pollutant limits. In 2020, the state fined Drax $2.5 million, one of the largest such penalties in state history, for emitting over three times the legal limit for volatile organic compounds, or VOCs. Shortly after the fine was announced, Drax <a href=\"https://www.drax.com/investors/new-esg-rcf-and-financing-update/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> receiving its first SLL. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">State regulators found that Drax also exceeded its legal limit of VOC releases at its two plants in Louisiana. While the company didn’t have to admit to any wrongdoing, Drax agreed to pay a  combined settlement of $3.2 million in 2022. It was the largest amount paid to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality in the last decade, The <a href=\"https://www.nola.com/news/environment/british-company-agrees-to-pay-3-2-million-for-air-pollution-at-louisiana-wood-pellet/article_c451e610-4352-11ed-8a54-43df54e33cd5.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Times-Picayune reported</a>. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">In September, Drax announced plans to invest $12.5 billion to develop its biomass operation in the U.S. with added <span class=\"tooltipsall tooltipsincontent classtoolTips0\">carbon capture and storage</span> technology, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/uks-drax-invest-up-125-billion-us-biomass-power-plants-2024-09-24/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Reuters reported</a>.

Kevin Carter/Getty ImagesUmair Irfan is a correspondent at Vox writing about climate change, energy policy, and science. He is also a regular contributor to the radio program Science Friday. Prior to Vox, he was a reporter for ClimateWire at E&E News.Another round of snowy, chilly weather is gripping the United States this week, extending the frigid start to the year across much of North America. Yet despite the cold temperatures over the continent, the planet as a whole has set a new temperature record yet again: January 2025 was the hottest January ever measured on planet Earth.January 2025 was the hottest January ever measured.The European Union’s space program, Copernicus, and independent research group Berkeley Earth both confirmed the result. The planet was between 2.95 degrees Fahrenheit (1.64 Celsius) and 3.15 degrees F (1.75 C) warmer than the average January at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, back when humanity’s voracious appetite for coal, oil, and natural gas began to take off, spewing heat-trapping gasses into the atmosphere. While it fits the planet’s warming trend, the hot start to the year is still remarkable for a few reasons. It’s part of a run of unusual heat across the planet, even in the context of gradual global warming that humans have been driving since the Industrial Revolution. January was the 18th month out of the last 19 to have global average air temperatures greater than 2.7 F (1.5 C) above pre-industrial levels. Under the Paris Climate Agreement, countries agreed to try to limit warming this century to less than 2.7 F (1.5 C) on average. Having a year or two with temperatures above this threshold doesn’t mean that target’s been missed since it’s calculated as an average over decades, but it does mean the world is perilously close to overshooting this goal. Both 2023 and 2024 have successively been the hottest years humans have ever measured by a wide margin. According to Berkeley Earth, there’s a 30 percent chance that 2025 temperatures will climb even higher. Beyond climate change, which is driving up global temperatures over the long term, there were several other factors that contributed to the sustained spike in heat. The big one is that an especially strong El Niño took hold in 2023. This is the warm phase of the Pacific Ocean’s temperature cycle, which cycles every two to seven years. Warm water starts to spread west to east along the equator in the Pacific Ocean, which in turn alters evaporation and rainfall patterns across the world. The net effect is that El Niño warms up the planet. The Atlantic Ocean was also in the warm phase of its temperature cycle. A new air pollution regulation for shipping went into effect as well. This drastically curbed the emissions of aerosols like sulfur particles. That improved air quality for breathing, but those pollutants had the side effect of dimming the sky and reflecting sunlight back into space. Without them, more energy from the sun made its way into the ocean, particularly along busy shipping routes, heating up the water below. Similarly, recent reductions in air pollution from China contributed to warming in the Pacific Ocean. Weaker air currents over the ocean also slowed evaporation and allowed heat to accumulate. The convergence of all these factors led the planet’s oceans to absorb an extraordinary amount of heat, pushing water temperatures to record highs. Hot ocean temperatures can lead to heat waves underwater that can damage critical ecosystems like coral reefs. They’re also a key raw ingredient for tropical storms and hurricanes. Eventually, the pendulum is supposed to swing back and let the planet cool off a bit. El Niño started to fade last year, setting the stage for its cool counterpart, La Niña. This tends to lower global air temperatures. RelatedHow La Niña will shape heat and hurricanes this yearSo why was this past January still so hot around the world? “It would seem that the developing La Niña is not yet mature enough to overcome the warmth associated with widespread marine heatwave conditions around the globe,” said Dillon Amaya, a research scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in an email. “The equatorial Pacific crossed our usual La Niña threshold for the first time in January, but those anomalies need to be at least that strong for four more consecutive months before a La Niña is officially declared.”Oceans act like thermal batteries, and since they absorbed so much heat over the past two years, they are still running hot and raising global air temperatures. Amaya noted that 28 percent of Earth’s oceans experienced heat wave conditions in December 2024, when that number would typically be only 10 percent. NOAA’s forecast shows that about 26 percent of the oceans will experience heat waves into March, which will likely lead above-average air temperatures to persist across much of the world. Early measurements and models also show that this year’s La Niña isn’t going to be very strong and likely won’t cause big changes in weather patterns in the opposite direction. Then why was there so much bitter, icy weather across the United States this year? RelatedThis winter’s extreme cold snaps, explainedFrigid air from the Arctic spilled down across North America in January as a wobbly jet stream and oblong polar vortex stretched southward from the North Pole. Oddly, warming likely played a role here as well. The Arctic is heating up to four times faster than the rest of the planet. As its temperatures rise, they weaken the atmospheric currents that contain its cold weather to high latitudes. Air that is warm by Arctic standards is still chilly compared to air at lower latitudes, so it causes cold snaps when it leaks out. Even with these sudden temperature plunges, the overall trend is that winters are warming up faster than summers. As the climate changes, the knock-on effects won’t scale linearly, and as temperatures head into uncharted territory, there will be more surprises.

January was the 18th month out of the last 19 to have global average air temperatures greater than 2.7 F (1.5 C) above pre-industrial levels. Under the Paris Climate Agreement, countries agreed to try to limit warming this century to less than 2.7 F (1.5 C) on average. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Having a year or two with temperatures above this threshold doesn’t mean that target’s been missed since it’s calculated as an average over decades, but it does mean the world is perilously close to overshooting this goal. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Both <a href=\"/23969523/climate-change-cop28-paris-1-5-c-uae-2023-record-warm\">2023</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/temperatures-rising-nasa-confirms-2024-warmest-year-on-record/\">2024</a> have successively been the hottest years humans have ever measured by a wide margin. According to Berkeley Earth, there’s a 30 percent chance that 2025 temperatures will climb even higher. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Beyond climate change, which is driving up global temperatures over the long term, there were several other factors that contributed to the sustained spike in heat. The big one is that an especially strong <a href=\"/climate/23738846/el-nino-2023-weather-heat-wave-climate-change-disaster-flood-rain\">El Niño</a> took hold in 2023. This is the warm phase of the Pacific Ocean’s temperature cycle, which cycles every two to seven years. Warm water starts to spread west to east along the equator in the Pacific Ocean, which in turn alters evaporation and rainfall patterns across the world. The net effect is that El Niño warms up the planet. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">The Atlantic Ocean was also in the <a href=\"/climate/23762529/atlantic-ocean-record-heat-wave-el-nino-hurricane-climate-change\">warm phase of its temperature cycle</a>. A new <a href=\"https://cpo.noaa.gov/unintended-warming-how-reduced-ship-emissions-may-accelerate-climate-change/#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20new%20international%20shipping,reflecting%20sunlight%20back%20into%20space.\">air pollution regulation</a> for shipping went into effect as well. This drastically curbed the emissions of aerosols like sulfur particles. That improved air quality for breathing, but those pollutants had the side effect of dimming the sky and reflecting sunlight back into space. Without them, more energy from the sun made its way into the ocean, particularly along busy shipping routes, heating up the water below. Similarly, <a href=\"https://e360.yale.edu/features/aerosols-warming-climate-change\">recent reductions in air pollution from China</a> contributed to warming in the Pacific Ocean. Weaker air currents over the ocean also slowed evaporation and allowed heat to accumulate. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">The convergence of all these factors led the planet’s oceans to absorb an extraordinary amount of heat, pushing <a href=\"/climate/368324/hurricane-season-2024-gulf-mexico-ocean-warming\">water temperatures to record highs</a>. Hot ocean temperatures can lead to <a href=\"/climate/23801858/caribbean-heat-wave-dominica-ocean-marine-sea-coral-fish\">heat waves underwater</a> that can damage <a href=\"/down-to-earth/366763/bonaire-coral-reef-caribbean-climate-change\">critical ecosystems like coral reefs</a>. They’re also a key raw ingredient for <a href=\"/climate/378359/hurricane-climate-change-flood-helene-milton-warming\">tropical storms and hurricanes</a>. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Eventually, the pendulum is supposed to swing back and let the planet cool off a bit. El Niño started to fade last year, setting the stage for its cool counterpart, <a href=\"/climate/24145756/la-nina-2024-el-nino-heat-hurricane-record-temperature-pacific\">La Niña</a>. This tends to lower global air temperatures. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">So why was this past January still so hot around the world? </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">“It would seem that the developing La Niña is not yet mature enough to overcome the warmth associated with widespread marine heatwave conditions around the globe,” said <a href=\"https://psl.noaa.gov/people/dillon.amaya/\">Dillon Amaya</a>, a research scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in an email. “The equatorial Pacific crossed our usual La Niña threshold for the first time in January, but those anomalies need to be at least that strong for four more consecutive months before a La Niña is officially declared.”</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Oceans act like thermal batteries, and since they absorbed so much heat over the past two years, they are still running hot and raising global air temperatures. Amaya noted that <a href=\"https://psl.noaa.gov/marine-heatwaves/#report\">28 percent of Earth’s oceans</a> experienced heat wave conditions in December 2024, when that number would typically be only 10 percent. NOAA’s forecast shows that about 26 percent of the oceans will experience heat waves into March, which will likely lead above-average air temperatures to persist across much of the world. Early measurements and models also show that this year’s La Niña isn’t going to be very strong and likely won’t cause big changes in weather patterns in the opposite direction. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Then why was there so much bitter, icy weather across the United States this year? </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Frigid air from the Arctic spilled down across North America in January as a <a href=\"/climate/393566/winter-storm-blair-polar-vortex-climate-change\">wobbly jet stream and oblong polar vortex</a> stretched southward from the North Pole. Oddly, warming likely played a role here as well. The Arctic is heating up to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00498-3\">four times faster</a> than the rest of the planet. As its temperatures rise, they weaken the atmospheric currents that contain its cold weather to high latitudes. Air that is warm by Arctic standards is still chilly compared to air at lower latitudes, so it causes cold snaps when it leaks out. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1\">Even with these sudden temperature plunges, the overall trend is that <a href=\"/climate/24043213/polar-vortex-extreme-cold-winter-climate-change-warming\">winters are warming up</a> faster than summers. As the climate changes, the knock-on effects won’t scale linearly, and as temperatures head into uncharted territory, there will be more surprises. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\"></p>, <p class=\"mr4kuae\"><span class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup\">Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.</span></p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1neefeej _1neefeee _1neefeef\">Exclusive: The US Fish and Wildlife Service has frozen millions of dollars, imperiling animals abroad.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1neefeej _1neefeee _1neefeef\">California’s last resort for fire insurance may fail.

In a quarter-century of using bags from Eagle Creek—an independent company—I’ve only actually thrown away one of them.

      "The strangest book I own is the Secret Museum of Mankind. It is a thick book of a thousand grainy black and white photos of tribal people taken over a hundred years ago. The fuzzy photos show costumes and dress, strange tattoos and scarifications, topless women, bizarre religious rituals, cruel punishments, and esoteric practices of cults. The book has no author, no credits, no copyrights, no page numbers, and has the appearance of being reproduced many times without permission. There’s no text in the book except for short unreliable captions that are dated and full of prejudices of that time. I keep coming back to the photos which capture worlds long gone. Despite its titillating gaze, you can see the texture of everyday life for most people with unvarnished realism in a world before electricity, coal, and manufacturing—all revealed with a directness I have not seen published elsewhere. The book is most useful to anyone interested in clothes and fashion as every bit of clothing here was handmade and custom. While used copies are not hard to find, a good digital version has been scanned by Ian Macky, with added index and image grid, and is free here. — KK\n",

The A/B InBev beer conglomerate stocks the sports stadium stands with its own Bud, Corona, Stella, Beck’s, Leffe, Labatt, Hoegaarden, Goose Island, and a potential 390 others. In travel, Expedia, Hotels.com, Orbitz, Travelocity, CheapTickets, ebookers, Vrbo, and Hotwire are all part of the same company.

The fuzzy photos show costumes and dress, strange tattoos and scarifications, topless women, bizarre religious rituals, cruel punishments, and esoteric practices of cults. The book has no author, no credits, no copyrights, no page numbers, and has the appearance of being reproduced many times without permission. There’s no text in the book except for short unreliable captions that are dated and full of prejudices of that time. I keep coming back to the photos which capture worlds long gone. Despite its titillating gaze, you can see the texture of everyday life for most people with unvarnished realism in a world before electricity, coal, and manufacturing—all revealed with a directness I have not seen published elsewhere.

Over the last week, I faced a uniquely challenging visit: returning to Los Angeles where my parents lost my childhood home and much of my hometown community burned to the ground. As a climate journalist writing for a global audience, I am always keen to drive home that these are not isolated incidents. While you may be isolated from the worst extremes, the effects of climate change will eventually hit us all. For me, and dozens of my friends and neighbors, “eventually” came last week. I am still processing the loss, and I expect that I will write more about the fires from a personal perspective in the coming weeks. But this week I want to offer a quick reflection on the wildfires and the usual topic of this column: the intersection of business and climate. The truth is that perhaps no recent climate-related event better illustrates the myriad ways that climate change will affect American businesses and the U.S. economy.  The first place to begin understanding the impact is the headline numbers. Early estimates of the damage and economic costs have come in the $250 billion range, which would make the disaster the costliest in U.S. history. That includes the price tag of expensive Los Angeles real estate as well as the knock on effects in areas like employment and health.          While a quarter of a trillion dollars is an enormous sum, it would be easy to see it as a modest headwind in a $30 trillion U.S. economy. Indeed, economists at Goldman Sachs see the event as only a 0.2 percentage point drag on U.S. growth in the first-quarter. The wildfires will inevitably have an inflationary effect—as they lead to new demand for everything from construction materials to new cars—but economists say that at a national level those effects will be relatively minor.But headline numbers can obscure the far-reaching and perhaps unexpected effects for specific companies and even industries more broadly. While communities vulnerable to climate-linked events will face the brunt of rising costs, events like the California wildfires can raise costs nationwide. Take a look at the utility sector. The price of shares in Edison International, which owns the utility servicing much of Southern California, fell nearly 30% on fears that the utility will be found responsible for sparking the Eaton Fire. Across the country, such fears have weighed heavily on the sector as investors wonder which utility may be next. Indeed, a study in the journal Nature Sustainability evaluated the economic effects of California wildfires in 2018 and found that the majority of economic impact came from indirect losses, oftentimes in places and industries seemingly distant from the fires. Those losses include somewhat obvious effects like the health consequences of air pollution as well as less obvious ones like the disruption to California’s chemical manufacturing industry. More than half of “indirect losses” caused by more than a dozen wildfires that year occurred outside the state, according to the study.   The far-reaching nature of climate-related events will only grow with time as their frequency increases and severity worsens. It may be easy to dismiss a 0.2 percentage point effect on growth, but what happens when you have such an event multiple times within one year? And, more to the point, what happens when such an event is in the backyard of your home or business?  For as long as I’ve been writing about climate change, I’ve heard politicians say that more catastrophic climate-linked events will eventually wake up policymakers and the public into action. Watching the response to the wildfires with fingers pointed in every direction, I’m skeptical. But I hope I’m wrong. I hope that an acknowledgement of the far-reaching effects of these events can at least get people thinking differently. More Must-Reads from TIMEInside Elon Musk’s War on WashingtonWhy Do More Young Adults Have Cancer? Colman Domingo Leads With Radical Love11 New Books to Read in FebruaryHow to Get Better at Doing Things AloneCecily Strong on Goober the ClownColumn: The Rise of America’s BroligarchyIntroducing the 2025 ClosersWrite to Justin Worland at justin.worland@time.comEdit PostHomeU.S.PoliticsWorldHealthBusinessTechPersonal Finance by TIME StampedShopping by TIME StampedFuture of Work by CharterEntertainmentIdeasScienceHistorySportsMagazineThe TIME VaultTIME For KidsTIMECO2CouponsTIME EdgeVideoMastheadNewslettersSubscribeDigital MagazineGive a GiftShop the TIME StoreCareersModern Slavery StatementPress RoomTIME StudiosU.S. & Canada Customer CareGlobal Help CenterContact the EditorsReprints and PermissionsSite MapMedia KitSupplied Partner ContentAbout Us© 2024 TIME USA, LLC.

      "Skip to main contentScientific AmericanOpinionJanuary 21, 20254 min readRenew Support for Renewable EnergyRenewable energy is crucial to the U.S. economy and the environmentBy The Editors edited by Megha SatyanarayanaWind turbines create renewable energy and are part of the fastest growing sector of electricity production in the U.S. Seen here is a wind farm in northern California’s Altamont Pass. Billy Hustace/Getty ImagesIncoming president Donald Trump and his administration have called warnings about climate change “alarmist,” and they have pledged to further expand oil and natural gas production. But there are important reasons for the U.S. to expand its use of clean energy technologies as well. Renewable energy not only cuts carbon emissions; it is an economic juggernaut.Renewable energy is growing faster than any other electricity source in the U.S., according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Globally, the market for these technologies is projected to rise from $700 billion in 2023 to more than $2 trillion by 2035.China dominates the worldwide markets for solar panels, electric vehicles, and batteries able to store energy when the sun or wind is down. If the U.S. does not support domestic renewable-energy industries, China’s dominance will only grow, with the European Union and India poised to also rise. If the Trump administration stops federal support for renewables or, worse, discourages them, the nation will both continue to degrade its environment and miss a profound economic opportunity. “This is ceding the future,” says Steven Cohen, director of Columbia University’s master’s program in sustainability management.On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.More renewables also means greater U.S. energy independence, and right now it means more support for domestic industries. According to an August 2024 report by the Rhodium Group and partners, the five states receiving the most clean energy and clean technology dollars from the Inflation Reduction Act, relative to the size of their economy, are all red or “swing” states: Nevada, Wyoming, Arizona, Tennessee and Montana. There is plenty more cash from the Inflation Reduction Act to hand out—unless the Trump administration dismantles the legislation.That would be a mistake. A rise in renewable energy does not mean a fall in oil or natural gas. U.S. production is growing there, too, and overall power demand is increasing. We’re not proposing a future free of fossil fuels. Major energy transitions take time. But as numerous studies have shown, more fossil-fuel consumption makes climate change, air and water pollution, and public health worse. Ultimately renewable energy costs less, and the cheaper technology always wins. Some U.S. states have gotten this message: Texas, the oil center of the country, now produces more wind power than any other state. The market for clean technologies is “increasingly catching up with the markets for fossil fuels,” Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, noted in an October 2024 release of the agency’s latest study.A common refrain from critics is that U.S. renewable-energy industries depend on subsidies. Truth is, that’s how canals, roads, trains, steel, aluminum, corn, soybeans and space rockets developed, too. And even though the U.S. oil and gas industries are more than a century old, they still get huge subsidies as well. China subsidizes its renewable-­tech­nol­o­gy industries—and for the rest of the world, that’s positive. Inexpensive Chinese solar panels, electric cars and wind turbines help to accelerate the energy transition worldwide. Energy transitions are costly, notes Jeffrey Frankel, professor of capital formation and growth at Harvard University and a research ­as­­sociate at the U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research. So, he asks, why not let Chinese taxpayers foot a subsidy bill that helps to spread renewable energy everywhere?Capitol Hill’s view of the renewable-­energy industry may be influenced by the strong fossil-fuel industry lobby. But the big users of renewable energy have strong influence, too. More than 70 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product now comes from the service sector, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, and it is gaining in political power. Meta is the largest buyer of solar panels in the country. The service sector consumes gobs of energy; witness the meteoric rise in energy demand from artificial-­intelligence data centers. These com­­panies want the cheapest power prices, and renewables offer them. “Money tends to dominate over ideology,” Cohen says.Most people recognize that climate change is real and a result of our own actions, notably, burning fossil fuels, which they increasingly see as harmful. According to a large 2023 survey by the Pew Research Center, “59 percent [of Americans] think that air and water quality would get better if the U.S. greatly reduced fossil-­fuel energy production and increased production from renewable sources.” The survey also found that “67 percent of Americans say the U.S. should prioritize developing alternative energy sources, such as wind, solar and hydrogen technology, while 32 percent say the priority should be expanding the exploration and production of oil, coal and natural gas.”A cultural shift is underway, in part because many more people in the U.S. are experiencing extreme weather: most recently, unprecedented flooding in North Carolina from Hurricane Helene and rec­ord-breaking drought killing crops across many states. Homeowners in some coastal states cannot get flood insurance. These experiences put millions of Americans at great risk of death, injury or financial ruin. People can see that the scientific predictions have been correct all along. They are increasingly worried about their health and their children’s well-being. They are feeling the human impact.Supporting renewable energy is not asking anyone to do without—we won’t have to give up our trucks or air conditioners. It provides an opportunity to reduce the threats we all face and to lead in a rapidly expanding, thriving economy.Rights & PermissionsMore by The EditorsThis article was originally published with the title “Renew Support for Renewable Energy” in Scientific American Magazine Vol. 332 No. 2 (February 2025), p. 68doi:10.1038/scientificamerican022025-66fkydgUwU5VfcVjwtWlmwView This IssueExpand Your World with ScienceLearn and share the most exciting discoveries, innovations and ideas shaping our world today.SubscribeSign up for our newslettersSee the latest storiesRead the latest issueGive a Gift SubscriptionFollow Us:Return & Refund PolicyAboutPress RoomFAQsContact UsInternational EditionsAdvertiseAccessibility StatementTerms of UsePrivacy PolicyCalifornia Consumer Privacy StatementUse of cookies/Do not sell my dataScientific American is part of Springer Nature, which owns or has commercial relations with thousands of scientific publications (many of them can be found at www.springernature.com/us).

But there are important reasons for the U.S. to expand its use of clean energy technologies as well. Renewable energy not only cuts carbon emissions; it is <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/renewable-energy-is-charging-ahead/\">an economic juggernaut</a>.</p>, <p class=\"\" data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\">Renewable energy is growing faster than any other electricity source in the U.S., according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Globally, the market for these technologies is projected to rise from $700 billion in 2023 to more than $2 trillion by 2035.</p>, <p class=\"\" data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\">China dominates the worldwide markets for solar panels, electric vehicles, and batteries able to store energy when the sun or wind is down. If the U.S. does not support domestic renewable-energy industries, China’s dominance will only grow, with the European Union and India poised to also rise. If the Trump administration stops federal support for renewables or, worse, discourages them, the nation will both continue to degrade its environment and miss a profound economic opportunity. “This is ceding the future,” says Steven Cohen, director of Columbia University’s master’s program in sustainability management.</p>, <p>If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by<!-- --> <a href=\"/getsciam/\">subscribing</a>.

According to an August 2024 report by the Rhodium Group and partners, the five states receiving the most clean energy and clean technology dollars from the Inflation Reduction Act, relative to the size of their economy, are all red or “swing” states: Nevada, Wyoming, Arizona, Tennessee and Montana. There is plenty more cash from the Inflation Reduction Act to hand out—unless the Trump administration dismantles the legislation.</p>, <p class=\"\" data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\">That would be a mistake. A rise in renewable energy does not mean a fall in oil or natural gas. U.S. production is growing there, too, and overall power demand is increasing. We’re not proposing a future free of fossil fuels. Major energy transitions take time. But as numerous studies have shown, more fossil-fuel consumption makes climate change, air and water pollution, and public health worse. Ultimately renewable energy costs less, and the cheaper technology always wins. Some U.S. states have gotten this message: Texas, the oil center of the country, now produces more wind power than any other state. The market for clean technologies is “increasingly catching up with the markets for fossil fuels,” Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, noted in an October 2024 release of the agency’s latest study.</p>, <p class=\"\" data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\">A common refrain from critics is that U.S. renewable-energy industries depend on subsidies. Truth is, that’s how canals, roads, trains, steel, aluminum, corn, soybeans and space rockets developed, too. And even though the U.S. oil and gas industries are more than a century old, they still get huge subsidies as well. China subsidizes its renewable-­tech­nol­o­gy industries—and for the rest of the world, that’s positive. Inexpensive Chinese solar panels, electric cars and wind turbines help to accelerate the energy transition worldwide. Energy transitions are costly, notes Jeffrey Frankel, professor of capital formation and growth at Harvard University and a research ­as­­sociate at the U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research. So, he asks, why not let Chinese taxpayers foot a subsidy bill that helps to spread renewable energy everywhere?</p>, <p class=\"\" data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\">Capitol Hill’s view of the renewable-­energy industry may be influenced by the strong fossil-fuel industry lobby. But the big users of renewable energy have strong influence, too. More than 70 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product now comes from the service sector, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, and it is gaining in political power. Meta is the largest buyer of solar panels in the country. The service sector consumes gobs of energy; witness the meteoric rise in energy demand from artificial-­intelligence data centers. These com­­panies want the cheapest power prices, and renewables offer them. “Money tends to dominate over ideology,” Cohen says.</p>, <p class=\"\" data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\">Most people recognize that climate change is real and a result of our own actions, notably, burning fossil fuels, which they increasingly see as harmful. According to a large 2023 survey by the Pew Research Center, “59 percent [of Americans] think that air and water quality would get better if the U.S. greatly reduced fossil-­fuel energy production and increased production from renewable sources.” The survey also found that “67 percent of Americans say the U.S. should prioritize developing alternative energy sources, such as wind, solar and hydrogen technology, while 32 percent say the priority should be expanding the exploration and production of oil, coal and natural gas.”</p>, <p class=\"\" data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\">A cultural shift is underway, in part because many more people in the U.S. are experiencing extreme weather: most recently, unprecedented flooding in North Carolina from Hurricane Helene and rec­ord-breaking drought killing crops across many states. Homeowners in some coastal states cannot get flood insurance. These experiences put millions of Americans at great risk of death, injury or financial ruin. People can see that the scientific predictions have been correct all along. They are increasingly worried about their health and their children’s well-being. They are feeling the human impact.</p>, <p class=\"\" data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\">Supporting renewable energy is not asking anyone to do without—we won’t have to give up our trucks or air conditioners. It provides an opportunity to reduce the threats we all face and to lead in a rapidly expanding, thriving economy.</p>, <p class=\"footerText-PzHcy\">Learn and share the most exciting discoveries, innovations and ideas shaping our world today.</p>, <p class=\"footerSocialMedia-7KIIV\">Follow Us:<a alt=\"Instagram link\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/scientific_american/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Instagram\"><svg class=\"footerSocialIcon-UQyIx\" viewbox=\"0 0 448 512\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M224.1 141c-63.6 0-114.9 51.3-114.9 114.9s51.3 114.9 114.9 114.9S339 319.5 339 255.9 287.7 141 224.1 141zm0 189.6c-41.1 0-74.7-33.5-74.7-74.7s33.5-74.7 74.7-74.7 74.7 33.5 74.7 74.7-33.6 74.7-74.7 74.7zm146.4-194.3c0 14.9-12 26.8-26.8 26.8-14.9 0-26.8-12-26.8-26.8s12-26.8 26.8-26.8 26.8 12 26.8 26.8zm76.1 27.2c-1.7-35.9-9.9-67.7-36.2-93.9-26.2-26.2-58-34.4-93.9-36.2-37-2.1-147.9-2.1-184.9 0-35.8 1.7-67.6 9.9-93.9 36.1s-34.4 58-36.2 93.9c-2.1 37-2.1 147.9 0 184.9 1.7 35.9 9.9 67.7 36.2 93.9s58 34.4 93.9 36.2c37 2.1 147.9 2.1 184.9 0 35.9-1.7 67.7-9.9 93.9-36.2 26.2-26.2 34.4-58 36.2-93.9 2.1-37 2.1-147.8 0-184.8zM398.8 388c-7.8 19.6-22.9 34.7-42.6 42.6-29.5 11.7-99.5 9-132.1 9s-102.7 2.6-132.1-9c-19.6-7.8-34.7-22.9-42.6-42.6-11.7-29.5-9-99.5-9-132.1s-2.6-102.7 9-132.1c7.8-19.6 22.9-34.7 42.6-42.6 29.5-11.7 99.5-9 132.1-9s102.7-2.6 132.1 9c19.6 7.8 34.7 22.9 42.6 42.6 11.7 29.5 9 99.5 9 132.1s2.7 102.7-9 132.1z\"></path></svg></a><a alt=\"YouTube link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/SciAmerican\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"YouTube\"><svg class=\"footerSocialIcon-UQyIx\" viewbox=\"0 0 576 512\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M549.655 124.083c-6.281-23.65-24.787-42.276-48.284-48.597C458.781 64 288 64 288 64S117.22 64 74.629 75.486c-23.497 6.322-42.003 24.947-48.284 48.597-11.412 42.867-11.412 132.305-11.412 132.305s0 89.438 11.412 132.305c6.281 23.65 24.787 41.5 48.284 47.821C117.22 448 288 448 288 448s170.78 0 213.371-11.486c23.497-6.321 42.003-24.171 48.284-47.821 11.412-42.867 11.412-132.305 11.412-132.305s0-89.438-11.412-132.305zm-317.51 213.508V175.185l142.739 81.205-142.739 81.201z\"></path></svg></a><a alt=\"Threads link\" href=\"https://www.threads.net/@scientific_american\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Threads\"><svg class=\"footerSocialIcon-UQyIx\" viewbox=\"0 0 448 512\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M331.5 235.7c2.2.9 4.2 1.9 6.3 2.8c29.2 14.1 50.6 35.2 61.8 61.4c15.7 36.5 17.2 95.8-30.3 143.2c-36.2 36.2-80.3 52.5-142.6 53h-.3c-70.2-.5-124.1-24.1-160.4-70.2c-32.3-41-48.9-98.1-49.5-169.6v-.5c.5-71.5 17.1-128.6 49.4-169.6c36.3-46.1 90.3-69.7 160.5-70.2h.3c70.3.5 124.9 24 162.3 69.9c18.4 22.7 32 50 40.6 81.7l-40.4 10.8c-7.1-25.8-17.8-47.8-32.2-65.4c-29.2-35.8-73-54.2-130.5-54.6c-57 .5-100.1 18.8-128.2 54.4C72.1 146.1 58.5 194.3 58 256c.5 61.7 14.1 109.9 40.3 143.3c28 35.6 71.2 53.9 128.2 54.4c51.4-.4 85.4-12.6 113.7-40.9c32.3-32.2 31.7-71.8 21.4-95.9c-6.1-14.2-17.1-26-31.9-34.9c-3.7 26.9-11.8 48.3-24.7 64.8c-17.1 21.8-41.4 33.6-72.7 35.3c-23.6 1.3-46.3-4.4-63.9-16c-20.8-13.8-33-34.8-34.3-59.3c-2.5-48.3 35.7-83 95.2-86.4c21.1-1.2 40.9-.3 59.2 2.8c-2.4-14.8-7.3-26.6-14.6-35.2c-10-11.7-25.6-17.7-46.2-17.8h-.7c-16.6 0-39 4.6-53.3 26.3l-34.4-23.6c19.2-29.1 50.3-45.1 87.8-45.1h.8c62.6.4 99.9 39.5 103.7 107.7l-.2.2zm-156 68.8c1.3 25.1 28.4 36.8 54.6 35.3c25.6-1.4 54.6-11.4 59.5-73.2c-13.2-2.9-27.8-4.4-43.4-4.4c-4.8 0-9.6.1-14.4.4c-42.9 2.4-57.2 23.2-56.2 41.8z\"></path></svg></a><a alt=\"Facebook link\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ScientificAmerican\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Facebook\"><svg class=\"footerSocialIcon-UQyIx\" viewbox=\"0 0 320 512\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M279.14 288l14.22-92.66h-88.91v-60.13c0-25.35 12.42-50.06 52.24-50.06h40.42V6.26S260.43 0 225.36 0c-73.22 0-121.08 44.38-121.08 124.72v70.62H22.89V288h81.39v224h100.17V288z\"></path></svg></a><a alt=\"RSS feed\" href=\"/platform/syndication/rss/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"RSS feed\"><svg class=\"footerSocialIcon-UQyIx\" viewbox=\"0 0 448 512\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M0 64C0 46.3 14.3 32 32 32c229.8 0 416 186.2 416 416c0 17.7-14.3 32-32 32s-32-14.3-32-32C384 253.6 226.4 96 32 96C14.3 96 0 81.7 0 64zM0 416a64 64 0 1 1 128 0A64 64 0 1 1 0 416zM32 160c159.1 0 288 128.9 288 288c0 17.7-14.3 32-32 32s-32-14.3-32-32c0-123.7-100.3-224-224-224c-17.7 0-32-14.3-32-32s14.3-32 32-32z\"></path></svg></a></p>, <p>Scientific American is part of Springer Nature, which owns or has commercial relations with thousands of scientific publications (many of them can be found at www.springernature.com/us).

      "The study in Environmental Research Letters found that the rate of ocean warming has more than quadrupled over the past 40 years, driven by Earth’s growing energy imbalance — accounting for roughly 44 percent of the extra heat in recent El Niño years. Thanks to heat-trapping greenhouse gases and a decrease in reflectivity, the planet is absorbing more energy from the sun than is escaping back into space. Since 2010, according to the study, that disparity has doubled.“There’s been an uptick in that imbalance and that has led to an uptick in the rate of ocean warming,” said Christopher Merchant, a professor of ocean and earth observation at the University of Reading in the U.K. and the study’s lead author. \n",
      "By looking back through satellite observations since 1985 and developing a statistical model that isolated the trends in both ocean warming and Earth’s energy imbalance, the researchers found they were escalating in lockstep. According to Merchant, the study is possibly the first to connect the two phenomena over recent decades. “It’s a very tight correlation,” he said. \n",

      "This relationship is bad news for the oceans, which have absorbed some 90 percent of the excess warming from human activity. Some of that heat will continue to seep down into the planet’s depths, while some will cycle back up toward the surface and escape into the atmosphere. According to the study, the next 20 years could warm up the oceans more than the last 40. \n",
      "If you think of the oceans as a bath, Merchant says, it’s like the hot tap was only a trickle in the 1980s — but now, it’s been cranked up. “And what’s turning the tap more open, making the warming pick up speed, is an increase in greenhouse gases — carbon dioxide and methane — which are both still rising, largely from the fossil fuel industry,” he said.There are other factors turning up the heat. The El Niño pattern that began in 2023 added around 0.1 or 0.2 degrees Celsius, before the inverse La Niña pattern took over in December 2024. Another piece of the puzzle is the planet’s diminishing reflectivity, according to Brian McNoldy, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science. The ocean’s dark surface helps it absorb heat, whereas white clouds and aerosol particles in the atmosphere help bounce the sun’s radiation back into space. In 2020, the International Maritime Organization adopted a new rule to cut back on sulfur pollution from shipping fuel, but because the aerosol particles in emissions acted as a seed for clouds, the regulation had the unintended effect of dimming the marine layer of clouds that blanket the ocean.“So you get rid of a lot of those, and now more of the sun’s energy can be absorbed in the ocean instead of reflecting off clouds,” McNoldy said. According to Merchant, efforts to curb air pollution from factories in countries like China also had the side effect of cutting back reflective aerosols. \n",
      "The excess ocean warmth has had wide-ranging consequences. In April 2024, as the oceans started simmering, 77 percent of the world’s coral reefs became imperiled in the most extensive bleaching event on record, threatening the livelihoods of a billion people and a quarter of marine life. Changing ocean temperatures also shift weather patterns, potentially intensifying droughts, downpours, and storms alike.“Hurricanes love warmer water. So all other things be equal, a warmer ocean can produce stronger hurricanes with maybe more frequent instances of rapid intensification,” McNoldy said. Last September, Hurricane Helene slammed into Florida’s Gulf Coast after surging from a Category 1 to a Category 4 storm in a single day.\n",
      "“The oceans really set the pace for global warming for the Earth as a whole,” Merchant said. The knock-on effects — like wildfires, drought, and floods — will continue to escalate, too. “That really needs to be understood, but it also needs to filter through to governments that changes might be coming down the line faster than they’re currently assuming.”\n",

Since then, the bathwater-like conditions have killed corals in a record-breaking <a href=\"https://grist.org/science/coral-reefs-bleaching-climate-tipping-point/\">mass bleaching event</a>, <a href=\"https://grist.org/climate-energy/climate-change-atlantic-hurricanes-beryl-milton/\">fueled hurricanes</a>, and <a href=\"https://grist.org/food/alaska-snow-crab-vanish-st-paul-island/\">collapsed entire fisheries.</a></p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">The two years of heat have created <a href=\"https://grist.org/science/mysterious-x-factor-2023-heat-records/\">a scientific mystery</a>, with 450 straight days of record high global sea surface temperatures from April 2023 to July 2024 — a streak that exceeded climate scientists’ predictions even when accounting for climate change and the natural climate pattern known as El Niño. A study published on Tuesday by researchers at the University of Reading helps solve the puzzle and points to one prominent culprit: the sun. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">The <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/adaa8a\">study</a> in Environmental Research Letters found that the rate of ocean warming has more than quadrupled over the past 40 years, driven by Earth’s growing energy imbalance — accounting for roughly 44 percent of the extra heat in recent El Niño years. Thanks to heat-trapping <span class=\"tooltipsall tooltipsincontent classtoolTips1\">greenhouse gases</span> and a decrease in reflectivity, the planet is absorbing more energy from the sun than is escaping back into space. Since 2010, according to the study, that disparity has doubled.<br/><br/>“There’s been an uptick in that imbalance and that has led to an uptick in the rate of ocean warming,” said Christopher Merchant, a professor of ocean and earth observation at the University of Reading in the U.K. and the study’s lead author. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">By looking back through satellite observations since 1985 and developing a statistical model that isolated the trends in both ocean warming and Earth’s energy imbalance, the researchers found they were escalating in lockstep. According to Merchant, the study is possibly the first to connect the two phenomena over recent decades. “It’s a very tight correlation,” he said. </p>, <p>Grist thanks its sponsors. <a href=\"https://grist.org/advertising/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Become one</a>.</p>, <p class=\"modal-content__message\">To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider <a href=\"https://grist.org/how-to-whitelist-grist\" target=\"_blank\">disabling your ad-blocker</a> to allow ads on Grist. <a class=\"modal-content__link\" href=\"https://grist.org/how-to-whitelist-grist\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"modal-content__link-text\">Here's How</span><span class=\"icon-right-1\"></span></a></p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">This relationship is bad news for the oceans, which have absorbed some <a href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-ocean-heat-content\">90 percent</a> of the excess warming from human activity. Some of that heat will continue to seep down into the planet’s depths, while some will cycle back up toward the surface and <a href=\"https://e360.yale.edu/features/how_long_can_oceans_continue_to_absorb_earths_excess_heat\">escape into the atmosphere.</a> According to the study, the next 20 years could warm up the oceans more than the last 40. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">If you think of the oceans as a bath, Merchant says, it’s like the hot tap was only a trickle in the 1980s — but now, it’s been cranked up. “And what’s turning the tap more open, making the warming pick up speed, is an increase in greenhouse gases — carbon dioxide and <span class=\"tooltipsall tooltipsincontent classtoolTips3\">methane</span> — which are both still rising, largely from the fossil fuel industry,” he said.<br/><br/>There are other factors turning up the heat. The El Niño pattern that began in 2023 added around 0.1 or 0.2 degrees Celsius, before the inverse La Niña pattern took over in December 2024. <br/><br/>Another piece of the puzzle is the planet’s diminishing reflectivity, according to Brian McNoldy, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science. The ocean’s dark surface helps it absorb heat, whereas white clouds and aerosol particles in the atmosphere help bounce the sun’s radiation back into space. In 2020, the International Maritime Organization adopted a new rule to cut back on sulfur pollution from shipping fuel, but because the aerosol particles in emissions acted as a seed for clouds, the regulation had the unintended effect of dimming the marine layer of clouds that blanket the ocean.<br/><br/>“So you get rid of a lot of those, and now more of the sun’s energy can be absorbed in the ocean instead of reflecting off clouds,” McNoldy said. According to Merchant, efforts to curb air pollution from factories in countries like China also had the side effect of <a href=\"https://e360.yale.edu/features/aerosols-warming-climate-change#:~:text=New%20research%20indicates%20that%20the,is%20also%20heating%20the%20atmosphere.\">cutting back reflective aerosols</a>. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">The excess ocean warmth has had wide-ranging consequences. In April 2024, as the oceans started simmering, 77 percent of the world’s coral reefs became imperiled in the most extensive bleaching event on record, <a href=\"https://grist.org/science/coral-reefs-bleaching-climate-tipping-point/\">threatening the livelihoods of a billion people and a quarter of marine life</a>. Changing ocean temperatures also shift weather patterns, potentially intensifying droughts, downpours, and storms alike.<br/><br/>“Hurricanes love warmer water. So all other things be equal, a warmer ocean can produce stronger hurricanes with maybe more frequent instances of rapid intensification,” McNoldy said. Last September, Hurricane Helene slammed into Florida’s Gulf Coast after surging from a Category 1 to a Category 4 storm in a single day.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“The oceans really set the pace for global warming for the Earth as a whole,” Merchant said. The knock-on effects — like wildfires, drought, and floods — will continue to escalate, too. “That really needs to be understood, but it also needs to filter through to governments that changes might be coming down the line faster than they’re currently assuming.”</p>, <p>Grist thanks its sponsors. <a href=\"https://grist.org/advertising/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Become one</a>.</p>, <p class=\"modal-content__message\">To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider <a href=\"https://grist.org/how-to-whitelist-grist\" target=\"_blank\">disabling your ad-blocker</a> to allow ads on Grist. <a class=\"modal-content__link\" href=\"https://grist.org/how-to-whitelist-grist\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"modal-content__link-text\">Here's How</span><span class=\"icon-right-1\"></span></a></p>, <p></p>, <p>A message from   <svg class=\"site-logo__logo\" viewbox=\"0 0 305 103\">\n",

Three miles from her home, those chickens — which now total around 7.5 million — are raised in massive warehouses on a sprawling complex run by Fremont Farms, which from the outside looks more like a maximum security prison than an egg farm.“Fremont is an egg factory,” Bittner told me when I visited her late last year. “It’s not a farm.” The US Environmental Protection Agency categorizes egg farms with 82,000 or more hens as “large”; Fremont has over 90 times as many birds, all packed into about 100 acres. Despite living three miles from the egg operation, Bittner is regularly reminded of its presence: “When they move manure, the stench is sickening. They will be moving manure now for the next few days, and it will be bad.” An egg farm that houses 7.5 million hens generates hundreds of millions of pounds of manure each year. The stench affects her in seemingly mundane ways that accumulate to degrade her overall quality of life. She can’t hang her clothes out to dry for fear the wind will shift and make them smell terrible. She often can’t open the windows, lest the smell invades her home. And the staggering amount of manure attracts tons of flies to the town, which spread their own manure around.“I had a new garage built while I was here, and it looked new for three days, and then there were so many fly specks [excrement] on the white edging and around the windows that it looked like it had been here for a decade,” she said.Joe Gough for VoxThe same week I visited Bittner, I also visited other factory farm towns in the region and quickly grew sick of the odor; I couldn’t imagine what it would be like to live with it every day. Bittner told me that years ago, during a permit hearing at the local county board of supervisors meeting, the Fremont Farms CEO at the time asserted that the operation doesn’t smell and that no one ever complains. “From that day on, I have complained every time it smells,” she said. “This morning, before you came, I was on the phone.” Both the former and current CEOs have met with Bittner at her home, and while the meetings were cordial, she told me, neither seemed particularly sympathetic to the problems their company had wrought.Bittner also worries about what’s in the air she breathes. Hog and poultry barns are equipped with giant exhaust fans that push pollutants, such as ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, volatile organic compounds, and particulate matter, out into the atmosphere.Air pollution from animal farms is linked to almost eight times more premature deaths than coal-fired power plants, a 2021 study led by University of Minnesota researchers found. Other research has found that living near a factory farm is positively associated with risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia, and people who live near them report higher rates of headaches, depression, anger, and respiratory symptoms, such as asthma. “Owned by a group of family farms with a long legacy in egg production, our team makes environmentally conscious decisions each day to protect the land, air and water around our farm,” reads part of a statement provided to Vox by Fremont Farms, which declined an interview request for this story. “We are committed to responsible farming and we will continue to support the Malcom community as we have for decades.”What it’s like to live near a factory farmFuture Perfect fellow Sam Delgado traveled with Kenny Torella to report and film this story. She explains what it was like to see — and smell — America’s factory farm capital.\n",

      "Over the last 65 years, the US has nearly tripled annual meat production, and the number of animals raised for food each year surpassed 10 billion in 2022. At the same time, the number of farms has plummeted, as small- and mid-sized operations have given way to large factory farms — and increasingly, “mega” factory farms, like Fremont Farms — that now produce the vast majority of America’s meat, milk, and eggs.These massive facilities can far exceed the threshold for what the EPA considers a large animal farm by orders of magnitude. Their enormous scale enables them to produce more food on less land with a smaller carbon footprint on a per-pound basis, and at a lower price point, compared to traditional farms. But they also push environmental and public health boundaries with little to no repercussions. The mega factory farm is the inevitable consequence of decades of federal and state agricultural policy that has incentivized growth at all costs, with few guardrails in place to protect the people who live near them, like Carolyn Bittner, many of whom feel their health and quality of life has been sacrificed for corporate profit and cheap meat, milk, and eggs. With unceasing domestic and international demand for animal products, there’s no limit to how big the country’s factory farms will get — and how much damage they’ll do.How a mega factory farm could end up in your backyardHow so many animals, and the voluminous manure and noxious fumes they produce, can exist so close to people’s homes is the result of a complex web of federal, state, county, and local regulations — or lack thereof. In Iowa, for example, the nation’s top egg- and pork-producing state, agricultural operations are exempt from county zoning ordinances, and there are no limits on how many animals can be crammed inside a factory farm. Large farms can set up shop half a mile from homes, businesses, churches, and schools. Iowa’s agricultural zoning and permitting laws are written by the state legislature and carried out by the state’s Department of Natural Resources, each of which have close ties to Iowa’s powerful agribusiness lobby — as does Iowa’s governor and secretary of agriculture. Some environmentalists call Iowa a “sacrifice state,” where the health and well-being of its residents has been sacrificed to enrich large meat, milk, egg, and grain corporations.This is the fourth in a series of stories on how factory farming has shaped, and continues to impact, the US. Find the rest of the series and future installments here, and visit Vox’s Future Perfect section for more coverage of Big Ag. The stories in this series are supported by Animal Charity Evaluators, which received a grant from Builders Initiative.While Iowa produces more animal waste than any other state, many aren’t far behind, and every major agricultural state has similar policy regimes, political dynamics, and air and water quality issues.If there were regulations in place to prevent factory farms from polluting so much, their staggering animal populations and close proximity to people might be less of a concern, but there aren’t. The deregulation starts at the top, with the US Environmental Protection Agency, which enforces the Clean Air Act. But the agency has long said it doesn’t know how to measure pollutants on animal farms, so its authority there has barely been put to use.In 2005, the EPA said it would study the issue and finalize pollution measurement models in 2009, which it could then use to issue Clean Air Act permits in 2010 and get factory farm air pollution under control. Over 15 years later, it still hasn’t delivered.The agency declined an interview request for this story and didn’t answer several detailed questions. Over email, a spokesperson said that in November 2024, the agency posted draft air emission models for dairy, swine, and poultry operations. On its website, the EPA says it will finalize its emissions models by spring of this year. The agency didn’t provide insight as to when it will begin issuing Clean Air Act permits to animal farms.Factory farms are exempt from other federal air pollution laws, due to actions taken by the EPA and Congress.The factory farm industry also benefits from sweeping exemptions under the Clean Water Act, which has helped make agriculture the leading source of US water pollution. Much of the near 1 trillion pounds of manure produced each year by animal farms is applied to cropland as fertilizer, and when it rains, the manure — along with chemical fertilizers and pesticides — can leach into groundwater and contaminate the wells that people depend on for drinking water. It also runs off into rivers and streams, some of which water utilities source their water from, causing them to spend significant taxpayer resources to filter out pollutants.“More recently, there’s been concerns over longer-term health impacts that can develop through long-term exposure to nitrate [from manure and chemical fertilizers] in drinking water,” David Cwiertny, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Iowa, told me, pointing to studies on the potential links in association between nitrates in drinking water and bladder cancer, thyroid disorders, colorectal cancer, and birth defects.Joe Gough for VoxThose potential health effects worry Jennifer McNealy in Decatur County, Indiana, who lives 1.5 miles from Hulsbosch Dairy Farm, which has 8,000 cows — around 11.5 times the threshold for what the EPA considers a large dairy. Her tap water comes from wells, and while she hasn’t tested it for nitrate levels, she doesn’t drink it out of an abundance of caution.“I do not feel comfortable drinking my well water,” McNealy told me. She has reason to worry; a 2022 report by the nonprofit Environmental Integrity Project found that Indiana leads the country in polluted waterways, with agriculture as the top cause. In recent years, the EPA appears to have modestly increased its oversight of agricultural water pollution; in a few states it’s either sued individual factory farms or directed state officials to take action. But the agency has much more work ahead if it’s to see meaningful progress. While McNealy said the stench of manure from 8,000 cows is bad enough, there are also three hog farms with around 4,400 pigs apiece within a 2.5-mile radius of her home. The EPA considers a hog farm to be large if it houses 2,500 pigs. About three years ago, McNealy was diagnosed with asthma. “I can’t say that any one or the combination of these facilities has caused it; I can say that it aggravates it,” she told me.Pigs at Fair Oak Farms in Indiana (this is not the facility near McNealy’s home). AP Photo/M.L. JohnsonDairy cows at Fair Oak Farms in Indiana (this is not the facility near McNealy’s home). Fair Oak raises 36,000 cows, about 50 times the size of what the EPA considers a “large” farm. AP Photo/M.L. JohnsonLike Carolyn Bittner in Iowa, the smell of the factory farms near McNealy’s home erodes her quality of life. She takes the long way to work to avoid driving by the dairy and hog operations, and some days when she gets home, the stench is so bad she has to cover her mouth and nose with the top of her shirt or a scarf and run to the door. She bought a grill but ended up giving it away because she couldn’t host outdoor cookouts due to the unpredictability of the odors. Hulsbosch Dairy Farm didn’t respond to a request for comment.McNealy’s’s situation illustrates another problem of factory farm expansionism over the last few decades: Rural communities don’t only have to contend with the rise of mega factory farms, but also with increasing factory farm density, with numerous large farms concentrated in one area that ultimately has the same impact of living near one massive facility. Agricultural permitting regimes “don’t adequately look at the cumulative impacts of all of the surrounding operations, so there’s a huge gap there,” said Holly Bainbridge, a staff attorney with FarmSTAND, a legal advocacy organization that works to reduce the harms of industrialized agriculture. Other people I spoke with in Ohio, Minnesota, and Iowa complained of similar factory farm density in their community. “The smell just made you want to throw up,” Kim Gearhart, who formerly lived within a three-mile radius of around nine cattle operations — each of which he estimates had a little under 1,000 steer each at the time — in Edon, Ohio, told me.Cattle at a Schmuckers operation in Williams County, Ohio. This photo is from a source whose name is being withheld due to fear of retaliation.The operations are run by the Schmuckers, an Amish family with a beef empire of nearly 100,000 cattle concentrated around the Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio tri-state border. They raise the cattle for JBS, the world’s largest meat company, and the region — 85 miles west of the manure-imperiled Lake Erie — has been plagued with farm pollution as the family has expanded its empire.About 10 years ago, Gearhart and his wife moved several miles away to another part of Edon. “We moved over here, and I just thought … it’s out of sight, out of mind.” But about a year ago, the Schmucker family started a new cattle operation a quarter-mile from his new home, and they’re building two more, he said. “I have to keep the windows closed year-round. It’s just disgusting again.” Schmucker Family Farms didn’t respond to a request for comment. The right to farm, or the right to harm?With few policymakers or regulators looking out for them, people who live near factory farms might naturally take livestock operations to court, but even that right has been taken away. Every state has what’s called a “Right to Farm” law on the books, which protect farms from lawsuits over nuisances like odor, noise, and dust. Most of the laws came about in the 1970s and ’80s as city dwellers moved to the country, sometimes bringing complaints of agricultural pollution with them. Right to Farm laws have long been invoked as a means to protect small, independent farms and conserve a rural way of life, but food system reform advocates have nicknamed them “Right to Harm” laws, as they’ve been instrumental in both factory farm operators’ and large meat corporations’ efforts to beat back nuisance lawsuits. “Everyone has a right to use and enjoy their property” under common law, said David Muraskin, managing director for litigation at FarmSTAND. “What the Right to Farm laws have done is basically say, ‘If you move next to a farm, no, you don’t — that farm can screw you over however it wants.’” Almost two-thirds of states’ Right to Farm laws supersede municipal ordinances, meaning towns can’t implement their own regulations to limit factory farm pollution, such as placing a cap on the number of animals allowed per farm. “I don’t think it’s a good thing for states to strip communities of their capacity to self-govern,” Loka Ashwood, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Kentucky and co-author of a book on Right to Farm laws, told me. “I think it’s undemocratic.”While there are ongoing, long-term efforts to regulate farm pollution at the federal and state levels, campaigning on the ground against proposed factory farms before they can be built seems to be one of the few approaches that’s actually worked.As executive director of Jefferson County Farmers & Neighbors, Diane Rosenberg has been running local campaigns to oppose factory farm construction in southeast Iowa, and elsewhere in the state, for almost two decades. When a factory farm is proposed in her county, she sends out a letter to people living within a couple miles of where it’ll be built explaining the potential impact it might have on them and, if they have concerns, how to make their voice heard.Diane Rosenberg, executive director of Jefferson County Farmers & Neighbors, at Lake Darling State Park speaking about factory farming in Iowa. The lake has long been polluted by livestock manure and other farm runoff. Sam Delgado/Vox“Truthfully, [factory farms] are hard to stop, because Iowa does not give us a whole lot to work with,” Rosenberg told me. “We come up with a strategy to exert public pressure … and that can look like a lot of different things”: phone calls to the meat company or potential factory farm owner, letters to the editor, organizing public meetings, attending hearings, or placing local ads. That the county in which she primarily works — Jefferson County — has far fewer hogs than most surrounding counties is a testament to the power of community organizing, she says.Such campaigns may ultimately result in the proposed factory farm being built elsewhere, making it somebody else’s problem — what some would criticize as a form of NIMBYism. But after spending a few days in Iowa and Minnesota touring factory farm communities and hearing — and smelling — what it’s like to have millions of chickens or thousands of pigs as neighbors, I can’t blame them for using the only tool left at their disposal.Stopping factory farms isn’t easy, Rosenberg said, “but it’s possible — and it’s possible when people work together and they don’t give up.”Sam Delgado contributed reporting to this story.Correction, January 24, 4:15 pm: A previous version of this story misstated the university affiliation of a study on air pollution from animal farms.

Three miles from her home, those chickens — which now total around 7.5 million — are raised in massive warehouses on a sprawling complex run by Fremont Farms, which from the outside looks more like a maximum security prison than an egg farm.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">“Fremont is an egg factory,” Bittner told me when I visited her late last year. “It’s not a farm.” The US Environmental Protection Agency categorizes egg farms with 82,000 or more hens as “large”; Fremont has over 90 times as many birds, all packed into about 100 acres. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Despite living three miles from the egg operation, Bittner is regularly reminded of its presence: “When they move manure, the stench is sickening. They will be moving manure now for the next few days, and it will be bad.” An egg farm that houses 7.5 million hens generates hundreds of millions of pounds of manure each year. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">The stench affects her in seemingly mundane ways that accumulate to degrade her overall quality of life. She can’t hang her clothes out to dry for fear the wind will shift and make them smell terrible. She often can’t open the windows, lest the smell invades her home. And the staggering amount of manure attracts <a href=\"https://www.news-leader.com/story/opinion/2022/11/06/flies-are-the-new-state-animal-if-cafos-run-rampant/69613813007/\">tons of flies</a> to the town, which spread their own manure around.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">“I had a new garage built while I was here, and it looked new for three days, and then there were so many fly specks [excrement] on the white edging and around the windows that it looked like it had been here for a decade,” she said.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">The same week I visited Bittner, I also visited other factory farm towns in the region and quickly grew sick of the odor; I couldn’t imagine what it would be like to live with it every day. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Bittner told me that years ago, during a permit hearing at the local county board of supervisors meeting, the Fremont Farms CEO at the time asserted that the operation doesn’t smell and that no one ever complains. “From that day on, I have complained every time it smells,” she said. “This morning, before you came, I was on the phone.” Both the former and current CEOs have met with Bittner at her home, and while the meetings were cordial, she told me, neither seemed particularly sympathetic to the problems their company had wrought.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Bittner also worries about what’s in the air she breathes. Hog and poultry barns are equipped with giant exhaust fans that push <a href=\"https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/cafo_ch11.pdf\">pollutants</a>, such as ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, volatile organic compounds, and particulate matter, out into the atmosphere.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Air pollution from animal farms is linked to almost eight times more premature deaths than <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/05/10/farm-pollution-deaths/\">coal-fired power plants</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2013637118\">2021 study</a> led by University of Minnesota researchers found. Other research has found that living near a factory farm is positively associated with risk of <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32168021/\">non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia</a>, and people who live near them <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1440820/\">report</a> higher rates of headaches, depression, anger, and respiratory symptoms, such as <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412018320750\">asthma</a>. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">“Owned by a group of family farms with a long legacy in egg production, our team makes environmentally conscious decisions each day to protect the land, air and water around our farm,” reads part of a statement provided to Vox by Fremont Farms, which declined an interview request for this story. “We are committed to responsible farming and we will continue to support the Malcom community as we have for decades.”</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Future Perfect fellow Sam Delgado traveled with Kenny Torella to report and film this story.

At the same time, the number of farms has <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/chart-detail?chartId=58268\">plummeted</a>, as small- and mid-sized operations have given way to large factory farms — and increasingly, “mega” factory farms, like Fremont Farms — that now produce the <a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/us-factory-farming-estimates\">vast majority</a> of America’s meat, milk, and eggs.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">These massive facilities can far exceed the threshold for what the EPA considers a large animal farm by orders of magnitude. Their enormous scale enables them to produce more food on less land with a smaller carbon footprint on a per-pound basis, and at a lower price point, <a href=\"/future-perfect/393738/factory-farms-meat-dairy-production\">compared</a> to traditional farms. But they also push environmental and public health boundaries with little to no repercussions. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">The mega factory farm is the inevitable consequence of decades of federal and state agricultural policy that has incentivized growth at all costs, with few guardrails in place to protect the people who live near them, like Carolyn Bittner, many of whom feel their health and quality of life has been sacrificed for corporate profit and cheap meat, milk, and eggs. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">With unceasing domestic and international demand for animal products, there’s no limit to how big the country’s factory farms will get — and how much damage they’ll do.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">How so many animals, and the voluminous manure and noxious fumes they produce, can exist so close to people’s homes is the result of a complex web of federal, state, county, and local regulations — or lack thereof. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">In Iowa, for example, the nation’s top egg- and pork-producing state, agricultural operations are exempt from county zoning ordinances, and there are no limits on how many animals can be crammed inside a factory farm. Large farms can set up shop half a mile from homes, businesses, churches, and schools. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Iowa’s agricultural zoning and permitting laws are written by the state legislature and carried out by the state’s Department of Natural Resources, each of which have close ties to Iowa’s <a href=\"https://investigatemidwest.org/2021/10/07/the-iowa-farm-bureau-is-a-small-nonprofit-its-sitting-on-a-huge-business-empire/\">powerful agribusiness lobby</a> — as does <a href=\"/the-highlight/22344953/iowa-select-jeff-hansen-pork-farming\">Iowa’s governor</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nwestiowa.com/news/longtime-deputy-steps-up-as-secretary-of-agriculture/article_680ed944-310f-11e8-b12a-43627d5f9d15.html\">secretary of agriculture</a>. Some environmentalists call Iowa a “<a href=\"https://www.iaenvironment.org/newsroom/council-news/new-book-examines-environmental-issues-through-conversations-with-iowans-from-diverse-backgrounds-and-experiences\">sacrifice state</a>,” where the health and well-being of its residents has been sacrificed to enrich large meat, milk, egg, and grain corporations.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst6\">This is the fourth in a series of stories on how factory farming has shaped, and continues to impact, the US.

But the agency has <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2017-09/documents/_epaoig_20170919-17-p-0396.pdf\">long said</a> it doesn’t know how to measure pollutants on animal farms, so its authority there has barely been put to use.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">In 2005, the EPA said it would study the issue and finalize pollution measurement models in 2009, which it could then use to issue Clean Air Act permits in 2010 and get factory farm air pollution under control. Over 15 years later, it still hasn’t delivered.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">The agency declined an interview request for this story and didn’t answer several detailed questions. Over email, a spokesperson said that in November 2024, the agency posted draft air emission models for dairy, swine, and poultry operations. On its website, the EPA <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/afos-air/national-air-emissions-monitoring-study\">says</a> it will finalize its emissions models by spring of this year. The agency didn’t provide insight as to when it will begin issuing Clean Air Act permits to animal farms.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Factory farms are exempt from <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/food/2018/12/factory-farms-no-longer-have-to-report-their-air-emissions-that-could-be-dangerous-for-their-neighbors/\">other</a> federal air pollution <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/epcra/cercla-and-epcra-reporting-requirements-air-releases-hazardous-substances-animal-waste-farms#:~:text=This%20amendment%20added%20a%20reporting,while%20EPA%20considers%20next%20steps.\">laws</a>, due to actions taken by the EPA and Congress.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">The factory farm industry also benefits from sweeping exemptions under the Clean Water Act, which has helped make agriculture the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230316085421/https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/ehs/docs/understanding_cafos_nalboh.pdf\">leading source</a> of US water pollution. Much of the <a href=\"/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census\">near 1 trillion pounds of manure</a> produced each year by animal farms is applied to cropland as fertilizer, and when it rains, the manure — along with chemical fertilizers and pesticides — can leach into groundwater and contaminate the wells that people depend on for drinking water. It also runs off into rivers and streams, some of which water utilities source their water from, causing them to spend significant taxpayer resources to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/25/opinion/water-quality-agriculture.html\">filter out pollutants</a>.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">“More recently, there’s been concerns over longer-term health impacts that can develop through long-term exposure to nitrate [from manure and chemical fertilizers] in drinking water,” <a href=\"https://engineering.uiowa.edu/directory/david-cwiertny\">David Cwiertny</a>, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Iowa, told me, pointing to studies on the potential links in association between nitrates in drinking water and bladder cancer, thyroid disorders, colorectal cancer, and birth defects.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Those potential health effects worry Jennifer McNealy in Decatur County, Indiana, who lives 1.5 miles from Hulsbosch Dairy Farm, which has 8,000 cows — around 11.5 times the threshold for what the EPA considers a large dairy. Her tap water comes from wells, and while she hasn’t tested it for nitrate levels, she doesn’t drink it out of an abundance of caution.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">“I do not feel comfortable drinking my well water,” McNealy told me. She has reason to worry; a <a href=\"https://environmentalintegrity.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/CWA@50-report-EMBARGOED-3.17.22.pdf\">2022 report</a> by the nonprofit Environmental Integrity Project found that Indiana leads the country in polluted waterways, with agriculture as the top cause. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">In recent years, the EPA appears to have modestly <a href=\"https://www.thenewlede.org/2024/09/epa-battles-environmentalists-in-court-over-regulation-of-cafos-and-water-pollution/\">increased its oversight</a> of agricultural water pollution; in a few states it’s either sued individual factory farms or directed state officials to take action. But the agency has <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/rivers-streams-nitrogen-pollution-fertilizer-agriculture-farming-571eb54cb69cc06f43d5f1253e990337\">much more work</a> ahead if it’s to see meaningful progress. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">While McNealy said the stench of manure from 8,000 cows is bad enough, there are also three hog farms with around 4,400 pigs apiece within a 2.5-mile radius of her home. The EPA considers a hog farm to be large if it houses 2,500 pigs. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">About three years ago, McNealy was diagnosed with asthma. “I can’t say that any one or the combination of these facilities has caused it; I can say that it aggravates it,” she told me.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Like Carolyn Bittner in Iowa, the smell of the factory farms near McNealy’s home erodes her quality of life. She takes the long way to work to avoid driving by the dairy and hog operations, and some days when she gets home, the stench is so bad she has to cover her mouth and nose with the top of her shirt or a scarf and run to the door. She bought a grill but ended up giving it away because she couldn’t host outdoor cookouts due to the unpredictability of the odors. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Hulsbosch Dairy Farm didn’t respond to a request for comment.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">McNealy’s’s situation illustrates another problem of factory farm expansionism over the last few decades: Rural communities don’t only have to contend with the rise of mega factory farms, but also with increasing factory farm density, with numerous large farms concentrated in one area that ultimately has the same impact of living near one massive facility. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Agricultural permitting regimes “don’t adequately look at the cumulative impacts of all of the surrounding operations, so there’s a huge gap there,” said <a href=\"https://farmstand.org/team/holly-bainbridge/\">Holly Bainbridge</a>, a staff attorney with FarmSTAND, a legal advocacy organization that works to reduce the harms of industrialized agriculture. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Other people I spoke with in Ohio, Minnesota, and Iowa complained of similar factory farm density in their community. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">“The smell just made you want to throw up,” Kim Gearhart, who formerly lived within a three-mile radius of around nine cattle operations — each of which he estimates had a little under 1,000 steer each at the time — in Edon, Ohio, told me.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">The operations are run by <a href=\"https://investigatemidwest.org/2024/11/18/amish-farmers-partnership-with-beef-giant-jbs-produces-manure-mess/\">the Schmuckers,</a> an Amish family with a beef empire of nearly 100,000 cattle concentrated around the Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio tri-state border. They raise the cattle for JBS, the world’s largest meat company, and the region — 85 miles west of the <a href=\"https://civileats.com/2019/04/09/lake-erie-was-granted-legal-rights-could-it-change-the-farm-pollution-debate/\">manure-imperiled Lake Erie</a> — has been <a href=\"https://www.wtol.com/article/news/investigations/11-investigates/unregulated-growth-the-rise-of-cattle-farms-and-the-decline-of-water-quality-in-ohio-11-investigates/512-e2aaba3b-1c2e-4cdc-9c65-c499e2d11444\">plagued</a> with farm pollution as the family has expanded its empire.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">About 10 years ago, Gearhart and his wife moved several miles away to another part of Edon. “We moved over here, and I just thought … it’s out of sight, out of mind.” But about a year ago, the Schmucker family started a new cattle operation a quarter-mile from his new home, and they’re building two more, he said. “I have to keep the windows closed year-round. It’s just disgusting again.” </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Schmucker Family Farms didn’t respond to a request for comment. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">With few policymakers or regulators looking out for them, people who live near factory farms might naturally take livestock operations to court, but even that right has been taken away. Every state has what’s called a “<a href=\"http://nationalaglawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/RTF-Provision-overview.pdf\">Right to Farm</a>” law on the books, which protect farms from lawsuits over nuisances like odor, noise, and dust. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Most of the laws came about in the 1970s and ’80s as city dwellers moved to the country, sometimes bringing complaints of agricultural pollution with them. Right to Farm laws have long been invoked as a means to protect small, independent farms and conserve a rural way of life, but food system reform advocates have nicknamed them “<a href=\"https://righttoharm.film/\">Right to Harm</a>” laws, as they’ve been instrumental in both factory farm operators’ and large meat corporations’ efforts to beat back nuisance lawsuits. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">“Everyone has a right to use and enjoy their property” under common law, said <a href=\"https://farmstand.org/team/david-muraskin/\">David Muraskin</a>, managing director for litigation at FarmSTAND. “What the Right to Farm laws have done is basically say, ‘If you move next to a farm, no, you don’t — that farm can screw you over however it wants.’” </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Almost two-thirds of states’ Right to Farm laws supersede municipal ordinances, meaning towns can’t implement their own regulations to limit factory farm pollution, such as placing a cap on the number of animals allowed per farm. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">“I don’t think it’s a good thing for states to strip communities of their capacity to self-govern,” <a href=\"https://lokaashwood.com/\">Loka Ashwood</a>, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Kentucky and co-author of a <a href=\"https://uncpress.org/book/9781469674599/empty-fields-empty-promises/\">book</a> on Right to Farm laws, told me. “I think it’s undemocratic.”</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">While there are ongoing, long-term efforts to regulate farm pollution at the federal and state levels, campaigning on the ground against proposed factory farms before they can be built seems to be one of the few approaches that’s actually worked.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">As executive director of <a href=\"https://www.jfaniowa.org/\">Jefferson County Farmers &amp; Neighbors</a>, Diane Rosenberg has been running local campaigns to oppose factory farm construction in southeast Iowa, and elsewhere in the state, for almost two decades. When a factory farm is proposed in her county, she sends out a letter to people living within a couple miles of where it’ll be built explaining the potential impact it might have on them and, if they have concerns, how to make their voice heard.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">“Truthfully, [factory farms] are hard to stop, because Iowa does not give us a whole lot to work with,” Rosenberg told me. “We come up with a strategy to exert public pressure … and that can look like a lot of different things”: phone calls to the meat company or potential factory farm owner, letters to the editor, organizing public meetings, attending hearings, or placing local ads. That the county in which she primarily works — Jefferson County — has far fewer hogs than most surrounding counties is a testament to the power of community organizing, she says.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Such campaigns may ultimately result in the proposed factory farm being built elsewhere, making it somebody else’s problem — what some would criticize as a form of <a href=\"/future-perfect/377096/sonoma-county-denver-factory-farming-slaughterhouse-ban-ballot-measures\">NIMBYism</a>. But after spending a few days in Iowa and Minnesota touring factory farm communities and hearing — and smelling — what it’s like to have millions of chickens or thousands of pigs as neighbors, I can’t blame them for using the only tool left at their disposal.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Stopping factory farms isn’t easy, Rosenberg said, “but it’s possible — and it’s possible when people work together and they don’t give up.”</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\"><em>Sam Delgado contributed reporting to this story.</em></p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\"><em><strong>Correction, January 24, 4:15 pm: </strong>A previous version of this story misstated the university affiliation of a study on air pollution from animal farms.

      "More than three years ago, ProPublica spotlighted America’s “sacrifice zones,” where communities in the shadow of industrial facilities were being exposed to unacceptable amounts of toxic air pollution. Life in these places was an endless stream of burning eyes and suspicious smells, cancer diagnoses and unanswered pleas for help.\n",
      "The Biden administration took action in the years that followed, doling out fines, stepping up air monitoring and tightening emissions rules for one of the most extreme carcinogens. Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency requested a significant budget increase in part to issue scores of hazardous air pollution rules and fulfill its obligations under the Clean Air Act. Had the effort been successful, experts said, it could have made a meaningful difference.\n",
      "President Donald Trump threatens to dismantle the steps his predecessor took to curb pollution. In just over two weeks, the Trump administration has ordered a halt to proposed regulations, fired the EPA’s inspector general, frozen federal funding for community projects and launched a process that could force thousands of EPA employees from their jobs.\n",
      "So ProPublica set out to understand what modest reforms are now under threat and who will be left to safeguard these communities.\n",

      "Weaknesses of State Enforcement\n",
      "The first Trump administration told EPA staff to defer more to state agencies on environmental enforcement. But ProPublica has documented a long history of state failures to hold polluters accountable — mostly in areas where support for Trump is strong.\n",
      "“States generally do not have the resources, experience, equipment, nor the political will to quickly and effectively respond” to serious pollution complaints, Scott Throwe, a former senior enforcement official at the EPA, said in an email.\n",
      "In Pascagoula, Mississippi, complaints from residents rolled in to the state’s environmental agency for years as a nearby oil refinery, a shipbuilding plant and other facilities regularly released carcinogens like benzene and nickel, according to emissions reports the facilities sent to the EPA.\n",

      "The futility of the complaints became apparent when the nonprofit Thriving Earth Exchange learned in early 2023 that the scientific instruments state contractors had used in the neighborhood to investigate recent complaints weren’t sensitive enough to detect some of the worst chemicals at levels that could pose health risks. The instruments were designed to protect industrial workers during eight-hour workdays, not children and medically vulnerable people who need greater protections at home.\n",
      "“I don’t live in this house eight hours! I live here 24/7,” said resident Barbara Weckesser, who has complained to the state about the toxic air for more than a decade.\n",
      "Jan Schaefer, communications director for the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality, said the agency uses “scientifically sound methods and tools” to address complaints and that looking at just one episode omits “critical context and broader actions taken by the agency to address air quality concerns in Mississippi.”\n",
      "Before Trump’s inauguration, the EPA’s regional office said the state agency had applied for a grant to install air monitors, and data collection should begin this spring. The $625,000 long-term air monitoring effort could finally determine the source and scale of the pollution, but the data it produces isn’t “going to trigger something magical to happen,” said Barbara Morin, an air pollution analyst who advises the environmental agencies of eight northeastern states. Either the state or Trump’s EPA will need to analyze the data to see what’s causing the pollution and how to stop it, Morin said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost immediately after taking office, Trump ordered a freeze on all federal grants, including those at the EPA, sparking a legal battle. Nevertheless, Schaefer said the project’s schedule is on track.\n",
      "The EPA confirmed that similar activities in the tiny city of Verona, Missouri, where the agency had been cracking down on an industrial plant spewing a dangerous carcinogen, remain ongoing.\n",
      "While making an animal feed additive, the plant releases ethylene oxide, a colorless gas linked to leukemia and breast cancer.\n",
      "In response to a request from the city’s then-mayor, Joseph Heck, the state conducted a cancer survey of residents in 2022 and determined there wasn’t enough data for detailed analysis. That same year, the plant, operated by BCP Ingredients, leaked nearly 1,300 pounds of ethylene oxide, the EPA reported.\n",
      "The EPA intervened, setting up air monitoring in the town, fining the company $300,000 and ordering it to install equipment to remove 99.95% of the ethylene oxide coming out of a particular smokestack. (BCP Ingredients didn’t return a request for comment.) “The EPA has done a lot more than I think the state can ever do,” said Heck, whose partner died of cancer in 2022. Crystal Payne was in complete remission from breast cancer before they moved to Verona, Heck said, but within a year it came back and spread to her brain and her liver.\n",
      "A spokesperson with the Missouri Department of Natural Resources said the EPA used its authority under the federal Clean Air Act to compel the company to update its pollution-cutting equipment after the spill. He said the state lacks the power to do that.\n",
      "“Texas Is Extremely Industry Friendly”\n",
      "\n",
      "For years, a facility that sterilizes medical equipment in Laredo, Texas, released more ethylene oxide into the air than any other industrial plant in the country, according to emission reports the facility submitted to the EPA.\n",
      "Nearly 130,000 nearby residents, including more than 37,000 children, faced an elevated lifetime cancer risk, a ProPublica and Texas Tribune investigation found. The parents of two children diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia, a cancer linked to ethylene oxide exposure, recounted their ordeal and said they had no idea about the risks.\n",
      "A statement from Midwest Sterilization Corporation, which operates the Laredo plant, said the company “meets or exceeds all federal and state law requirements” and performs the “important job” of sterilizing medical equipment, which “saves lives.”\n",
      "After the EPA released a report in 2016 on the dangers of ethylene oxide, Texas’ environmental agency conducted its own review of the federal study. The state concluded that people could safely inhale the chemical at concentrations thousands of times higher than the EPA’s safe limit.\n",
      "The state then passed a rule that meant that polluters didn’t need to lower their emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Richard Richter, a spokesperson for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, said the agency conducted an in-depth analysis that “led to the conclusion that there was inadequate evidence to support” a link between ethylene oxide and breast cancer.\n",
      "Scientists told ProPublica that the state agency reached that verdict only after wrongfully excluding studies that linked ethylene oxide to breast cancer and using a flawed analysis of the data EPA relied on.\n",
      "The state is the nation’s top ethylene oxide polluter and home to 26 facilities that emit ethylene oxide, according to ProPublica’s 2021 analysis of EPA data from 2014 through 2018.\n",
      "“Texas is extremely industry friendly,” said Tricia Cortez, executive director of the nonprofit Rio Grande International Study Center.\n",
      "Cortez said deferring more responsibility to the states “would be disastrous for normal everyday people. … Why should it matter how much you’re protected based on your state’s affiliation? People exposed to something so horrible and cancer-causing should have the same protection everywhere.”\n",
      "Representatives for Trump’s transition team didn’t return a request for comment.\n",
      "Hannah Perls, a senior staff attorney at Harvard’s Environmental & Energy Law Program, said giving states more control over how they implement and enforce federal laws enables “legal sacrifice zones,” reinforcing or creating disparities based on geography.\n",
      "Federal Rules in Danger\n",
      "\n",
      "One important reform that promises relief for the residents of Laredo is an updated rule adopted by the EPA last spring.\n",
      "Prompted by a lawsuit brought by Cortez’s group, the federal agency’s rule will eventually require facilities nationwide, including those in Texas, to conduct air monitoring for ethylene oxide and add equipment to reduce emissions of the chemical by 90%.\n",
      "Facilities have until 2026 to comply and can ask for extensions beyond that.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But the attorney reportedly nominated to lead the Trump EPA’s air pollution efforts is a friend of the industry that depends on the chemical. Aaron Szabo recently represented the Advanced Medical Technology Association, an industry trade group that includes commercial sterilizers that use ethylene oxide. (His work for the group was first reported by Politico.) Last year, according to his lobbying report, Szabo lobbied the EPA on its “regulations related to the use of ethylene oxide from commercial sterilizer facilities.”\n",
      "Szabo didn’t return a request for comment.\n",
      "Trump and his key picks for important positions in his government have made it clear they intend to roll back environmental protections that burden industry.\n",
      "How far they go will have lasting consequences for residents in the more than 1,000 hot spots ProPublica’s 2021 analysis identified as having elevated and often unacceptable cancer risks from industrial air pollution.\n",
      "Another rule issued by the EPA last year offers a new way to tackle pollution in Calvert City, Kentucky.\n",

      "It was the latest in a series of problems at the factory that state and federal fines had failed to stop. From 2020 to 2023, the EPA had found 46 instances when the facility didn’t correctly operate controls for the chemical. During one inspection, the concentration of dangerous gases coming from a tank was so high that it overwhelmed the EPA’s measuring instrument, according to agency records obtained by ProPublica. Westlake did not respond to requests for comment.\n",
      "The EPA’s updated rule will require more than 100 facilities, including Westlake and the refinery in Pascagoula, to install air monitors along the fence line, or perimeter. The monitors will measure up to six toxic gases, and the data will be posted online.

But ProPublica has documented a long history of state failures to hold polluters accountable — mostly in areas where support for Trump is strong.</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"8.0\">“States generally do not have the resources, experience, equipment, nor the political will to quickly and effectively respond” to serious pollution complaints, Scott Throwe, a former senior enforcement official at the EPA, said in an email.</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"9.0\">In Pascagoula, Mississippi, complaints from <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/they-knew-industrial-pollution-was-ruining-the-neighborhoods-air-if-only-regulators-had-listened\">residents rolled in to the state’s environmental agency for years</a> as a nearby oil refinery, a shipbuilding plant and other facilities regularly released carcinogens like benzene and nickel, according to emissions reports the facilities sent to the EPA.</p>, <p>During Donald Trump’s second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

The instruments were designed to protect industrial workers during eight-hour workdays, not children and medically vulnerable people who need greater protections at home.</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"13.0\">“I don’t live in this house eight hours! I live here 24/7,” said resident Barbara Weckesser, who has complained to the state about the toxic air for more than a decade.</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"15.0\">Jan Schaefer, communications director for the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality, said the agency uses “scientifically sound methods and tools” to address complaints and that looking at just one episode omits “critical context and broader actions taken by the agency to address air quality concerns in Mississippi.”</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"16.0\">Before Trump’s inauguration, the EPA’s regional office said the state agency had applied for a grant to install air monitors, and data collection should begin this spring. The $625,000 long-term air monitoring effort could finally determine the source and scale of the pollution, but the data it produces isn’t “going to trigger something magical to happen,” said Barbara Morin, an air pollution analyst who advises the environmental agencies of eight northeastern states. Either the state or Trump’s EPA will need to analyze the data to see what’s causing the pollution and how to stop it, Morin said.</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"18.0\">Almost immediately after taking office, Trump ordered a freeze on all federal grants, including those at the EPA, sparking a <a href=\"https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2025/02/04/epa-spending-freeze-continues-despite-court-orders-00202253\">legal battle</a>. Nevertheless, Schaefer said the project’s schedule is on track.</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"19.0\">The EPA confirmed that similar activities in the tiny city of Verona, Missouri, where the agency had been cracking down on an industrial plant spewing a dangerous carcinogen, remain ongoing.</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"19.1\">While making an animal feed additive, the plant releases ethylene oxide, a colorless gas linked to leukemia and breast cancer.</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"20.0\">In response to a request from the city’s then-mayor, Joseph Heck, the state conducted a cancer survey of residents in 2022 and determined there wasn’t enough data for detailed analysis. That same year, the plant, operated by <a href=\"https://www.ky3.com/2022/04/19/city-leaders-express-concern-over-recent-spill-verona-mo-plant/\">BCP Ingredients, leaked nearly 1,300 pounds of ethylene oxide</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2022-09/BCP-Ingredients-CAA112r-Inspection-Redacted.pdf\">EPA reported</a>.</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"21.0\">The EPA intervened, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/missouri-epa-air-monitors-louisiana-cancer-alley\">setting up air monitoring</a> in the town, <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-settles-alleged-clean-air-act-violations-bcp-ingredients-inc-verona-missouri\">fining the company $300,000</a> and ordering it to install equipment to remove 99.95% of the ethylene oxide coming out of a particular smokestack. (BCP Ingredients didn’t return a request for comment.) “The EPA has done a lot more than I think the state can ever do,” said Heck, whose partner died of cancer in 2022. Crystal Payne was in complete remission from breast cancer before they moved to Verona, Heck said, but within a year it came back and spread to her brain and her liver.</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"22.0\">A spokesperson with the Missouri Department of Natural Resources said the EPA used its authority under the federal Clean Air Act to compel the company to update its pollution-cutting equipment after the spill. He said the state lacks the power to do that.</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"24.0\">For years, a facility that sterilizes medical equipment in Laredo, Texas, released more ethylene oxide into the air than any other industrial plant in the country, according to emission reports the facility submitted to the EPA.</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"25.0\">Nearly 130,000 nearby residents, including more than 37,000 children, faced an elevated lifetime cancer risk, a ProPublica and Texas Tribune investigation found. The parents of two children diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia, a cancer linked to ethylene oxide exposure, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/a-plant-that-sterilizes-medical-equipment-spews-cancer-causing-pollution-on-tens-of-thousands-of-schoolchildren\">recounted their ordeal</a> and said they had no idea about the risks.</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"26.0\">A statement from Midwest Sterilization Corporation, which operates the Laredo plant, said the company “meets or exceeds all federal and state law requirements” and performs the “important job” of sterilizing medical equipment, which “saves lives.”</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"27.0\">After the EPA released a report in 2016 on the dangers of ethylene oxide, Texas’ environmental agency conducted its own review of the federal study. The state concluded that people could safely inhale the chemical at concentrations thousands of times higher than the EPA’s safe limit.</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"28.0\">The state then passed a rule that meant that polluters didn’t need to lower their emissions.</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"30.0\">Richard Richter, a spokesperson for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, said the agency conducted an in-depth analysis that “led to the conclusion that there was inadequate evidence to support” a link between ethylene oxide and breast cancer.</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"31.0\"><a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/a-plant-that-sterilizes-medical-equipment-spews-cancer-causing-pollution-on-tens-of-thousands-of-schoolchildren\">Scientists told ProPublica</a> that the state agency reached that verdict only after wrongfully excluding studies that linked ethylene oxide to breast cancer and using a flawed analysis of the data EPA relied on.</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"32.0\">The state is the nation’s top ethylene oxide polluter and home to 26 facilities that emit ethylene oxide, according to <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/toxmap/\">ProPublica’s 2021 analysis of EPA data</a> from 2014 through 2018.</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"33.0\">“Texas is extremely industry friendly,” said Tricia Cortez, executive director of the nonprofit Rio Grande International Study Center.</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"34.0\">Cortez said deferring more responsibility to the states “would be disastrous for normal everyday people. … Why should it matter how much you’re protected based on your state’s affiliation? People exposed to something so horrible and cancer-causing should have the same protection everywhere.”</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"35.0\">Representatives for Trump’s transition team didn’t return a request for comment.</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"36.0\">Hannah Perls, a senior staff attorney at Harvard’s Environmental &amp; Energy Law Program, said giving states more control over how they implement and enforce federal laws enables “legal sacrifice zones,” reinforcing or creating disparities based on geography.</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"38.0\">One important reform that promises relief for the residents of Laredo is an <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/epa-rule-ethylene-oxide-sterilization-facilities\">updated rule adopted by the EPA last spring</a>.</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"39.0\">Prompted by a lawsuit brought by Cortez’s group, the federal agency’s rule will eventually require facilities nationwide, including those in Texas, to conduct air monitoring for ethylene oxide and add equipment to reduce emissions of the chemical by 90%.</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"40.0\">Facilities have until 2026 to comply and can ask for extensions beyond that.</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"42.0\">But the attorney reportedly nominated to lead the Trump EPA’s air pollution efforts is a friend of the industry that depends on the chemical. Aaron Szabo recently represented the Advanced Medical Technology Association, an industry trade group that includes commercial sterilizers that use ethylene oxide. (His work for the group was <a href=\"https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2025/01/20/lobbyist-to-lead-epa-air-office-00199410\">first reported by Politico</a>.) Last year, according to his lobbying report, Szabo lobbied the EPA on its <a href=\"https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/e758b4d3-f717-4b3d-a44f-6dba1561b13a/print/\">“regulations related to the use of ethylene oxide</a> from commercial sterilizer facilities.”</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"43.0\">Szabo didn’t return a request for comment.</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"43.1\">Trump and his key picks for important positions in his government have made it clear they intend to roll back environmental protections that burden industry.</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"44.0\">How far they go will have lasting consequences <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/toxmap/\">for residents in the more than 1,000 hot spots ProPublica’s 2021 analysis identified</a> as having elevated and often unacceptable cancer risks from industrial air pollution.</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"45.0\">Another rule issued by the EPA last year offers a new way to tackle pollution in Calvert City, Kentucky.</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"46.0\">Last June, a local chemical plant operated by Westlake Vinyls <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25512937-epa-letter-on-westlake-june-2024-event/\">leaked 153 pounds of ethylene dichloride</a>, a dangerous carcinogen, according to EPA records.</p>, <p class=\"lead-in__title\" id=\"read-more\">Read More</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"48.0\">It was the latest in a series of problems at the factory that <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/calvert-city-kentucky-epa-pollution-westlake-sacrifice-zones\">state and federal fines had failed to stop</a>. From 2020 to 2023, the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25512932-westlake-nopv-december-2024/\">EPA had found 46 instances</a> when the facility didn’t correctly operate controls for the chemical. During one inspection, the concentration of dangerous gases coming from a tank was so high that it overwhelmed the EPA’s measuring instrument, according to agency records obtained by ProPublica. Westlake did not respond to requests for comment.</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"49.0\">The EPA’s <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/epa-finalizes-new-standards-for-cancer-causing-chemicals\">updated rule will require more than 100 facilities, including Westlake</a> and the refinery in Pascagoula, to install air monitors along the fence line, or perimeter. The monitors will measure up to six toxic gases, and the data will be posted online. (It’s unclear exactly which chemicals these two facilities would monitor, though the requirement could cover ethylene dichloride.)  </p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"49.1\">Michael Koerber, a former EPA air quality expert, said the rule could finally give residents some much-needed transparency. Koerber said an earlier EPA rule, which required oil refineries to install fence line monitoring for benzene, led to a significant decrease in benzene from those facilities.</p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"50.0\">But the new rule doesn’t fully take effect until next year. </p>, <p data-pp-blocktype=\"copy\" data-pp-id=\"50.1\">That leaves its enforcement up to the Trump administration.</p>, <p class=\"topics-list__label\"><strong>Filed under —</strong></p>, <p class=\"rich-byline__bio-short\">I report on the EPA and related agencies that oversee the environment, climate change and science.</p>, <p class=\"rich-byline__contact-prompt\">I’m interested in talking to people who work at the EPA, NOAA, USGS and similar agencies.

But with rising temperatures, increasingly frequent wildfires, and extreme weather events, I’ve seen firsthand how climate change is directly and negatively impacting our respiratory health. The effects are particularly severe for vulnerable populations like children, the elderly, and those with preexisting lung conditions, and will only get worse if we don’t proactively respond to our changing environment.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Heat does more than make us uncomfortable; it triggers airway inflammation and worsens conditions like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In certain cases, hospitalization rates were found to increase by 21% to 33% during heatwaves. A European study also found that respiratory mortality increased by a staggering 6.7% for every 1.8°F jump in temperature.\n",
      "Rising temperatures also accelerate the production of ground-level ozone, a harmful gas that irritates airways and can trigger asthma attacks. While stratospheric ozone protects us from UV radiation, ground-level ozone, produced when sunlight reacts with pollutants, poses significant health risks, especially for those with weakened immune systems. Ozone irritates the airways, and even “low-level” ozone exposure has a noticeable effect on children’s ability to breathe and is linked to a rise in child emergency department visits. In patients on whom I’d performed heart or other organ transplants and consequently were on chronic immunosuppressant medicines to prevent organ rejection, I was especially careful to instruct them to avoid high-ozone environments and heed air quality warnings.\n",

      "Particulate matter (PM), particularly PM 2.5 – fine particles 2.5 millimeters or less in diameter – poses another major threat. These tiny particles from vehicle emissions, industrial activity, and wildfires can penetrate deep into our lungs and enter the bloodstream, potentially causing lasting damage to multiple organs via oxidative stress. In Los Angeles today, the burning of buildings and vehicles releases a host of chemicals present in plastics, fuels and metals. Over time, this damage to our organs can lead to conditions like pulmonary fibrosis, a type of scarring of the lung, or lung cancer, even in non-smokers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The impact of wildfires on respiratory health has become increasingly severe. Every county in the contiguous U.S. now experiences at least 16 days of wildfire smoke annually. A study focusing on elderly individuals in the Western United States found that each “smoke day with high wildfire-specific PM 2.5” corresponded with a 7.2% increase in respiratory hospitalizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Children are particularly susceptible to the dangers of wildfire smoke, as their lungs are still developing and because of the high ratio between the amount of air they breathe and their body size. Studies have shown that asthma emergency room visits rise dramatically during wildfires. And long-term exposure to wildfire smoke increases a child’s risk of developing a respiratory disease later in life.\n",
      "Wildfires can even impact the unborn. Children whose mothers were exposed to wildfire smoke during pregnancy are more likely to experience “delay[ed] development” and “suffer from asthma later in life.”The Hurricane Katrina aftermath In New Orleans.

      "\n",
      "The Impact of Extreme Weather Events\n",
      "Floods bring their own set of dangers. After major floods, respiratory illnesses increase due to mold growth and the spread of airborne allergens. Those with existing lung conditions are particularly at risk, as the stress of coping with a natural disaster can weaken the immune system, making them more susceptible to infections and pollutants. Those exposed to flooding in the aftermath of 2017’s Hurricane Harvey, for example, were reported as having a significantly “higher risk of upper respiratory tract symptoms.”\n",
      "Droughts, with the drying up of riverbeds and lakes, lead to dust storms and air pollution. For example, extensive development and water diversions in Utah have led to the accelerated drying up of the Great Salt Lake, resulting in the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases on par with that of 140 commercial planes.CORINNE, UTAH - In an aerial view, an evaporation pond is pinkish-red due to high salinity levels ...

As severe drought continues to take hold in the western United States, water levels at the Great Salt Lake, the largest saltwater lake in the Western Hemisphere, have dropped to the lowest levels ever recorded. Further decline of the lake's water levels could result in an increase in water salinity and could generate dust from the exposed lakebed that could impact air quality in the area.

      "The Rise in Respiratory Conditions\n",
      "Asthma affects approximately 1 in 12 Americans, and the changing climate poses a particular threat to these individuals. Those with asthma have weakened antioxidant defenses, making them especially vulnerable to ozone and particulate matter. Research indicates that children living in areas with high ozone levels are more likely to develop asthma.\n",
      "Even more concerning, lung cancer is increasing despite declining smoking rates. Air pollution is now recognized as the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking, with lung cancer in never-smokers becoming the seventh leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide.17-month old baby using an inhaler. (Photo by: BSIP/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n",
      "What Can You Do? \n",
      "The same pollution that drives climate change also contributes to serious health outcomes. Tackling both air pollution and climate change could significantly reduce the risk of illnesses like lung cancer and childhood asthma in the future.\n",
      "The good news is, there are things we can all do to protect our lungs and reduce the impact of climate change today. These steps include:\n",
      "Individual Actions\n",
      "- Monitor local air quality and avoid outdoor activities on high-pollution days\n",
      "- Wear N95 masks if you must be outdoors during periods of dangerous air quality (like with the LA wildfires)\n",
      "- Consult healthcare providers about specific climate-related health risks\n",
      "- Support local environmental initiatives\n",
      "Community and Policy Solutions\n",
      "While federal change is important, states and regional compacts also make a difference and serve as a testing ground for effective policy. For example, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the northeastern U.S. exemplifies the way in which policy can help decrease the impact of air pollution on respiratory health.\n",
      "In 2005, the governors of seven northeastern states signed an agreement to limit the production of greenhouse gases by power plants. In 2009, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative would go into effect. Four more states would join over the following years. In 2014, it was estimated that the Initiative had “prevented more than 16,000 cases of respiratory illness, 537 cases of asthma, and other illness[es] in children.”\n",
      "Small-scale community action can also positively impact the local environment and, consequently, the health of local populations. In 2017, the Green Heart Louisville Project began planting new greenery in South Louisville, Kentucky; by the end of the project, 8,000 new trees and shrubs were introduced to the area.\n",
      "The result? A quantifiably healthier community. Those living within 4 miles of the new greenery showed 13-20% lower levels of C-reactive protein, which is produced in response to inflammation. Less inflammation means fewer serious respiratory conditions. Also, this specific decrease in C-reactive protein is associated with a 10-15% lower risk of heart attacks, cancer or death as a result of any disease.\n",
      "Private Sector Role \n",
      "Business can also play a role. Last summer, the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) proposed a new rule that would guarantee certain provisions for workers exposed to extreme temperatures. Under specific conditions, workers would be provided with cool water, paid rest breaks if needed, and shade or air-conditioned areas. There is reason to believe that this rule would not only benefit workers but also employers. Similar programs have been implemented elsewhere. For example, a 2017 program meant to protect workers from extreme heat in Nicaragua was found to result in fewer injuries and hospitalizations (decreases of 72% and 94% respectively) as well as a “20% increase in productivity.” Businesses should consider proactively implementing this proposed rule (as Dr. Vanessa Kerry and I outlined here), and considering other ways to protect employees during periods of extreme heat and hazardous air quality.\n",
      "Healthcare Sector Response\n",
      "The National Academy of Medicine's Grand Challenge on Climate Change, Human Health, and Equity, where I serve on the steering committee, is working to address climate change as a public health crisis, focusing on finding ways to creatively engage healthcare systems in the response. U.S. healthcare activities account for an estimated 9% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions, and are responsible for about a quarter of all global healthcare emissions (more than any other nation). Increasingly, there are opportunities for our healthcare systems to play a role in reducing emissions and improving the health of the communities they serve, including through accreditation programs like The Joint Commission’s new sustainable healthcare certification.\n",
      "\n",
      "The science is clear: the changing climate and air pollution threaten our respiratory health. By staying informed, making healthier choices, and advocating for systemic change, we can help protect our health and that of future generations.\n",

There is reason to believe that this rule would not only benefit workers but also employers. Similar programs have been implemented elsewhere.

      "Exposure to higher-than-average levels of outdoor air pollution and extreme temperatures raises the risk of a prolonged pregnancy, new research suggests.An analysis of almost 400,000 live births in Australia has revealed that people who were exposed to very hot or cold temperatures, as well as to elevated levels of fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5), during pregnancy were more likely to give birth after 41 weeks compared with people who were not exposed to those conditions.The average pregnancy normally lasts approximately 40 weeks, while babies who are born after 41 or 42 weeks are referred to as \"late-term\" or \"post-term\" births, respectively. Birth delays can increase the risk of birth complications associated with babies being excessively large — including vaginal bleeding or hemorrhage during delivery — as well as the likelihood of stillbirth or death after birth.The scientists who conducted the new research described their findings in a paper published Jan. 31 in the journal Urban Climate. They claim to be the first to investigate how climate change may affect the risk of prolonged pregnancy.Related: 'Dengue is coming': Climate-fueled rise in cases will affect the US, scientists warn\"We know that being 'born too soon' — preterm birth — has well-documented health risks, but little attention has been given to the risks associated with being 'born too late',\" lead study author Sylvester Dodzi Nyadanu, a research associate in environmental health at Curtin University in Australia, said in a statement.In the new study, the researchers examined how much PM2.5 air pollution 393,384 people were exposed to monthly shortly before and during pregnancy, from three months before conception to when they gave birth, based on where they lived. During the same time period, they also used a metric known as the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) to estimate how much thermal stress their bodies were under because of the weather, factoring in elements such as air temperature and humidity.Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter nowGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Overall, they found that 12% — or 47,380 — of the mothers had a prolonged pregnancy (meaning 41 weeks or more) and that higher levels of exposure to PM2.5 and thermal stress measured by the UTCI increased the odds of this happening. This was after they considered other factors that can influence pregnancy duration, such as smoking, socioeconomic status, race and ethnicity, and maternal age. People giving birth for the first time, people over 35, and people living in urban areas were particularly vulnerable to these effects.Exposure to extreme temperatures and air pollution may prolong pregnancy in numerous ways, the researchers said. For example, both factors may increase the production of unstable molecules called \"reactive oxygen species\" which can disrupt hormonal function.RELATED STORIES—200,000 Americans could die of temperature-related causes each year if global warming hits 3 C—Expect more pandemics to sweep the globe in the coming decades—Humanity faces 'grave and mounting threat' of climate change — unless we act, IPCC report revealsSuch risks may become more apparent as climate change increases the number of extreme weather events and reduces air quality, Nyadanu said in the statement.\"This study highlights the need for targeted policies and preventative measures to reduce climate-related health risks, including better air quality regulations and public health initiatives aimed at protecting expectant mothers and children from extreme climatic conditions,\" he added.DisclaimerThis article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.\n",

      "When President Joe Biden announced his Justice40 Initiative, a week after he took office in January 2021, it had been almost 30 years since a U.S. president had signed an executive order related to environmental justice. He directed the federal government to allocate 40 percent of the benefits of climate, clean energy, and other investments to disadvantaged communities “marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.” \n",
      "Biden’s initiative was a kind of rejoinder to President Bill Clinton’s earlier executive order, which directed federal agencies to identify and address the adverse human health and environmental effects of their actions on minority and low-income areas. While much toxic pollution was curbed in the decades in between, for the parts of the country with the highest concentrations of industrial activity, things hadn’t improved at all. More industrial companies set up shop. Dump sites swelled. Contaminated rivers became more contaminated. Lead accumulated in the soil. Biden’s Justice40 Initiative gave his new Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Michael Regan, the task of not looking away. \n",

      "In November 2021, as if to signal that the EPA had turned a leaf, Regan embarked on a tour of Southern towns and cities where the problem of environmental injustice is most acute: Jackson, Mississippi; Cancer Alley and Mossville in Louisiana; Houston, Texas. Dubbed the “Journey to Justice,” he met with community leaders and residents whose testimonies he promised he’d take into account when he returned to Washington. \n",
      "“[The tour] was really eye-opening,” Regan said in an EPA documentary about the trip. “To see it, to feel it, to have conversations. … I saw on the ground people expressing a desire to be treated like everyone else.”     \n",

      "This fall, I set out to retrace Regan’s tour and look for signs of whether and how much the struggle for environmental justice truly advanced under Biden and Regan. Having reported on the region and the EPA’s operations there for six years, I knew that in its most polluted areas, changing conditions on the ground would take longer than a presidential term; still, I wondered whether the immediate actions that residents say they need — fines for companies violating federal standards, home buyouts with fair prices, permit reform, more government transparency — had been granted.\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew that this iteration of the EPA was a test — of the limits of American bureaucracy, of the strength of industrial and corporate power, of the purpose and efficacy of the EPA itself. \n",

      "No previous administration had dedicated enough resources, funds, or public relations efforts needed to confront industry’s unbridled expansion in the country’s most polluted and vulnerable areas. Cleaning up America’s air and water, a bipartisan mission at the EPA’s founding in 1970, has become highly politicized over the years, with reactionary state governments and industrial companies balking at the agency’s attempts to tighten regulations — all of which makes it difficult to imagine another administration, especially one led by Donald Trump, continuing these efforts. \n",
      "Over 500 miles, through thick swampland and crowded interstate highways, I encountered scenes and people that elucidated the promise of Biden’s environmental justice agenda — and where it fell short. The administrator’s visits raised the profile of these industrial sacrifice zones and spurred EPA efforts to strengthen industrial regulations. But many community leaders remained frustrated at the agency’s hesitation to push for more aggressive, systemic change. Policies like permit reform and deepening community engagement could have helped safeguard the progress of the past four years against the whims of President-elect Donald Trump and his incoming administration, which has promised to clear the path for unchecked oil and gas production. Indeed, over the course of the Biden EPA, the agency’s core function was exposed. So were its limits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regan began his Journey to Justice tour in Jackson, Mississippi, on the same day in November 2021 that Biden signed the first of his two landmark climate bills, the bipartisan infrastructure act, into law. The capital city is at the end of a long period of decline. In most of its neighborhoods, tangles of overgrowth spill onto wide, empty streets bearing cracks and potholes. Torn up segments of asphalt and caution tape are ubiquitous. All across south and east Jackson, abandoned homes appear to be overtaken by the land, the roofs fallen in, the windows all gone, vines threading up the exteriors as if to pull the structures back down into the earth.\n",
      "The city, which is more than 80 percent Black and has a poverty rate more than double the national average, is also in dire need of extensive infrastructure upgrades to its water system — an issue within the remit of the EPA. As Biden and Regan were just taking office, a quick succession of severe winter storms caused systemic failures at one of Jackson’s primary water treatment facilities. About 20,000 customers served by the O.B. Curtis plant — 15 percent of the city’s population — lost access to safe, reliable water.\n",
      "The facility lacked proper weatherization equipment and suffered from a lack of corrosion controls, which allowed bacteria to spread throughout the system. By November, the city’s water distribution network was plagued by persistent leaks and lead contamination, and the whole system was nearing a breaking point. Rolling boil-water notices advised residents of E. coli contamination, which causes stomach pain and can lead to kidney damage. Additionally, two separate lawsuits filed by aggrieved parents blamed the city for their children’s lead poisoning diagnoses. One of Regan’s first stops in Jackson was to tour the Curtis plant with Jackson’s mayor, Chokwe Antar Lumumba, and Charles Williams, the city’s Public Works director. He pledged later that day to ensure the community, and others like it, would get the funds they needed to address infrastructure failures endangering public health. \n",

      "Later in the day, after his visit to Wilkins Elementary School, which was enduring low water pressure, Regan championed Biden’s infrastructure spending as a solution to environmental injustice. “We want those who need these resources the most to receive them first,” he said. “So we’re going to work very diligently with our state partners to ensure that, in months not years, communities like Jackson will be able to receive the funds and move forward with investing the funds.” \n",
      "In January 2022, just a few months after Regan’s visit, the EPA issued a notice of violation to the city for failing to comply with the terms of the Safe Drinking Water Act, requiring local officials to develop a corrective action plan. In August, heavy rainfall caused the pumps at O.B. Curtis to fail again. Water pressure throughout the network plunged, and the entire city was without potable water. Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves declared a state of emergency. Pictures of Jacksonians waiting in long queues for National Guardsmen to load crates of water bottles into their cars flashed across national headlines. \n",
      "Regan visited Jackson twice in quick succession. “It’s hard to explain how and why [the] government has failed the city of Jackson and the people of Jackson,” he said in an October interview. When asked whether he would consider implementing “a state or a federal takeover of the Jackson water system,” Regan replied, “We’re evaluating all options.”\n",
      "By November, the EPA’s complaint against Jackson for violating the Safe Drinking Water Act ended up in federal district court, where Judge Henry Wingate issued an order appointing Ted Henifin, an engineer known for his experience overhauling municipal water infrastructure, to manage the system. Several weeks later, the Biden administration allocated an unprecedented $600 million to fix the city’s beleaguered water infrastructure. Something like a takeover was beginning to take form, and it was a moment of great hope for a city that had suffered decades of white flight and discriminatory neglect. \n",
      "But in the years since, Jackson’s water troubles have become not only a crisis of public health, but also one of public trust. A wide cast of characters continues to vie for control of both the system and the narrative, and ordinary people are left wondering about the true state of affairs. In 2023, Henifin created a private company named JXN Water to carry out the overhaul of the city’s water system, and through which all of the federal money is funneled. It was a move that only worsened the issues of trust. The EPA, for its part, has been sidelined in a process it created. \n",

      "I arrived in Jackson on a rainy night last October, about a week before the presidential election. Momentarily forgetting the purpose of my visit, I opened the kitchen tap at my rental to fill a glass of water and was immediately hit with the stench of rotten eggs. I stood by the sink with the tap running for a moment longer, shocked by how quickly I had encountered the very problem residents had described to me on the phone over the past year. Then I noticed the tall water dispenser in the corner.\n",

      "That, she continued, was what it has felt like to have the federal government swoop in to address the failing water system, only for the problems to persist. \n",
      "We were chatting at Themba’s kitchen table. She has warm eyes and curly snow-white hair, which she’d gathered in a high bun. That day, she and other local advocates were still reeling from a recent hearing in which Judge Wingate accused them of being racist against Henifin, a white man, for challenging his governance of the water system. All they’d been agitating for, Themba said while stirring a pot on the stove, is transparency and community engagement.  She and other activists had initially been excited about the engineer, having heard from environmentalists in St. Louis that he had worked miracles there. But instead of a collaborative process, many Jackson residents and activists were shut out once Henifin established his private company to fix the city’s drinking water problem.\n",

      "“I wish that the EPA’s behavior here in Jackson would reflect the goals and the principles that the Biden administration laid out,” Themba said. “They talk about community involvement and all these things, but that’s not what we’ve experienced.”\n",
      "“I’d say right now we’re in the worst position we’ve possibly been in since the EPA stepped in to help us,” said Tariq Abdul-Tawwab, the director of the Mississippi Rapid Response Coalition’s ground support team, which has been instrumental in mobilizing bottled water, filters, and lead testing kits to Jackson residents. Reflecting on the hearing with Judge Wingate, he continued, “When you’re being told you don’t have the right to ask questions, it’s the beginning of the end.”\n",
      "Outside the realm of advocacy and politics, the water crisis has become a part of daily life. Willie Williams, the owner of the local restaurant Sweet Spot, pays a monthly bill to upkeep a water filtration system he installed, because he can’t serve or cook with the tap water. \n",
      "“It’s more than a crisis. I mean, it’s something that you have to add to your budget when you’re a business owner,” he said. “Water is very important.”\n",
      "Another Jackson resident, Lula Henry, who I’d been connected with by a member of the Mississippi Rapid Response Coalition, had recently come home to find her washroom and carport flooded after a group of city contractors blew open a hydrant while working on her street. When I pulled up to her house, furniture and cooking equipment lay scattered throughout the front yard, drying off in the sun. Like other residents I spoke to, Henry only uses the tap water in her house for cooking and bathing, and relies on bottled water for drinking and brushing her teeth. She called JXN Water to understand what happened. No one came to help.\n",

      "The drive from Jackson to south Louisiana takes about three hours, and shortly past the state line, the strips of pine forest flanking the highway give way to extensive swampland. After crossing the freshwater marsh at Lake Maurepas, I was finally in “Cancer Alley,” a stretch of land on the lower Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New Orleans where over 200 industrial facilities operate in the vicinity of historic Black neighborhoods. Recent studies have confirmed what residents of the region have long said, that people living along the fence lines of these industrial operations suffer from higher-than-average rates of miscarriages, infertility, respiratory ailments, and cancer.\n",
      "Under the system of air pollution regulation in the U.S., fighting the construction of new industrial facilities is difficult. Cleaning up existing ones is even harder. Amendments to the Clean Air Act passed by Congress in 1990 divided the country’s industrial landscape into different categories of facilities and gave the EPA a decade to develop a set of regulations for each. It was a momentous task that required agency staffers to collect emissions data for thousands of plants across the country and determine what technologies industrial companies should install to reduce the pollution. These new rules, while useful for reducing — though not eliminating — emissions from facilities without pollution controls, could only work at the margins of the health crisis taking shape in the country’s most industrial areas. As toxicologists often point out, in the case of potent cancer-causing chemicals like dioxins, no level of exposure is considered safe. \n",
      "“There’s nothing in the Clean Air Act itself that says a community has a right to be healthy and safe,” said Monique Harden, a former director at the Deep South Center for Environmental Law and Policy. “It’s a voluminous and very technical document that puts into law the status quo of industrial operations.” \n",
      "As part of his 2021 tour, EPA administrator Michael Regan speaks to residents of “Cancer Alley,” where over 200 industrial facilities operate in the vicinity of historic Black neighborhoods.  EPA\n",
      "Scott Throwe, who spent 30 years working in the EPA’s enforcement division, remembers the 1990s as a time of great activity and immense pressure. Agency staffers were directed to write rules that wouldn’t generate much public comment controversy or lead to lawsuits from chemical companies. In their rush to finalize all the rules by statutory deadlines, certain community health protections fell through the cracks. \n",
      "“It’s like watching a sausage get made. It’s not pretty, and we made a lot of sacrifices,” he recalled. “We couldn’t get perfect rules out, and sometimes they weren’t even very good. They were just OK.”\n",
      "The amendments to the Clean Air Act also directed the EPA to revisit the slate of rules after eight years to assess the cancer risk that remained in communities. Many of these “risk assessments” were conducted under George W. Bush’s EPA, which adopted a far less protective standard of acceptable risk than prior administrations. Whereas the original text of the Clean Air Act said the EPA should strive to protect the public from pollution exposure with a cancer risk greater than 1 in 1 million, the Bush EPA began using the exponentially less protective standard of 1 in 10,000. \n",
      "While the Bush standard may seem fairly protective on its face, agency assessments only evaluate the cancer risk from a single chemical at a time. In reality, though, multiple plants operate simultaneously and in close proximity, releasing a slew of toxic chemicals on surrounding communities. The true cancer risk is cumulative.\n",
      "The task, then, of enforcing these standards lies with state governments. Regulators in state agencies have wide latitude to permit new industrial facilities, along with construction and operating permits, wherever they see fit, including in areas that are already highly polluted. \n",
      "When Regan came to Cancer Alley in November 2021, he visited Fifth Ward Elementary in St. John the Baptist Parish. The school sits in the shadow of the Japanese chemical company Denka’s synthetic rubber manufacturing plant. Regan told residents that the proximity of the facility’s toxic chloroprene emissions to the school reminded him of his young son, and that the trip compelled him to use his “bully pulpit” to make change. \n",
      "Later, Regan left for a tour of nearby St. James Parish. Among the group of activists, local residents, and reporters there to receive Regan and his staff was Sharon Lavigne, a local organizer. When he emerged from his travel bus, the sight of a sharply dressed Black man around the age of her son shocked Lavigne. \n",
      "“I thought it would have been an all-white man with gray hair,” she said. “He was good-looking!”\n",
      "When Sharon Lavigne met Regan in 2021, the sight of a sharply dressed Black man shocked her. “He was good-looking!” she said. Eric Vance / EPA\n",
      "Regan expressed surprise at how close chemical storage tanks were to people’s homes. The administrator promised to buff up the EPA’s inspections of local facilities and require certain companies to install air monitors around their facilities.  \n",
      "In early 2022, Lavigne’s organization, Rise St. James, and several other local environmental groups filed two separate civil rights complaints with the EPA. One complaint alleged that the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, or LDEQ, had behaved discriminatorily by granting permits to companies to build in the parish’s Black neighborhoods, such as the Taiwanese chemical group Formosa’s proposal for a plastics complex in St. James Parish. The other contested the state’s decision to let Denka continue operating in St. John, despite the EPA’s own data showing that the cancer risk it generated violated federal standards. During previous presidential administrations, the EPA had allowed such complaints to languish unresolved, but under Regan’s leadership, the agency opened a civil rights probe into conditions in Cancer Alley. \n",
      "Lavigne visits the graveyard where many of her friends are buried in St. James Parish. Lylla Younes / Grist\n",
      "Federal and state officials were making significant progress at the negotiating table in the early part of 2023. Louisiana officials agreed to assess pollution levels in communities before greenlighting new industrial development. But then Attorney General Jeff Landry (who’s now governor of the state) sued the EPA and the Department of Justice, arguing that they were overextending their authority. A month later, the EPA closed its investigation.\n",
      "To Lavigne, the EPA’s handling of the civil rights complaints constituted a genuine attempt at improving conditions in Cancer Alley. Others I spoke to weren’t so generous. Lifelong St. James resident Melvin Whittington said the EPA’s actions in the region amounted to little more than “a front to make you think they’re doing something, but they’re not.” \n",
      "With the civil rights probe closed, the EPA has run up against the extent of its power to do anything about the alleged discrimination in Formosa’s permitting. As for Denka, an EPA lawsuit against the company has been slowly making its way through the court system while the facility continues emitting the highly carcinogenic chemical chloroprene. In June, the NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund sued the St. John the Baptist school board for violating its Civil Rights-era desegregation order by exposing the majority-Black student body to Denka’s toxic pollution — a tactic that exposes why the dynamics inherent to the hopeful phrase “environmental justice” are sometimes referred to with the more unforgiving phrase “environmental racism.”  \n",

      "On the morning of Election Day, I headed west toward Lake Charles, Louisiana, passing through sprawling fields of soybean and sugarcane under an overcast sky. The serpentine Calcasieu River forms the city’s northern border, and across it lie the industrial town of Westlake and the community of Mossville. \n",
      "I’d been here before, back in 2021, when I sat on the plush couch of Debra Sullivan Ramirez’s dimly lit living room, just a month before Regan’s tour. Sullivan Ramirez grew up in Mossville and moved to the city of Lake Charles in the late 1980s to get her three children away from the pollution, which she attributed to the lesions that had formed on their skin. As I sat with Sullivan Ramirez and two of her friends, discussing the string of diseases that had stalked her family, she handed me a stack of documents she’d saved over the years — newspaper clippings detailing fires and explosions at local plants, permit files, emissions registers — evidence of a place under siege. \n",
      "Over the past several decades, the greater Lake Charles-Mossville area has transformed into a transnational oil and gas hub, with new pipelines, liquified natural gas terminals, and industrial plants rising up out of the swamp and filling the air with the din of construction and the sweet odor of synthetic chemicals. In 2001, the South African chemical company Sasol, whose plant outside of Johannesburg is the biggest single emitter of carbon dioxide in the world, began building an ethane cracker in Mossville to produce ethylene. Sasol didn’t begin the industrial takeover of the town — that had started as far back as the 1940s — but it exacerbated the problems. \n",
      "After deciding to expand its complex to include an ethylene cracker and a gas-to-liquid plant, Sasol began making offers to buy the properties of Mossville residents, but a study has shown that the company offered significantly less money to Black homeowners, many of whom trace their ancestry back to the founding of Mossville by formerly enslaved people. Some residents decided to take the buyouts anyway, and some decided to stay.\n",
      "There are four things that the people of Mossville still want, Sullivan Ramirez told me: a lifetime of health insurance, free education, enough money to buy a proper home, and a memorial to honor everyone who’d died with cancer and liver failure. \n",
      "Once called “the world’s most important chemical,” ethylene is used to manufacture everything from food packaging and airplane engines to polyester and drainage pipes. Toxic as it may be to create, it is an essential ingredient to modern life. But as Mossville learned, some people have to pay a higher price for it. A 2000 study from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry found that the level of dioxins in Mossville residents’ blood was triple the national average.\n",
      "When Regan’s tour bus pulled into Mossville that November, members of the Concerned Citizens of Mossville, a local advocacy group, showed him around. As they drove, one person asked Regan whether he was wearing a face mask to protect himself from COVID or from the air pollution. “Both, in this case,” he replied.\n",
      "Regan takes a walking tour of Mossville, where the roads leading into town are lined with abandoned homes with faded for-sale signs, in 2021. Eric Vance / EPA\n",
      "“It’s astonishing to see the level — the presence — of industry surrounding this community,” Regan told reporters later that day. \n",
      "When I returned to Sullivan Ramirez’s house this fall, she was dismayed by the EPA’s actions since Regan’s visit. In January 2022, Regan announced funding for increased air and water monitoring in Mossville, but little else. Companies were rarely fined, or paid minimal amounts, for breaching federal emissions standards, and most importantly, people felt as though there was no way out. (Sasol, which earned $275 billion in 2024, reached a $1.4 million settlement with EPA last April for a string of violations, including a chemical fire at the facility). “EPA is just trying to pacify us. They’ve done nothing but ignore the community folk and what they want,” Sullivan Ramirez said. “We want true change.”\n",
      "Today, the roads leading into Mossville are lined with abandoned homes with faded for-sale signs. As I approached, the air became acrid and I felt a familiar pressure in my nose, a sign of my proximity to petrochemical pollution. In the parking lot of the old community rec center, a man on a four-wheeler approached and asked what I was doing there. When I said I was a reporter, he waved me off and began driving away.\n",
      "“Are you from Mossville?” I quickly asked. \n",
      "He said he didn’t want to talk, that people like me came through from time to time and took pictures of the plants looming over people’s homes — and then they left. \n",
      "But, he said, he’d been living there all his life. His mother’s home was down the road. The rec center was still open, he said, and if I stayed long enough I might see some kids playing ball. Sure, many folks had left. But for some, he made clear, Mossville was still home.\n",
      "Mossville seemed to represent more clearly than anywhere I’d visited the terminus of unchecked industrial growth, the final result of a regulatory system administered by industry-friendly state governments and overseen by a federal agency with little power to do anything to upset business as usual. A well meaning EPA, like Biden and Regan’s, could offer an ear to communities in the crossfire or require companies to use better technology and hang up air monitors. But in a place like Mossville, the root of the injustice — a massive chemical complex — is left unchecked.\n",

      "The neighborhood is framed by plants that make concrete along Interstate 45 to the west and metal recyclers dotting Interstate 69 to the east. A cancer cluster, defined as a greater-than-expected number of cancer cases in a particular area, was identified in the community, linked to a toxic plume of creosote in the soil. The site is currently owned by Union Pacific Railroad, which acquired it in a merger with the Southern Pacific Railroad in the 1990s. A 2020 Houston Health Department study of the Fifth Ward found that more than 40 percent of the households surveyed had at least one cancer case. \n",

He sat in the front yard of local activist Sandra Edwards’ home, and listened as she detailed the experience of living on contaminated earth. She wanted more than just a reduction in pollution levels. Like Sullivan Ramirez in Lake Charles, Edwards demanded restitution for the harm already done to residents’ health. \n",

      "Regan promised Fifth Ward residents what he had other communities on the tour — air monitoring, stronger enforcement, and better oversight of the state regulator. \n",
      "“EPA is exploring ways that we can legally read the Clean Air Act in a way that allows us to take into consideration some of these external factors,” he said. “Do we believe that there’s some vulnerabilities there if people want to challenge us in court? Possibly. But the only way to find out is to test it.”\n",

      "At the start of Regan’s term, Air Alliance Houston had really believed that change would come, but, Gutierrez said, “Here we are, four years later, with not much to really speak of.” The industrial facilities surrounding Houston kept up their steady work: In 2023, the city’s smog levels violated health-based standards on 55 days, more than any other year since 2011.\n",
      "“We have access to EPA now,” she continued, “but what has that actually translated to?” \n",
      "One thing that the EPA did do, in November, was to release its Interim Framework for Advancing Consideration of Cumulative Impacts, which the agency opened for community feedback. Once the document is finalized, it will provide guidance for local governments to better understand and mitigate the effects of cumulative pollution. That framework, however, will amount to little more than words of advice to state agencies unless a successive EPA administrator moves it forward.\n",

      "On the last day of my trip, I drove back east to a city that Regan skipped over — Port Arthur, Texas, which is 75 percent non-white and is one of the country’s most important fossil fuel export hubs, where thousands of cubic feet of fracked gas are loaded onto tankers and shipped to Europe each year. \n",
      "I was on my way to meet with John Beard, an environmental advocate and former chemical industry worker who’s now known for giving his own kind of tours. We were joined by a group of European climate activists traveling between hotspots of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. \n",
      "We piled into Beard’s car and drove through the old downtown toward the industrial infrastructure along the coast. Abandoned buildings lined the streets around the city hall. In the surrounding neighborhoods, many homes had boards or plastic sheets instead of windows — damage from past hurricane seasons. Beard began listing facts about the city’s petrochemical history.\n",
      "John Beard, an environmental advocate and former chemical industry worker, is now known for giving what he calls “toxic tours” of Port Arthur, Texas. Lylla Younes / Grist\n",
      "The first refineries in Port Arthur were built in 1903, he said, and the only time they ever stopped operating was during Hurricane Harvey in 2017. The two largest refineries in the country were located there, within 15 miles of each other. Beard worked as an operator at the one owned by Exxon Mobil for 38 years. \n",
      "As we crested a bridge overlooking the patchwork of industrial complexes in western Port Arthur, he rolled down the windows.\n",
      "“You’re smelling wood particles that are laced with formaldehyde,” he informed us, gesturing toward a wood pellet manufacturing facility just out of view.\n",
      "For several hours, we drove between the different industrial operations in town, stopping to photograph hundred-foot flares and smokestacks emitting billowing steam. Across the river from Sempra Energy’s new liquified natural gas terminal, a group of fishermen were reeling in their daily catch while a pelican perched on a railing nearby, eying them cautiously. According to data from the Texas Cancer Registry, cancer rates among Black residents in Jefferson County, which encompasses Port Arthur and the industrial city of Beaumont to the north, are around 15 percent higher than the state average.\n",
      "The cruel irony of all the Gulf Coast’s industrial corridors — that mere miles away from neighborhoods where people are too financially stressed to repair their hurricane-damaged homes, the world’s highest revenue-generating companies operate — seemed particularly pronounced in Port Arthur. Workers come from “lily white” suburbs, Beard explained, while locals struggle to make ends meet. The city’s poverty rate hovers around 30 percent, nearly triple the national average. \n",
      "It’s the same formula I had seen again and again, in the towns Regan visited and in the dozens of others he hadn’t. It’s a problem bigger than the Southern U.S., one that spans Midwestern cities like Gary, Indiana, and southwestern villages like Murray Acres, New Mexico; places where people’s health and futures had been sacrificed for industries that promised to make the country more prosperous and comfortable to all.\n",
      "It’s also a problem bigger than the EPA. With approvals from elected officials, industrial companies will always set up shop where it’s most profitable for them to: alongside deepwater ports, near natural resource deposits, and in areas where infrastructure like pipelines and roads already exist. The EPA’s job, then, is to somehow regulate the ever-expanding anatomy of industrial America. Its mandate does not require it to consider the necessity or risks of an operation before it comes into being; only to ensure that operation remains in compliance with federal standards. Regan’s EPA tightened many of these rules, requiring for the first time, for example, that synthetic chemical manufacturers monitor the air near their plants. But in a place like Port Arthur, where different kinds of pollution sources operate in the same industrial sprawl, clotting the air and coloring the water, no amount of overhauled regulations (which take years to come into effect) can make it safe. Perhaps this is the most we can expect of the EPA, regardless of whom the president is: incremental progress in the form of pollution-source rule updates, too slow to match the churn of economic growth. \n",
      "I reached out to Administrator Regan to get his thoughts on what I’d heard as I retraced the path he took four years prior. I also requested an interview with Earthea Nance, the administrator of EPA Region 6, which includes Texas and Louisiana. Neither would meet with me, their press secretaries informed me. They were busy wrapping up their terms and preparing for the holidays, the national office’s spokesperson said, but I could look out for a documentary about the tour soon to be published on the agency’s website. It would answer most of my questions, he assured me. \n",
      "The video, however, told a familiar story in American politics. Regan decried the environmental pollution he witnessed as “unacceptable anywhere in the United States of America.” And then he championed government funding as the solution. “At EPA, we have designed billions of dollars in grant programs, billions of dollars being invested into our infrastructure to ensure that every single person — no matter the money in your pockets, the color of your skin, or the ZIP code you live in — will have access to clean water, clean air, and safe and healthy lands.” Ultimately, the video betrayed no concern about the threat to such funding under Donald Trump’s next term; nor did Regan himself speak directly to the root of the pollution — industrial activity. “The journey to justice continues,” Regan concluded. \n",
      "Our final stop on Beard’s tour was a refinery owned by Motiva, a U.S. subsidiary of a Saudi company, separated from a single house by a levee, a weak creek, and a road — maybe 100 feet. Beard knew the woman who lived there, and wondered if she was home. All along the levee, signs warned passersby of the highly pressurized natural gas pipeline that ran under their feet. Long white cushions had been laid across the ditch; Beard asked us to guess what they were. Nobody offered any.\n",

Four years later, they’re still waiting.</p>, <p class=\"has-drop-cap has-default-font-family\">When President Joe Biden announced his Justice40 Initiative, a week after he took office in January 2021, it had been almost 30 years since a U.S. president had signed an <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/joe-biden/2021\">executive order related to environmental justice</a>. He directed the federal government to allocate 40 percent of the benefits of climate, clean energy, and other investments to disadvantaged communities “marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.” </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Biden’s initiative was a kind of rejoinder to President Bill Clinton’s earlier executive order, which directed federal agencies to identify and address the adverse human health and environmental effects of their actions on minority and low-income areas. While much toxic pollution was curbed in the decades in between, for the parts of the country with the highest concentrations of industrial activity, things hadn’t improved at all. More industrial companies set up shop. Dump sites swelled. Contaminated rivers became more contaminated. Lead accumulated in the soil. Biden’s Justice40 Initiative gave his new Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Michael Regan, the task of not looking away. </p>, <p class=\"modal-content__message\">To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider <a href=\"https://grist.org/how-to-whitelist-grist\" target=\"_blank\">disabling your ad-blocker</a> to allow ads on Grist. <a class=\"modal-content__link\" href=\"https://grist.org/how-to-whitelist-grist\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"modal-content__link-text\">Here's How</span><span class=\"icon-right-1\"></span></a></p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">In November 2021, as if to signal that the EPA had turned a leaf, Regan embarked on a tour of Southern towns and cities where the problem of environmental injustice is most acute: Jackson, Mississippi; Cancer Alley and Mossville in Louisiana; Houston, Texas. Dubbed the “Journey to Justice,” he met with community leaders and residents whose testimonies he promised he’d take into account when he returned to Washington. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“[The tour] was really eye-opening,” Regan said in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYIK_JgTzBg\">an EPA documentary about the trip</a>. “To see it, to feel it, to have conversations. … I saw on the ground people expressing a desire to be treated like everyone else.”     <div class=\"wp-block-article-donation\" id=\"wp-block-article-donation\">\n",

      "</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">This fall, I set out to retrace Regan’s tour and look for signs of whether and how much the struggle for environmental justice truly advanced under Biden and Regan. Having reported on the region and the EPA’s operations there for six years, I knew that in its most polluted areas, changing conditions on the ground would take longer than a presidential term; still, I wondered whether the immediate actions that residents say they need — fines for companies violating federal standards, home buyouts with fair prices, permit reform, more government transparency — had been granted.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">I knew that this iteration of the EPA was a test — of the limits of American bureaucracy, of the strength of industrial and corporate power, of the purpose and efficacy of the EPA itself. </p>, <p class=\"modal-content__message\">To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider <a href=\"https://grist.org/how-to-whitelist-grist\" target=\"_blank\">disabling your ad-blocker</a> to allow ads on Grist. <a class=\"modal-content__link\" href=\"https://grist.org/how-to-whitelist-grist\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"modal-content__link-text\">Here's How</span><span class=\"icon-right-1\"></span></a></p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">No previous administration had dedicated enough resources, funds, or public relations efforts needed to confront industry’s unbridled expansion in the country’s most polluted and vulnerable areas. Cleaning up America’s air and water, a bipartisan mission at the EPA’s founding in 1970, has become highly politicized over the years, with reactionary state governments and industrial companies balking at the agency’s attempts to tighten regulations — all of which makes it difficult to imagine another administration, especially one led by Donald Trump, continuing these efforts. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Over 500 miles, through thick swampland and crowded interstate highways, I encountered scenes and people that elucidated the promise of Biden’s environmental justice agenda — and where it fell short. The administrator’s visits raised the profile of these industrial sacrifice zones and spurred EPA efforts to strengthen industrial regulations. But many community leaders remained frustrated at the agency’s hesitation to push for more aggressive, systemic change. Policies like permit reform and deepening community engagement could have helped safeguard the progress of the past four years against the whims of <a href=\"https://grist.org/politics/donald-trump-lee-zeldin-epa-environmental-policy/\">President-elect Donald Trump and his incoming administration</a>, which has promised to clear the path for unchecked oil and gas production. Indeed, over the course of the Biden EPA, the agency’s core function was exposed. So were its limits.</p>, <p class=\"has-drop-cap has-default-font-family\">Regan began his Journey to Justice tour in Jackson, Mississippi, on the <a href=\"https://www.wapt.com/article/epa-administrator-to-tour-jackson-water-plant/38252665\">same day in November 2021</a> that Biden signed the first of his two landmark climate bills, the bipartisan infrastructure act, into law. The capital city is at the end of a long period of decline. In most of its neighborhoods, tangles of overgrowth spill onto wide, empty streets bearing cracks and potholes. Torn up segments of asphalt and caution tape are ubiquitous. All across south and east Jackson, abandoned homes appear to be overtaken by the land, the roofs fallen in, the windows all gone, vines threading up the exteriors as if to pull the structures back down into the earth.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">The city, which is more than 80 percent Black and has a poverty rate more than double the national average, is also in dire need of extensive infrastructure upgrades to its water system — an issue within the remit of the EPA. As Biden and Regan were just taking office, a quick succession of severe winter storms <a href=\"https://www.wlbt.com/2021/02/26/wlbt-granted-exclusive-tour-ob-curtis-water-treatment-plant/\">caused systemic failures</a> at one of Jackson’s primary water treatment facilities. About 20,000 customers served by the O.B. Curtis plant — 15 percent of the city’s population — lost access to safe, reliable water.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">The facility lacked proper weatherization equipment and suffered from a lack of corrosion controls, which allowed bacteria to spread throughout the system. By November, the city’s water distribution network was plagued by persistent leaks and lead contamination, and the whole system was nearing a breaking point. Rolling boil-water notices <a href=\"https://msdh.ms.gov/page/23,27207,341.html#:~:text=In%20spite%20of%20the%20allegations,test%20results%20were%20true%20positives.\">advised residents</a> of E. coli contamination, which causes stomach pain and can lead to kidney damage. Additionally, two separate lawsuits filed by aggrieved parents blamed the city for their children’s lead poisoning diagnoses. One of Regan’s first stops in Jackson was to tour the Curtis plant with Jackson’s mayor, Chokwe Antar Lumumba, and Charles Williams, the city’s Public Works director. He pledged later that day to ensure the community, and others like it, would get the funds they needed to address infrastructure failures endangering public health. </p>, <p>A water tower, left, looms over an abandoned soy depot in Jackson, Mississippi. In another part of town, right, vines overtake old buildings. <em><strong>Lylla Younes / Grist</strong></em></p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Later in the day, after his visit to Wilkins Elementary School, which was enduring low water pressure, Regan championed Biden’s infrastructure spending as a solution to environmental injustice. “We want those who need these resources the most to receive them first,” he said. “So we’re going to work very diligently with our state partners to ensure that, in months not years, communities like Jackson will be able to receive the funds and move forward with investing the funds.” </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">In January 2022, just a few months after Regan’s visit, the EPA issued <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2022-11/MS%20Jackson%20City%20of%20Jackson%20PWS%20Electrical%20Panel%20NON.pdf\">a notice of violation</a> to the city for failing to comply with the terms of the Safe Drinking Water Act, requiring local officials to develop a corrective action plan. In August, <a href=\"https://grist.org/accountability/epa-federal-money-jackson-mississippi-water-crisis/\">heavy rainfall caused the pumps at O.B. Curtis</a> to fail again. Water pressure throughout the network plunged, and the entire city was without potable water. Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves declared a state of emergency. Pictures of Jacksonians waiting in long queues for National Guardsmen to load crates of water bottles into their cars flashed across national headlines. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Regan visited Jackson twice in quick succession. “It’s hard to explain how and why [the] government has failed the city of Jackson and the people of Jackson,” he said <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/video/epa-michael-regan-jackson-mississippi-water-system/\">in an October interview</a>. When asked whether he would consider implementing “a state or a federal takeover of the Jackson water system,” Regan replied, “We’re evaluating all options.”</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">By November, the EPA’s complaint against Jackson for violating the Safe Drinking Water Act ended up in federal district court, where Judge Henry Wingate issued an order appointing Ted Henifin, an engineer known for his experience overhauling municipal water infrastructure, to manage the system. Several weeks later, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-mississippi-jackson-naacp-f6161540d6345f215913b2b41562de5a\">the Biden administration allocated an unprecedented $600 million</a> to fix the city’s beleaguered water infrastructure. Something like a takeover was beginning to take form, and it was a moment of great hope for a city that had suffered decades of white flight and discriminatory neglect. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">But in the years since, Jackson’s water troubles have become not only a crisis of public health, but also one of public trust. A wide cast of characters continues to vie for control of both the system and the narrative, and ordinary people are left wondering about the true state of affairs. In 2023, Henifin created a private company named JXN Water to carry out the overhaul of the city’s water system, and through which all of the federal money is funneled. It was a move that only worsened the issues of trust. The EPA, for its part, has been sidelined in a process it created. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">I arrived in Jackson on a rainy night last October, about a week before the presidential election. Momentarily forgetting the purpose of my visit, I opened the kitchen tap at my rental to fill a glass of water and was immediately hit with the stench of rotten eggs. I stood by the sink with the tap running for a moment longer, shocked by how quickly I had encountered the very problem residents had described to me on the phone over the past year. Then I noticed the tall water dispenser in the corner.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“You’re on a war boat declaring the mission’s been accomplished, but bombs are still dropping,” local activist Makani Themba told me the next morning, referring to President George W. Bush’s <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/uncategorized/20-year-retrospective-reflecting-on-the-mission-accomplished-speech-and-its-aftermath/\">infamous speech</a> about the war in Iraq. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">That, she continued, was what it has felt like to have the federal government swoop in to address the failing water system, only for the problems to persist. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">We were chatting at Themba’s kitchen table. She has warm eyes and curly snow-white hair, which she’d gathered in a high bun. That day, she and other local advocates were still reeling from a recent hearing in which Judge Wingate accused them of being racist against Henifin, a white man, for challenging his governance of the water system. All they’d been agitating for, Themba said while stirring a pot on the stove, is transparency and community engagement.  She and other activists had initially been excited about the engineer, having heard from environmentalists in St. Louis that he had worked miracles there. But instead of a collaborative process, many Jackson residents and activists were shut out once Henifin established his private company to fix the city’s drinking water problem.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“I wish that the EPA’s behavior here in Jackson would reflect the goals and the principles that the Biden administration laid out,” Themba said. “They talk about community involvement and all these things, but that’s not what we’ve experienced.”</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“I’d say right now we’re in the worst position we’ve possibly been in since the EPA stepped in to help us,” said Tariq Abdul-Tawwab, the director of the Mississippi Rapid Response Coalition’s ground support team, which has been instrumental in mobilizing bottled water, filters, and lead testing kits to Jackson residents. Reflecting on the hearing with Judge Wingate, he continued, “When you’re being told you don’t have the right to ask questions, it’s the beginning of the end.”</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Outside the realm of advocacy and politics, the water crisis has become a part of daily life. Willie Williams, the owner of the local restaurant Sweet Spot, pays a monthly bill to upkeep a water filtration system he installed, because he can’t serve or cook with the tap water. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“It’s more than a crisis. I mean, it’s something that you have to add to your budget when you’re a business owner,” he said. “Water is very important.”</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Another Jackson resident, Lula Henry, who I’d been connected with by a member of the Mississippi Rapid Response Coalition, had recently come home to find her washroom and carport flooded after a group of city contractors blew open a hydrant while working on her street. When I pulled up to her house, furniture and cooking equipment lay scattered throughout the front yard, drying off in the sun. Like other residents I spoke to, Henry only uses the tap water in her house for cooking and bathing, and relies on bottled water for drinking and brushing her teeth. She called JXN Water to understand what happened. No one came to help.</p>, <p class=\"has-drop-cap has-default-font-family\">The drive from Jackson to south Louisiana takes about three hours, and shortly past the state line, the strips of pine forest flanking the highway give way to extensive swampland. After crossing the freshwater marsh at Lake Maurepas, I was finally in “Cancer Alley,” a stretch of land on the lower Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New Orleans where over 200 industrial facilities operate in the vicinity of historic Black neighborhoods. <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2024/01/25/were-dying-here/fight-life-louisiana-fossil-fuel-sacrifice-zone\">Recent</a> <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac4360\">studies</a> have confirmed what residents of the region have long said, that people living along the fence lines of these industrial operations suffer from higher-than-average rates of miscarriages, infertility, respiratory ailments, and cancer.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Under the system of air pollution regulation in the U.S., fighting the construction of new industrial facilities is difficult. Cleaning up existing ones is even harder. Amendments to the Clean Air Act passed by Congress in 1990 divided the country’s industrial landscape into different categories of facilities and gave the EPA a decade to develop a set of regulations for each. It was a momentous task that required agency staffers to collect emissions data for thousands of plants across the country and determine what technologies industrial companies should install to reduce the pollution. These new rules, while useful for reducing — though not eliminating — emissions from facilities without pollution controls, could only work at the margins of the health crisis taking shape in the country’s most industrial areas. As toxicologists often point out, in the case of potent cancer-causing chemicals like dioxins, <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2898056/\">no level of exposure</a> is considered safe. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“There’s nothing in the Clean Air Act itself that says a community has a right to be healthy and safe,” said Monique Harden, a former director at the Deep South Center for Environmental Law and Policy. “It’s a voluminous and very technical document that puts into law the status quo of industrial operations.” </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Scott Throwe, who spent 30 years working in the EPA’s enforcement division, remembers the 1990s as a time of great activity and immense pressure. Agency staffers were directed to write rules that wouldn’t generate much public comment controversy or lead to lawsuits from chemical companies. In their rush to finalize all the rules by statutory deadlines, certain community health protections fell through the cracks. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“It’s like watching a sausage get made. It’s not pretty, and we made a lot of sacrifices,” he recalled. “We couldn’t get perfect rules out, and sometimes they weren’t even very good. They were just OK.”</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">The amendments to the Clean Air Act also directed the EPA to revisit the slate of rules after eight years to assess the cancer risk that remained in communities. Many of these “risk assessments” were conducted under George W. Bush’s EPA, which adopted a far less protective standard of acceptable risk than prior administrations. Whereas the original text of the Clean Air Act said the EPA should strive to protect the public from pollution exposure with a cancer risk greater than 1 in 1 million, the Bush EPA began using the exponentially less protective standard of 1 in 10,000. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">While the Bush standard may seem fairly protective on its face, agency assessments only evaluate the cancer risk from a single chemical at a time. In reality, though, multiple plants operate simultaneously and in close proximity, releasing a slew of toxic chemicals on surrounding communities. The true cancer risk is cumulative.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">The task, then, of enforcing these standards lies with state governments. Regulators in state agencies have wide latitude to permit new industrial facilities, along with construction and operating permits, wherever they see fit, including in areas that are already highly polluted. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">When Regan came to Cancer Alley in November 2021, he visited Fifth Ward Elementary in St. John the Baptist Parish. The school sits in the shadow of the Japanese chemical company Denka’s synthetic rubber manufacturing plant. Regan told residents that the proximity of the facility’s toxic chloroprene emissions to the school <a href=\"https://www.desmog.com/2024/04/10/epa-chemical-rule-cancer-alley-environmental-justice-michael-regan-louisiana-sharon-lavigne-robert-taylor/\">reminded him</a> of his young son, and that the trip compelled him to use his “bully pulpit” to make change. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Later, Regan left for a tour of nearby St. James Parish. Among the group of activists, local residents, and reporters there to receive Regan and his staff was Sharon Lavigne, a local organizer. When he emerged from his travel bus, the sight of a sharply dressed Black man around the age of her son shocked Lavigne. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“I thought it would have been an all-white man with gray hair,” she said. “He was good-looking!”</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Regan expressed surprise at how close chemical storage tanks were to people’s homes. The administrator <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYOen4Ni7Pg\">promised</a> to buff up the EPA’s inspections of local facilities and require certain companies to install air monitors around their facilities.  </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">In early 2022, Lavigne’s organization, Rise St. James, and several other local environmental groups filed two separate civil rights complaints with the EPA. One complaint alleged that the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, or LDEQ, had behaved discriminatorily by granting permits to companies to build in the parish’s Black neighborhoods, such as the Taiwanese chemical group Formosa’s proposal for a plastics complex in St. James Parish. The other contested the state’s decision to let Denka continue operating in St. John, despite the EPA’s own data showing that the cancer risk it generated violated federal standards. During previous presidential administrations, the EPA had allowed such complaints to languish unresolved, but under Regan’s leadership, the agency opened a civil rights probe into conditions in Cancer Alley. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Federal and state officials <a href=\"https://grist.org/equity/civil-rights-cancer-alley-louisiana-epa/\">were making significant progress at the negotiating table</a> in the early part of 2023. Louisiana officials agreed to assess pollution levels in communities before greenlighting new industrial development. But then Attorney General Jeff Landry (who’s now governor of the state) sued the EPA and the Department of Justice, arguing that they were overextending their authority. A month later, the EPA closed its investigation.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">To Lavigne, the EPA’s handling of the civil rights complaints constituted a genuine attempt at improving conditions in Cancer Alley. Others I spoke to weren’t so generous. Lifelong St. James resident Melvin Whittington said the EPA’s actions in the region amounted to little more than “a front to make you think they’re doing something, but they’re not.” </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">With the civil rights probe closed, the EPA has run up against the extent of its power to do anything about the alleged discrimination in Formosa’s permitting. As for Denka, an EPA lawsuit against the company has been slowly making its way through the court system while the facility continues emitting the highly carcinogenic chemical chloroprene. In June, the NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund sued the St. John the Baptist school board for violating its Civil Rights-era desegregation order by exposing the majority-Black student body to Denka’s toxic pollution — a tactic that exposes why the dynamics inherent to the hopeful phrase “environmental justice” are sometimes referred to with the more unforgiving phrase “environmental racism.”  </p>, <p>Melvin Whittington, left, said the EPA’s actions in Cancer Alley amounted to little more than “a front.” Whittington lives near the Denka synthetic rubber manufacturing plant, right. <em><strong>Lylla Younes / Grist</strong></em></p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Considering these developments, Whittington wondered aloud whether the organizing they’d committed themselves to in Cancer Alley had even been effective. His words seemed to echo the sentiments of residents I’d spoken to in Jackson, who’d said that for all the resources and attention from the EPA, meaningful change was still elusive. “Doesn’t seem like we’re getting nothing done,” he said.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Five days after I left Cancer Alley, the St. John school board <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/denka-elementary-school-5th-ward-cancer-alley-d8c1307c780f7c457b745f16cf042450\">voted to shut down Fifth Ward Elementary</a>. </p>, <p class=\"has-drop-cap has-default-font-family\">On the morning of <a href=\"https://grist.org/politics/a-stormy-election-day-in-southwest-louisiana/\">Election Day</a>, I headed west toward Lake Charles, Louisiana, passing through sprawling fields of soybean and sugarcane under an overcast sky. The serpentine Calcasieu River forms the city’s northern border, and across it lie the industrial town of Westlake and the community of Mossville. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">I’d been here before, back in 2021, when I sat on the plush couch of Debra Sullivan Ramirez’s dimly lit living room, just a month before Regan’s tour. Sullivan Ramirez grew up in Mossville and moved to the city of Lake Charles in the late 1980s to get her three children away from the pollution, which she attributed to the lesions that had formed on their skin. As I sat with Sullivan Ramirez and two of her friends, discussing the string of diseases that had stalked her family, she handed me a stack of documents she’d saved over the years — newspaper clippings detailing fires and explosions at local plants, permit files, emissions registers — evidence of a place under siege. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Over the past several decades, the greater Lake Charles-Mossville area has transformed into a transnational oil and gas hub, with new pipelines, liquified natural gas terminals, and industrial plants rising up out of the swamp and filling the air with the din of construction and the sweet odor of synthetic chemicals. In 2001, the South African chemical company Sasol, whose plant outside of Johannesburg is the biggest single emitter of carbon dioxide in the world, began building an ethane cracker in Mossville to produce ethylene. Sasol didn’t begin the industrial takeover of the town — that had started as far back as the 1940s — but it exacerbated the problems. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">After deciding to expand its complex to include an ethylene cracker and a gas-to-liquid plant, Sasol began making offers to buy the properties of Mossville residents, but <a href=\"https://www.humanrightsnetwork.org/projects/mossville-displacement\">a study has shown</a> that the company offered significantly less money to Black homeowners, many of whom trace their ancestry back to the founding of Mossville by formerly enslaved people. Some residents decided to take the buyouts anyway, and some decided to stay.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">There are four things that the people of Mossville still want, Sullivan Ramirez told me: a lifetime of health insurance, free education, enough money to buy a proper home, and a memorial to honor everyone who’d died with cancer and liver failure. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Once called <a href=\"https://www.afpm.org/newsroom/blog/ethylene-worlds-most-important-chemical\">“the world’s most important chemical,”</a> ethylene is used to manufacture everything from food packaging and airplane engines to polyester and drainage pipes. Toxic as it may be to create, it is an essential ingredient to modern life. But as Mossville learned, some people have to pay a higher price for it. A 2000 study from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/11/04/erasing-mossville-how-pollution-killed-a-louisiana-town/\">found</a> that the level of dioxins in Mossville residents’ blood was triple the national average.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">When Regan’s tour bus pulled into Mossville that November, members of the Concerned Citizens of Mossville, a local advocacy group, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/12/20/touring-louisianas-chemical-ghost-town\">showed him around</a>. As they drove, one person asked Regan whether he was wearing a face mask to protect himself from COVID or from the air pollution. “Both, in this case,” he replied.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“It’s astonishing to see the level — the presence — of industry surrounding this community,” <a href=\"https://www.kplctv.com/video/2021/11/19/us-epa-administrator-michael-regan-visits-mossville-journey-justice-tour/\">Regan told reporters later that day.</a> </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">When I returned to Sullivan Ramirez’s house this fall, she was dismayed by the EPA’s actions since Regan’s visit. In January 2022, Regan <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-administrator-regan-announces-bold-actions-protect-communities-following-journey\">announced funding for increased air and water monitoring</a> in Mossville, but little else. Companies were rarely fined, or paid minimal amounts, for breaching federal emissions standards, and most importantly, people felt as though there was no way out. (Sasol, which earned $275 billion in 2024, reached a $1.4 million settlement with EPA last April for a string of violations, including a chemical fire at the facility). “EPA is just trying to pacify us. They’ve done nothing but ignore the community folk and what they want,” Sullivan Ramirez said. “We want true change.”</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Today, the roads leading into Mossville are lined with abandoned homes with faded for-sale signs. As I approached, the air became acrid and I felt a familiar pressure in my nose, a sign of my proximity to petrochemical pollution. In the parking lot of the old community rec center, a man on a four-wheeler approached and asked what I was doing there. When I said I was a reporter, he waved me off and began driving away.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“Are you from Mossville?” I quickly asked. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">He said he didn’t want to talk, that people like me came through from time to time and took pictures of the plants looming over people’s homes — and then they left. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">But, he said, he’d been living there all his life. His mother’s home was down the road. The rec center was still open, he said, and if I stayed long enough I might see some kids playing ball. Sure, many folks had left. But for some, he made clear, Mossville was still home.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Mossville seemed to represent more clearly than anywhere I’d visited the terminus of unchecked industrial growth, the final result of a regulatory system administered by industry-friendly state governments and overseen by a federal agency with little power to do anything to upset business as usual. A well meaning EPA, like Biden and Regan’s, could offer an ear to communities in the crossfire or require companies to use better technology and hang up air monitors. But in a place like Mossville, the root of the injustice — a massive chemical complex — is left unchecked.</p>, <p>A playground sits in the shadow of a petrochemical facility in Mossville, Louisiana. More clearly than anywhere I’d visited, Mossville seemed to represent the terminus of unchecked industrial growth. <em><strong>Lylla Younes / Grist</strong></em></p>, <p class=\"has-drop-cap has-default-font-family\">Heading west from Mossville, the problem of pollution hotspots remains starkly apparent on the Texas Gulf Coast, where 10-lane highways fill the air with smog and dozens of industrial companies operate close together and share pipelines, storage infrastructure, and export docks. Regan traveled these highways on his way to Houston’s Fifth Ward, the last stop on the Journey to Justice. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">The neighborhood is framed by plants that make concrete along Interstate 45 to the west and metal recyclers dotting Interstate 69 to the east. A cancer cluster, defined as a greater-than-expected number of cancer cases in a particular area, <a href=\"https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/energy-environment/2024/03/29/482063/cancer-causing-chemicals-exceed-normal-levels-near-union-pacific-railyard-epa-says/\">was identified in the community</a>, linked to a toxic plume of creosote in the soil. The site is currently owned by Union Pacific Railroad, which acquired it in a merger with the Southern Pacific Railroad in the 1990s. A <a href=\"https://www.houstonhealth.org/media/3296/download\">2020 Houston Health Department study</a> of the Fifth Ward found that more than 40 percent of the households surveyed had at least one cancer case. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Regan visited two churches and an elementary school in the Fifth Ward. He sat in the front yard of local activist Sandra Edwards’ home, and listened as she detailed the experience of living on contaminated earth. She wanted more than just a reduction in pollution levels. Like Sullivan Ramirez in Lake Charles, Edwards demanded restitution for the harm already done to residents’ health. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“We shouldn’t have to go all the way to the medical center across town,” she told him. “We should bring a facility to this neighborhood for people.”</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Regan promised Fifth Ward residents what he had other communities on the tour — air monitoring, stronger enforcement, and better oversight of the state regulator. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“EPA is exploring ways that we can legally read the Clean Air Act in a way that allows us to take into consideration some of these external factors,” he said. “Do we believe that there’s some vulnerabilities there if people want to challenge us in court? Possibly. But the only way to find out is to test it.”</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Longtime Houston resident Leticia Gutierrez left her corporate job for a position at Air Alliance Houston, an environmental justice advocacy organization, after her son was diagnosed with childhood asthma. Administrator Regan’s visit was meaningful, she said, particularly for the residents he met with, who have long family histories of cancer. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">At the start of Regan’s term, Air Alliance Houston had really believed that change would come, but, Gutierrez said, “Here we are, four years later, with not much to really speak of.” The industrial facilities surrounding Houston kept up their steady work: In 2023, the city’s smog levels violated health-based standards on 55 days, more than any other year since 2011.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“We have access to EPA now,” she continued, “but what has that actually translated to?” </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">One thing that the EPA did do, in November, was to release its <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/cumulative-impacts/interim-framework-advancing-consideration-cumulative-impacts\">Interim Framework for Advancing Consideration of Cumulative Impacts</a>, which the agency opened for community feedback. Once the document is finalized, it will provide guidance for local governments to better understand and mitigate the effects of cumulative pollution. That framework, however, will amount to little more than words of advice to state agencies unless a successive EPA administrator moves it forward.</p>, <p class=\"has-drop-cap has-default-font-family\">On the last day of my trip, I drove back east to a city that Regan skipped over — Port Arthur, Texas, which is 75 percent non-white and is one of the country’s most important fossil fuel export hubs, where thousands of cubic feet of fracked gas are loaded onto tankers and shipped to Europe each year. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">I was on my way to meet with John Beard, an environmental advocate and former chemical industry worker who’s now known for giving his own kind of tours. We were joined by a group of European climate activists traveling between hotspots of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">We piled into Beard’s car and drove through the old downtown toward the industrial infrastructure along the coast. Abandoned buildings lined the streets around the city hall. In the surrounding neighborhoods, many homes had boards or plastic sheets instead of windows — damage from past hurricane seasons. Beard began listing facts about the city’s petrochemical history.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">The first refineries in Port Arthur were built in 1903, he said, and the only time they ever stopped operating was during Hurricane Harvey in 2017. The two largest refineries in the country were located there, within 15 miles of each other. Beard worked as an operator at the one owned by Exxon Mobil for 38 years. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">As we crested a bridge overlooking the patchwork of industrial complexes in western Port Arthur, he rolled down the windows.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“You’re smelling wood particles that are laced with formaldehyde,” he informed us, gesturing toward a wood pellet manufacturing facility just out of view.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">For several hours, we drove between the different industrial operations in town, stopping to photograph hundred-foot flares and smokestacks emitting billowing steam. Across the river from Sempra Energy’s new liquified natural gas terminal, a group of fishermen were reeling in their daily catch while a pelican perched on a railing nearby, eying them cautiously. According to data from the Texas Cancer Registry, cancer rates among Black residents in Jefferson County, which encompasses Port Arthur and the industrial city of Beaumont to the north, are around 15 percent higher than the state average.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">The cruel irony of all the Gulf Coast’s industrial corridors — that mere miles away from neighborhoods where people are too financially stressed to repair their hurricane-damaged homes, the world’s highest revenue-generating companies operate — seemed particularly pronounced in Port Arthur. Workers come from “lily white” suburbs, Beard explained, while locals struggle to make ends meet. The city’s poverty rate hovers around 30 percent, nearly triple the national average. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">It’s the same formula I had seen again and again, in the towns Regan visited and in the dozens of others he hadn’t. It’s a problem bigger than the Southern U.S., one that spans Midwestern cities like Gary, Indiana, and southwestern villages like Murray Acres, New Mexico; places where people’s health and futures had been sacrificed for industries that promised to make the country more prosperous and comfortable to all.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">It’s also a problem bigger than the EPA. With approvals from elected officials, industrial companies will always set up shop where it’s most profitable for them to: alongside deepwater ports, near natural resource deposits, and in areas where infrastructure like pipelines and roads already exist. The EPA’s job, then, is to somehow regulate the ever-expanding anatomy of industrial America. Its mandate does not require it to consider the necessity or risks of an operation before it comes into being; only to ensure that operation remains in compliance with federal standards. Regan’s EPA tightened many of these rules, requiring for the first time, for example, that synthetic chemical manufacturers monitor the air near their plants. But in a place like Port Arthur, where different kinds of pollution sources operate in the same industrial sprawl, clotting the air and coloring the water, no amount of overhauled regulations (which take years to come into effect) can make it safe. Perhaps this is the most we can expect of the EPA, regardless of whom the president is: incremental progress in the form of pollution-source rule updates, too slow to match the churn of economic growth. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">I reached out to Administrator Regan to get his thoughts on what I’d heard as I retraced the path he took four years prior. I also requested an interview with Earthea Nance, the administrator of EPA Region 6, which includes Texas and Louisiana. Neither would meet with me, their press secretaries informed me. They were busy wrapping up their terms and preparing for the holidays, the national office’s spokesperson said, but I could look out for a documentary about the tour soon to be published on the agency’s website. It would answer most of my questions, he assured me. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">The video, however, told a familiar story in American politics. Regan decried the environmental pollution he witnessed as “unacceptable anywhere in the United States of America.” And then he championed government funding as the solution. “At EPA, we have designed billions of dollars in grant programs, billions of dollars being invested into our infrastructure to ensure that every single person — no matter the money in your pockets, the color of your skin, or the ZIP code you live in — will have access to clean water, clean air, and safe and healthy lands.” Ultimately, the video betrayed no concern about the threat to such funding under Donald Trump’s next term; nor did Regan himself speak directly to the root of the pollution — industrial activity. “The journey to justice continues,” Regan concluded. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Our final stop on Beard’s tour was a refinery owned by Motiva, a U.S. subsidiary of a Saudi company, separated from a single house by a levee, a weak creek, and a road — maybe 100 feet. Beard knew the woman who lived there, and wondered if she was home. All along the levee, signs warned passersby of the highly pressurized natural gas pipeline that ran under their feet. Long white cushions had been laid across the ditch; Beard asked us to guess what they were. Nobody offered any.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Oil absorbers, he said finally, laid down to absorb the crude oil that floated into the creek. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“What are we making this sacrifice for?” Beard asked. “It is certainly not doing us any good.”</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\"><em>Correction: An earlier version of this article misidentified the company responsible for soil pollution in Houston’s Fifth Ward neighborhood. It was the Southern Pacific Railroad, which was later acquired by Union Pacific Railroad.</em></p>, <p></p>, <p>A message from   <svg class=\"site-logo__logo\" viewbox=\"0 0 305 103\">\n",

      "When President Joe Biden announced his Justice40 Initiative, a week after he took office in January 2021, it had been almost 30 years since a U.S. president had signed an executive order related to environmental justice. He directed the federal government to allocate 40 percent of the benefits of climate, clean energy, and other investments to disadvantaged communities “marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.” \n",
      "Biden’s initiative was a kind of rejoinder to President Bill Clinton’s earlier executive order, which directed federal agencies to identify and address the adverse human health and environmental effects of their actions on minority and low-income areas. While much toxic pollution was curbed in the decades in between, for the parts of the country with the highest concentrations of industrial activity, things hadn’t improved at all. More industrial companies set up shop. Dump sites swelled. Contaminated rivers became more contaminated. Lead accumulated in the soil. Biden’s Justice40 Initiative gave his new Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Michael Regan, the task of not looking away. \n",

      "In November 2021, as if to signal that the EPA had turned a leaf, Regan embarked on a tour of Southern towns and cities where the problem of environmental injustice is most acute: Jackson, Mississippi; Cancer Alley and Mossville in Louisiana; Houston, Texas. Dubbed the “Journey to Justice,” he met with community leaders and residents whose testimonies he promised he’d take into account when he returned to Washington. \n",

      "This fall, I set out to retrace Regan’s tour and look for signs of whether and how much the struggle for environmental justice truly advanced under Biden and Regan. Having reported on the region and the EPA’s operations there for six years, I knew that in its most polluted areas, changing conditions on the ground would take longer than a presidential term; still, I wondered whether the immediate actions that residents say they need — fines for companies violating federal standards, home buyouts with fair prices, permit reform, more government transparency — had been granted.\n",
      "\n",
      "I knew that this iteration of the EPA was a test — of the limits of American bureaucracy, of the strength of industrial and corporate power, of the purpose and efficacy of the EPA itself. \n",

      "No previous administration had dedicated enough resources, funds, or public relations efforts needed to confront industry’s unbridled expansion in the country’s most polluted and vulnerable areas. Cleaning up America’s air and water, a bipartisan mission at the EPA’s founding in 1970, has become highly politicized over the years, with reactionary state governments and industrial companies balking at the agency’s attempts to tighten regulations — all of which makes it difficult to imagine another administration, especially one led by Donald Trump, continuing these efforts. \n",
      "Over 500 miles, through thick swampland and crowded interstate highways, I encountered scenes and people that elucidated the promise of Biden’s environmental justice agenda — and where it fell short. The administrator’s visits raised the profile of these industrial sacrifice zones and spurred EPA efforts to strengthen industrial regulations. But many community leaders remained frustrated at the agency’s hesitation to push for more aggressive, systemic change. Policies like permit reform and deepening community engagement could have helped safeguard the progress of the past four years against the whims of President-elect Donald Trump and his incoming administration, which has promised to clear the path for unchecked oil and gas production. Indeed, over the course of the Biden EPA, the agency’s core function was exposed. So were its limits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regan began his Journey to Justice tour in Jackson, Mississippi, on the same day in November 2021 that Biden signed the first of his two landmark climate bills, the bipartisan infrastructure act, into law. The capital city is at the end of a long period of decline. In most of its neighborhoods, tangles of overgrowth spill onto wide, empty streets bearing cracks and potholes. Torn up segments of asphalt and caution tape are ubiquitous. All across south and east Jackson, abandoned homes appear to be overtaken by the land, the roofs fallen in, the windows all gone, vines threading up the exteriors as if to pull the structures back down into the earth.\n",
      "The city, which is more than 80 percent Black and has a poverty rate more than double the national average, is also in dire need of extensive infrastructure upgrades to its water system — an issue within the remit of the EPA. As Biden and Regan were just taking office, a quick succession of severe winter storms caused systemic failures at one of Jackson’s primary water treatment facilities. About 20,000 customers served by the O.B. Curtis plant — 15 percent of the city’s population — lost access to safe, reliable water.\n",
      "The facility lacked proper weatherization equipment and suffered from a lack of corrosion controls, which allowed bacteria to spread throughout the system. By November, the city’s water distribution network was plagued by persistent leaks and lead contamination, and the whole system was nearing a breaking point. Rolling boil-water notices advised residents of E. coli contamination, which causes stomach pain and can lead to kidney damage. Additionally, two separate lawsuits filed by aggrieved parents blamed the city for their children’s lead poisoning diagnoses. One of Regan’s first stops in Jackson was to tour the Curtis plant with Jackson’s mayor, Chokwe Antar Lumumba, and Charles Williams, the city’s Public Works director. He pledged later that day to ensure the community, and others like it, would get the funds they needed to address infrastructure failures endangering public health. \n",

      "Later in the day, after his visit to Wilkins Elementary School, which was enduring low water pressure, Regan championed Biden’s infrastructure spending as a solution to environmental injustice. “We want those who need these resources the most to receive them first,” he said. “So we’re going to work very diligently with our state partners to ensure that, in months not years, communities like Jackson will be able to receive the funds and move forward with investing the funds.” \n",
      "In January 2022, just a few months after Regan’s visit, the EPA issued a notice of violation to the city for failing to comply with the terms of the Safe Drinking Water Act, requiring local officials to develop a corrective action plan. In August, heavy rainfall caused the pumps at O.B. Curtis to fail again. Water pressure throughout the network plunged, and the entire city was without potable water. Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves declared a state of emergency. Pictures of Jacksonians waiting in long queues for National Guardsmen to load crates of water bottles into their cars flashed across national headlines. \n",
      "Regan visited Jackson twice in quick succession. “It’s hard to explain how and why [the] government has failed the city of Jackson and the people of Jackson,” he said in an October interview. When asked whether he would consider implementing “a state or a federal takeover of the Jackson water system,” Regan replied, “We’re evaluating all options.”\n",
      "By November, the EPA’s complaint against Jackson for violating the Safe Drinking Water Act ended up in federal district court, where Judge Henry Wingate issued an order appointing Ted Henifin, an engineer known for his experience overhauling municipal water infrastructure, to manage the system. Several weeks later, the Biden administration allocated an unprecedented $600 million to fix the city’s beleaguered water infrastructure. Something like a takeover was beginning to take form, and it was a moment of great hope for a city that had suffered decades of white flight and discriminatory neglect. \n",
      "But in the years since, Jackson’s water troubles have become not only a crisis of public health, but also one of public trust. A wide cast of characters continues to vie for control of both the system and the narrative, and ordinary people are left wondering about the true state of affairs. In 2023, Henifin created a private company named JXN Water to carry out the overhaul of the city’s water system, and through which all of the federal money is funneled. It was a move that only worsened the issues of trust. The EPA, for its part, has been sidelined in a process it created. \n",

      "I arrived in Jackson on a rainy night last October, about a week before the presidential election. Momentarily forgetting the purpose of my visit, I opened the kitchen tap at my rental to fill a glass of water and was immediately hit with the stench of rotten eggs. I stood by the sink with the tap running for a moment longer, shocked by how quickly I had encountered the very problem residents had described to me on the phone over the past year. Then I noticed the tall water dispenser in the corner.\n",
      "“You’re on a war boat declaring the mission’s been accomplished, but bombs are still dropping,” local activist Makani Themba told me the next morning, referring to President George W. Bush’s infamous speech about the war in Iraq. \n",
      "That, she continued, was what it has felt like to have the federal government swoop in to address the failing water system, only for the problems to persist. \n",
      "We were chatting at Themba’s kitchen table. She has warm eyes and curly snow-white hair, which she’d gathered in a high bun. That day, she and other local advocates were still reeling from a recent hearing in which Judge Wingate accused them of being racist against Henifin, a white man, for challenging his governance of the water system. All they’d been agitating for, Themba said while stirring a pot on the stove, is transparency and community engagement.  She and other activists had initially been excited about the engineer, having heard from environmentalists in St. Louis that he had worked miracles there. But instead of a collaborative process, many Jackson residents and activists were shut out once Henifin established his private company to fix the city’s drinking water problem.\n",

      "“I wish that the EPA’s behavior here in Jackson would reflect the goals and the principles that the Biden administration laid out,” Themba said. “They talk about community involvement and all these things, but that’s not what we’ve experienced.”\n",
      "“I’d say right now we’re in the worst position we’ve possibly been in since the EPA stepped in to help us,” said Tariq Abdul-Tawwab, the director of the Mississippi Rapid Response Coalition’s ground support team, which has been instrumental in mobilizing bottled water, filters, and lead testing kits to Jackson residents. Reflecting on the hearing with Judge Wingate, he continued, “When you’re being told you don’t have the right to ask questions, it’s the beginning of the end.”\n",
      "Outside the realm of advocacy and politics, the water crisis has become a part of daily life. Willie Williams, the owner of the local restaurant Sweet Spot, pays a monthly bill to upkeep a water filtration system he installed, because he can’t serve or cook with the tap water. \n",
      "“It’s more than a crisis. I mean, it’s something that you have to add to your budget when you’re a business owner,” he said. “Water is very important.”\n",
      "Another Jackson resident, Lula Henry, who I’d been connected with by a member of the Mississippi Rapid Response Coalition, had recently come home to find her washroom and carport flooded after a group of city contractors blew open a hydrant while working on her street. When I pulled up to her house, furniture and cooking equipment lay scattered throughout the front yard, drying off in the sun. Like other residents I spoke to, Henry only uses the tap water in her house for cooking and bathing, and relies on bottled water for drinking and brushing her teeth. She called JXN Water to understand what happened. No one came to help.\n",
      "\n",
      "The drive from Jackson to south Louisiana takes about three hours, and shortly past the state line, the strips of pine forest flanking the highway give way to extensive swampland. After crossing the freshwater marsh at Lake Maurepas, I was finally in “Cancer Alley,” a stretch of land on the lower Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New Orleans where over 200 industrial facilities operate in the vicinity of historic Black neighborhoods. Recent studies have confirmed what residents of the region have long said, that people living along the fence lines of these industrial operations suffer from higher-than-average rates of miscarriages, infertility, respiratory ailments, and cancer.\n",
      "Under the system of air pollution regulation in the U.S., fighting the construction of new industrial facilities is difficult. Cleaning up existing ones is even harder. Amendments to the Clean Air Act passed by Congress in 1990 divided the country’s industrial landscape into different categories of facilities and gave the EPA a decade to develop a set of regulations for each. It was a momentous task that required agency staffers to collect emissions data for thousands of plants across the country and determine what technologies industrial companies should install to reduce the pollution. These new rules, while useful for reducing — though not eliminating — emissions from facilities without pollution controls, could only work at the margins of the health crisis taking shape in the country’s most industrial areas. As toxicologists often point out, in the case of potent cancer-causing chemicals like dioxins, no level of exposure is considered safe. \n",
      "“There’s nothing in the Clean Air Act itself that says a community has a right to be healthy and safe,” said Monique Harden, a former director at the Deep South Center for Environmental Law and Policy. “It’s a voluminous and very technical document that puts into law the status quo of industrial operations.” \n",
      "As part of his 2021 tour, EPA administrator Michael Regan speaks to residents of “Cancer Alley,” where over 200 industrial facilities operate in the vicinity of historic Black neighborhoods.  EPA\n",
      "Scott Throwe, who spent 30 years working in the EPA’s enforcement division, remembers the 1990s as a time of great activity and immense pressure. Agency staffers were directed to write rules that wouldn’t generate much public comment controversy or lead to lawsuits from chemical companies. In their rush to finalize all the rules by statutory deadlines, certain community health protections fell through the cracks. \n",
      "“It’s like watching a sausage get made. It’s not pretty, and we made a lot of sacrifices,” he recalled. “We couldn’t get perfect rules out, and sometimes they weren’t even very good. They were just OK.”\n",
      "The amendments to the Clean Air Act also directed the EPA to revisit the slate of rules after eight years to assess the cancer risk that remained in communities. Many of these “risk assessments” were conducted under George W. Bush’s EPA, which adopted a far less protective standard of acceptable risk than prior administrations. Whereas the original text of the Clean Air Act said the EPA should strive to protect the public from pollution exposure with a cancer risk greater than 1 in 1 million, the Bush EPA began using the exponentially less protective standard of 1 in 10,000. \n",
      "While the Bush standard may seem fairly protective on its face, agency assessments only evaluate the cancer risk from a single chemical at a time. In reality, though, multiple plants operate simultaneously and in close proximity, releasing a slew of toxic chemicals on surrounding communities. The true cancer risk is cumulative.\n",
      "The task, then, of enforcing these standards lies with state governments. Regulators in state agencies have wide latitude to permit new industrial facilities, along with construction and operating permits, wherever they see fit, including in areas that are already highly polluted. \n",
      "When Regan came to Cancer Alley in November 2021, he visited Fifth Ward Elementary in St. John the Baptist Parish. The school sits in the shadow of the Japanese chemical company Denka’s synthetic rubber manufacturing plant. Regan told residents that the proximity of the facility’s toxic chloroprene emissions to the school reminded him of his young son, and that the trip compelled him to use his “bully pulpit” to make change. \n",
      "Later, Regan left for a tour of nearby St. James Parish. Among the group of activists, local residents, and reporters there to receive Regan and his staff was Sharon Lavigne, a local organizer. When he emerged from his travel bus, the sight of a sharply dressed Black man around the age of her son shocked Lavigne. \n",
      "“I thought it would have been an all-white man with gray hair,” she said. “He was good-looking!”\n",
      "When Sharon Lavigne met Regan in 2021, the sight of a sharply dressed Black man shocked her. “He was good-looking!” she said. Eric Vance / EPA\n",
      "Regan expressed surprise at how close chemical storage tanks were to people’s homes. The administrator promised to buff up the EPA’s inspections of local facilities and require certain companies to install air monitors around their facilities.  \n",
      "In early 2022, Lavigne’s organization, Rise St. James, and several other local environmental groups filed two separate civil rights complaints with the EPA. One complaint alleged that the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, or LDEQ, had behaved discriminatorily by granting permits to companies to build in the parish’s Black neighborhoods, such as the Taiwanese chemical group Formosa’s proposal for a plastics complex in St. James Parish. The other contested the state’s decision to let Denka continue operating in St. John, despite the EPA’s own data showing that the cancer risk it generated violated federal standards. During previous presidential administrations, the EPA had allowed such complaints to languish unresolved, but under Regan’s leadership, the agency opened a civil rights probe into conditions in Cancer Alley. \n",
      "Lavigne visits the graveyard where many of her friends are buried in St. James Parish. Lylla Younes / Grist\n",
      "Federal and state officials were making significant progress at the negotiating table in the early part of 2023. Louisiana officials agreed to assess pollution levels in communities before greenlighting new industrial development. But then Attorney General Jeff Landry (who’s now governor of the state) sued the EPA and the Department of Justice, arguing that they were overextending their authority. A month later, the EPA closed its investigation.\n",
      "To Lavigne, the EPA’s handling of the civil rights complaints constituted a genuine attempt at improving conditions in Cancer Alley. Others I spoke to weren’t so generous. Lifelong St. James resident Melvin Whittington said the EPA’s actions in the region amounted to little more than “a front to make you think they’re doing something, but they’re not.” \n",
      "With the civil rights probe closed, the EPA has run up against the extent of its power to do anything about the alleged discrimination in Formosa’s permitting. As for Denka, an EPA lawsuit against the company has been slowly making its way through the court system while the facility continues emitting the highly carcinogenic chemical chloroprene. In June, the NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund sued the St. John the Baptist school board for violating its Civil Rights-era desegregation order by exposing the majority-Black student body to Denka’s toxic pollution — a tactic that exposes why the dynamics inherent to the hopeful phrase “environmental justice” are sometimes referred to with the more unforgiving phrase “environmental racism.”  \n",

      "On the morning of Election Day, I headed west toward Lake Charles, Louisiana, passing through sprawling fields of soybean and sugarcane under an overcast sky. The serpentine Calcasieu River forms the city’s northern border, and across it lie the industrial town of Westlake and the community of Mossville. \n",
      "I’d been here before, back in 2021, when I sat on the plush couch of Debra Sullivan Ramirez’s dimly lit living room, just a month before Regan’s tour. Sullivan Ramirez grew up in Mossville and moved to the city of Lake Charles in the late 1980s to get her three children away from the pollution, which she attributed to the lesions that had formed on their skin. As I sat with Sullivan Ramirez and two of her friends, discussing the string of diseases that had stalked her family, she handed me a stack of documents she’d saved over the years — newspaper clippings detailing fires and explosions at local plants, permit files, emissions registers — evidence of a place under siege. \n",
      "Over the past several decades, the greater Lake Charles-Mossville area has transformed into a transnational oil and gas hub, with new pipelines, liquified natural gas terminals, and industrial plants rising up out of the swamp and filling the air with the din of construction and the sweet odor of synthetic chemicals. In 2001, the South African chemical company Sasol, whose plant outside of Johannesburg is the biggest single emitter of carbon dioxide in the world, began building an ethane cracker in Mossville to produce ethylene. Sasol didn’t begin the industrial takeover of the town — that had started as far back as the 1940s — but it exacerbated the problems. \n",
      "After deciding to expand its complex to include an ethylene cracker and a gas-to-liquid plant, Sasol began making offers to buy the properties of Mossville residents, but a study has shown that the company offered significantly less money to Black homeowners, many of whom trace their ancestry back to the founding of Mossville by formerly enslaved people. Some residents decided to take the buyouts anyway, and some decided to stay.\n",
      "There are four things that the people of Mossville still want, Sullivan Ramirez told me: a lifetime of health insurance, free education, enough money to buy a proper home, and a memorial to honor everyone who’d died with cancer and liver failure. \n",
      "Once called “the world’s most important chemical,” ethylene is used to manufacture everything from food packaging and airplane engines to polyester and drainage pipes. Toxic as it may be to create, it is an essential ingredient to modern life. But as Mossville learned, some people have to pay a higher price for it. A 2000 study from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry found that the level of dioxins in Mossville residents’ blood was triple the national average.\n",
      "When Regan’s tour bus pulled into Mossville that November, members of the Concerned Citizens of Mossville, a local advocacy group, showed him around. As they drove, one person asked Regan whether he was wearing a face mask to protect himself from COVID or from the air pollution. “Both, in this case,” he replied.\n",
      "Regan takes a walking tour of Mossville, where the roads leading into town are lined with abandoned homes with faded for-sale signs, in 2021. Eric Vance / EPA\n",
      "“It’s astonishing to see the level — the presence — of industry surrounding this community,” Regan told reporters later that day. \n",
      "When I returned to Sullivan Ramirez’s house this fall, she was dismayed by the EPA’s actions since Regan’s visit. In January 2022, Regan announced funding for increased air and water monitoring in Mossville, but little else. Companies were rarely fined, or paid minimal amounts, for breaching federal emissions standards, and most importantly, people felt as though there was no way out. (Sasol, which earned $275 billion in 2024, reached a $1.4 million settlement with EPA last April for a string of violations, including a chemical fire at the facility). “EPA is just trying to pacify us. They’ve done nothing but ignore the community folk and what they want,” Sullivan Ramirez said. “We want true change.”\n",
      "Today, the roads leading into Mossville are lined with abandoned homes with faded for-sale signs. As I approached, the air became acrid and I felt a familiar pressure in my nose, a sign of my proximity to petrochemical pollution. In the parking lot of the old community rec center, a man on a four-wheeler approached and asked what I was doing there. When I said I was a reporter, he waved me off and began driving away.\n",
      "“Are you from Mossville?” I quickly asked. \n",
      "He said he didn’t want to talk, that people like me came through from time to time and took pictures of the plants looming over people’s homes — and then they left. \n",
      "But, he said, he’d been living there all his life. His mother’s home was down the road. The rec center was still open, he said, and if I stayed long enough I might see some kids playing ball. Sure, many folks had left. But for some, he made clear, Mossville was still home.\n",
      "Mossville seemed to represent more clearly than anywhere I’d visited the terminus of unchecked industrial growth, the final result of a regulatory system administered by industry-friendly state governments and overseen by a federal agency with little power to do anything to upset business as usual. A well meaning EPA, like Biden and Regan’s, could offer an ear to communities in the crossfire or require companies to use better technology and hang up air monitors. But in a place like Mossville, the root of the injustice — a massive chemical complex — is left unchecked.\n",

      "Heading west from Mossville, the problem of pollution hotspots remains starkly apparent on the Texas Gulf Coast, where 10-lane highways fill the air with smog and dozens of industrial companies operate close together and share pipelines, storage infrastructure, and export docks. Regan traveled these highways on his way to Houston’s Fifth Ward, the last stop on the Journey to Justice. \n",
      "The neighborhood is framed by plants that make concrete along Interstate 45 to the west and metal recyclers dotting Interstate 69 to the east. A cancer cluster, defined as a greater-than-expected number of cancer cases in a particular area, was identified in the community, linked to a toxic plume of creosote in the soil. The site is currently owned by Union Pacific Railroad, which acquired it in a merger with the Southern Pacific Railroad in the 1990s. A 2020 Houston Health Department study of the Fifth Ward found that more than 40 percent of the households surveyed had at least one cancer case. \n",
      "Regan visited two churches and an elementary school in the Fifth Ward. He sat in the front yard of local activist Sandra Edwards’ home, and listened as she detailed the experience of living on contaminated earth. She wanted more than just a reduction in pollution levels. Like Sullivan Ramirez in Lake Charles, Edwards demanded restitution for the harm already done to residents’ health. \n",

      "Regan promised Fifth Ward residents what he had other communities on the tour — air monitoring, stronger enforcement, and better oversight of the state regulator. \n",
      "“EPA is exploring ways that we can legally read the Clean Air Act in a way that allows us to take into consideration some of these external factors,” he said. “Do we believe that there’s some vulnerabilities there if people want to challenge us in court? Possibly. But the only way to find out is to test it.”\n",
      "Longtime Houston resident Leticia Gutierrez left her corporate job for a position at Air Alliance Houston, an environmental justice advocacy organization, after her son was diagnosed with childhood asthma. Administrator Regan’s visit was meaningful, she said, particularly for the residents he met with, who have long family histories of cancer. \n",
      "At the start of Regan’s term, Air Alliance Houston had really believed that change would come, but, Gutierrez said, “Here we are, four years later, with not much to really speak of.” The industrial facilities surrounding Houston kept up their steady work: In 2023, the city’s smog levels violated health-based standards on 55 days, more than any other year since 2011.\n",
      "“We have access to EPA now,” she continued, “but what has that actually translated to?” \n",
      "One thing that the EPA did do, in November, was to release its Interim Framework for Advancing Consideration of Cumulative Impacts, which the agency opened for community feedback. Once the document is finalized, it will provide guidance for local governments to better understand and mitigate the effects of cumulative pollution. That framework, however, will amount to little more than words of advice to state agencies unless a successive EPA administrator moves it forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the last day of my trip, I drove back east to a city that Regan skipped over — Port Arthur, Texas, which is 75 percent non-white and is one of the country’s most important fossil fuel export hubs, where thousands of cubic feet of fracked gas are loaded onto tankers and shipped to Europe each year. \n",
      "I was on my way to meet with John Beard, an environmental advocate and former chemical industry worker who’s now known for giving his own kind of tours. We were joined by a group of European climate activists traveling between hotspots of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. \n",
      "We piled into Beard’s car and drove through the old downtown toward the industrial infrastructure along the coast. Abandoned buildings lined the streets around the city hall. In the surrounding neighborhoods, many homes had boards or plastic sheets instead of windows — damage from past hurricane seasons. Beard began listing facts about the city’s petrochemical history.\n",
      "John Beard, an environmental advocate and former chemical industry worker, is now known for giving what he calls “toxic tours” of Port Arthur, Texas. Lylla Younes / Grist\n",
      "The first refineries in Port Arthur were built in 1903, he said, and the only time they ever stopped operating was during Hurricane Harvey in 2017. The two largest refineries in the country were located there, within 15 miles of each other. Beard worked as an operator at the one owned by Exxon Mobil for 38 years. \n",
      "As we crested a bridge overlooking the patchwork of industrial complexes in western Port Arthur, he rolled down the windows.\n",
      "“You’re smelling wood particles that are laced with formaldehyde,” he informed us, gesturing toward a wood pellet manufacturing facility just out of view.\n",
      "For several hours, we drove between the different industrial operations in town, stopping to photograph hundred-foot flares and smokestacks emitting billowing steam. Across the river from Sempra Energy’s new liquified natural gas terminal, a group of fishermen were reeling in their daily catch while a pelican perched on a railing nearby, eying them cautiously. According to data from the Texas Cancer Registry, cancer rates among Black residents in Jefferson County, which encompasses Port Arthur and the industrial city of Beaumont to the north, are around 15 percent higher than the state average.\n",
      "The cruel irony of all the Gulf Coast’s industrial corridors — that mere miles away from neighborhoods where people are too financially stressed to repair their hurricane-damaged homes, the world’s highest revenue-generating companies operate — seemed particularly pronounced in Port Arthur. Workers come from “lily white” suburbs, Beard explained, while locals struggle to make ends meet. The city’s poverty rate hovers around 30 percent, nearly triple the national average. \n",
      "It’s the same formula I had seen again and again, in the towns Regan visited and in the dozens of others he hadn’t. It’s a problem bigger than the Southern U.S., one that spans Midwestern cities like Gary, Indiana, and southwestern villages like Murray Acres, New Mexico; places where people’s health and futures had been sacrificed for industries that promised to make the country more prosperous and comfortable to all.\n",
      "It’s also a problem bigger than the EPA. With approvals from elected officials, industrial companies will always set up shop where it’s most profitable for them to: alongside deepwater ports, near natural resource deposits, and in areas where infrastructure like pipelines and roads already exist. The EPA’s job, then, is to somehow regulate the ever-expanding anatomy of industrial America. Its mandate does not require it to consider the necessity or risks of an operation before it comes into being; only to ensure that operation remains in compliance with federal standards. Regan’s EPA tightened many of these rules, requiring for the first time, for example, that synthetic chemical manufacturers monitor the air near their plants. But in a place like Port Arthur, where different kinds of pollution sources operate in the same industrial sprawl, clotting the air and coloring the water, no amount of overhauled regulations (which take years to come into effect) can make it safe. Perhaps this is the most we can expect of the EPA, regardless of whom the president is: incremental progress in the form of pollution-source rule updates, too slow to match the churn of economic growth. \n",
      "I reached out to Administrator Regan to get his thoughts on what I’d heard as I retraced the path he took four years prior. I also requested an interview with Earthea Nance, the administrator of EPA Region 6, which includes Texas and Louisiana. Neither would meet with me, their press secretaries informed me. They were busy wrapping up their terms and preparing for the holidays, the national office’s spokesperson said, but I could look out for a documentary about the tour soon to be published on the agency’s website. It would answer most of my questions, he assured me. \n",
      "The video, however, told a familiar story in American politics. Regan decried the environmental pollution he witnessed as “unacceptable anywhere in the United States of America.” And then he championed government funding as the solution. “At EPA, we have designed billions of dollars in grant programs, billions of dollars being invested into our infrastructure to ensure that every single person — no matter the money in your pockets, the color of your skin, or the ZIP code you live in — will have access to clean water, clean air, and safe and healthy lands.” Ultimately, the video betrayed no concern about the threat to such funding under Donald Trump’s next term; nor did Regan himself speak directly to the root of the pollution — industrial activity. “The journey to justice continues,” Regan concluded. \n",
      "Our final stop on Beard’s tour was a refinery owned by Motiva, a U.S. subsidiary of a Saudi company, separated from a single house by a levee, a weak creek, and a road — maybe 100 feet. Beard knew the woman who lived there, and wondered if she was home. All along the levee, signs warned passersby of the highly pressurized natural gas pipeline that ran under their feet. Long white cushions had been laid across the ditch; Beard asked us to guess what they were. Nobody offered any.\n",
      "Oil absorbers, he said finally, laid down to absorb the crude oil that floated into the creek. \n",
      "“What are we making this sacrifice for?” Beard asked. “It is certainly not doing us any good.”\n",
      "Correction: An earlier version of this article misidentified the company responsible for soil pollution in Houston’s Fifth Ward neighborhood. It was the Southern Pacific Railroad, which was later acquired by Union Pacific Railroad.\n",

Four years later, they’re still waiting.</p>, <p class=\"has-drop-cap has-default-font-family\">When President Joe Biden announced his Justice40 Initiative, a week after he took office in January 2021, it had been almost 30 years since a U.S. president had signed an <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/joe-biden/2021\">executive order related to environmental justice</a>. He directed the federal government to allocate 40 percent of the benefits of climate, clean energy, and other investments to disadvantaged communities “marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.” </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Biden’s initiative was a kind of rejoinder to President Bill Clinton’s earlier executive order, which directed federal agencies to identify and address the adverse human health and environmental effects of their actions on minority and low-income areas. While much toxic pollution was curbed in the decades in between, for the parts of the country with the highest concentrations of industrial activity, things hadn’t improved at all. More industrial companies set up shop. Dump sites swelled. Contaminated rivers became more contaminated. Lead accumulated in the soil. Biden’s Justice40 Initiative gave his new Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Michael Regan, the task of not looking away. </p>, <p class=\"modal-content__message\">To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider <a href=\"https://grist.org/how-to-whitelist-grist\" target=\"_blank\">disabling your ad-blocker</a> to allow ads on Grist. <a class=\"modal-content__link\" href=\"https://grist.org/how-to-whitelist-grist\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"modal-content__link-text\">Here's How</span><span class=\"icon-right-1\"></span></a></p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">In November 2021, as if to signal that the EPA had turned a leaf, Regan embarked on a tour of Southern towns and cities where the problem of environmental injustice is most acute: Jackson, Mississippi; Cancer Alley and Mossville in Louisiana; Houston, Texas. Dubbed the “Journey to Justice,” he met with community leaders and residents whose testimonies he promised he’d take into account when he returned to Washington. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“[The tour] was really eye-opening,” Regan said in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYIK_JgTzBg\">an EPA documentary about the trip</a>. “To see it, to feel it, to have conversations. … I saw on the ground people expressing a desire to be treated like everyone else.”     <div class=\"wp-block-article-donation\" id=\"wp-block-article-donation\">\n",

      "</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">This fall, I set out to retrace Regan’s tour and look for signs of whether and how much the struggle for environmental justice truly advanced under Biden and Regan. Having reported on the region and the EPA’s operations there for six years, I knew that in its most polluted areas, changing conditions on the ground would take longer than a presidential term; still, I wondered whether the immediate actions that residents say they need — fines for companies violating federal standards, home buyouts with fair prices, permit reform, more government transparency — had been granted.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">I knew that this iteration of the EPA was a test — of the limits of American bureaucracy, of the strength of industrial and corporate power, of the purpose and efficacy of the EPA itself. </p>, <p class=\"modal-content__message\">To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider <a href=\"https://grist.org/how-to-whitelist-grist\" target=\"_blank\">disabling your ad-blocker</a> to allow ads on Grist. <a class=\"modal-content__link\" href=\"https://grist.org/how-to-whitelist-grist\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"modal-content__link-text\">Here's How</span><span class=\"icon-right-1\"></span></a></p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">No previous administration had dedicated enough resources, funds, or public relations efforts needed to confront industry’s unbridled expansion in the country’s most polluted and vulnerable areas. Cleaning up America’s air and water, a bipartisan mission at the EPA’s founding in 1970, has become highly politicized over the years, with reactionary state governments and industrial companies balking at the agency’s attempts to tighten regulations — all of which makes it difficult to imagine another administration, especially one led by Donald Trump, continuing these efforts. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Over 500 miles, through thick swampland and crowded interstate highways, I encountered scenes and people that elucidated the promise of Biden’s environmental justice agenda — and where it fell short. The administrator’s visits raised the profile of these industrial sacrifice zones and spurred EPA efforts to strengthen industrial regulations. But many community leaders remained frustrated at the agency’s hesitation to push for more aggressive, systemic change. Policies like permit reform and deepening community engagement could have helped safeguard the progress of the past four years against the whims of <a href=\"https://grist.org/politics/donald-trump-lee-zeldin-epa-environmental-policy/\">President-elect Donald Trump and his incoming administration</a>, which has promised to clear the path for unchecked oil and gas production. Indeed, over the course of the Biden EPA, the agency’s core function was exposed. So were its limits.</p>, <p class=\"has-drop-cap has-default-font-family\">Regan began his Journey to Justice tour in Jackson, Mississippi, on the <a href=\"https://www.wapt.com/article/epa-administrator-to-tour-jackson-water-plant/38252665\">same day in November 2021</a> that Biden signed the first of his two landmark climate bills, the bipartisan infrastructure act, into law. The capital city is at the end of a long period of decline. In most of its neighborhoods, tangles of overgrowth spill onto wide, empty streets bearing cracks and potholes. Torn up segments of asphalt and caution tape are ubiquitous. All across south and east Jackson, abandoned homes appear to be overtaken by the land, the roofs fallen in, the windows all gone, vines threading up the exteriors as if to pull the structures back down into the earth.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">The city, which is more than 80 percent Black and has a poverty rate more than double the national average, is also in dire need of extensive infrastructure upgrades to its water system — an issue within the remit of the EPA. As Biden and Regan were just taking office, a quick succession of severe winter storms <a href=\"https://www.wlbt.com/2021/02/26/wlbt-granted-exclusive-tour-ob-curtis-water-treatment-plant/\">caused systemic failures</a> at one of Jackson’s primary water treatment facilities. About 20,000 customers served by the O.B. Curtis plant — 15 percent of the city’s population — lost access to safe, reliable water.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">The facility lacked proper weatherization equipment and suffered from a lack of corrosion controls, which allowed bacteria to spread throughout the system. By November, the city’s water distribution network was plagued by persistent leaks and lead contamination, and the whole system was nearing a breaking point. Rolling boil-water notices <a href=\"https://msdh.ms.gov/page/23,27207,341.html#:~:text=In%20spite%20of%20the%20allegations,test%20results%20were%20true%20positives.\">advised residents</a> of E. coli contamination, which causes stomach pain and can lead to kidney damage. Additionally, two separate lawsuits filed by aggrieved parents blamed the city for their children’s lead poisoning diagnoses. One of Regan’s first stops in Jackson was to tour the Curtis plant with Jackson’s mayor, Chokwe Antar Lumumba, and Charles Williams, the city’s Public Works director. He pledged later that day to ensure the community, and others like it, would get the funds they needed to address infrastructure failures endangering public health. </p>, <p>A water tower, left, looms over an abandoned soy depot in Jackson, Mississippi. In another part of town, right, vines overtake old buildings. <em><strong>Lylla Younes / Grist</strong></em></p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Later in the day, after his visit to Wilkins Elementary School, which was enduring low water pressure, Regan championed Biden’s infrastructure spending as a solution to environmental injustice. “We want those who need these resources the most to receive them first,” he said. “So we’re going to work very diligently with our state partners to ensure that, in months not years, communities like Jackson will be able to receive the funds and move forward with investing the funds.” </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">In January 2022, just a few months after Regan’s visit, the EPA issued <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2022-11/MS%20Jackson%20City%20of%20Jackson%20PWS%20Electrical%20Panel%20NON.pdf\">a notice of violation</a> to the city for failing to comply with the terms of the Safe Drinking Water Act, requiring local officials to develop a corrective action plan. In August, <a href=\"https://grist.org/accountability/epa-federal-money-jackson-mississippi-water-crisis/\">heavy rainfall caused the pumps at O.B. Curtis</a> to fail again. Water pressure throughout the network plunged, and the entire city was without potable water. Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves declared a state of emergency. Pictures of Jacksonians waiting in long queues for National Guardsmen to load crates of water bottles into their cars flashed across national headlines. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Regan visited Jackson twice in quick succession. “It’s hard to explain how and why [the] government has failed the city of Jackson and the people of Jackson,” he said <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/video/epa-michael-regan-jackson-mississippi-water-system/\">in an October interview</a>. When asked whether he would consider implementing “a state or a federal takeover of the Jackson water system,” Regan replied, “We’re evaluating all options.”</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">By November, the EPA’s complaint against Jackson for violating the Safe Drinking Water Act ended up in federal district court, where Judge Henry Wingate issued an order appointing Ted Henifin, an engineer known for his experience overhauling municipal water infrastructure, to manage the system. Several weeks later, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-mississippi-jackson-naacp-f6161540d6345f215913b2b41562de5a\">the Biden administration allocated an unprecedented $600 million</a> to fix the city’s beleaguered water infrastructure. Something like a takeover was beginning to take form, and it was a moment of great hope for a city that had suffered decades of white flight and discriminatory neglect. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">But in the years since, Jackson’s water troubles have become not only a crisis of public health, but also one of public trust. A wide cast of characters continues to vie for control of both the system and the narrative, and ordinary people are left wondering about the true state of affairs. In 2023, Henifin created a private company named JXN Water to carry out the overhaul of the city’s water system, and through which all of the federal money is funneled. It was a move that only worsened the issues of trust. The EPA, for its part, has been sidelined in a process it created. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">I arrived in Jackson on a rainy night last October, about a week before the presidential election. Momentarily forgetting the purpose of my visit, I opened the kitchen tap at my rental to fill a glass of water and was immediately hit with the stench of rotten eggs. I stood by the sink with the tap running for a moment longer, shocked by how quickly I had encountered the very problem residents had described to me on the phone over the past year. Then I noticed the tall water dispenser in the corner.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“You’re on a war boat declaring the mission’s been accomplished, but bombs are still dropping,” local activist Makani Themba told me the next morning, referring to President George W. Bush’s <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/uncategorized/20-year-retrospective-reflecting-on-the-mission-accomplished-speech-and-its-aftermath/\">infamous speech</a> about the war in Iraq. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">That, she continued, was what it has felt like to have the federal government swoop in to address the failing water system, only for the problems to persist. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">We were chatting at Themba’s kitchen table. She has warm eyes and curly snow-white hair, which she’d gathered in a high bun. That day, she and other local advocates were still reeling from a recent hearing in which Judge Wingate accused them of being racist against Henifin, a white man, for challenging his governance of the water system. All they’d been agitating for, Themba said while stirring a pot on the stove, is transparency and community engagement.  She and other activists had initially been excited about the engineer, having heard from environmentalists in St. Louis that he had worked miracles there. But instead of a collaborative process, many Jackson residents and activists were shut out once Henifin established his private company to fix the city’s drinking water problem.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“I wish that the EPA’s behavior here in Jackson would reflect the goals and the principles that the Biden administration laid out,” Themba said. “They talk about community involvement and all these things, but that’s not what we’ve experienced.”</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“I’d say right now we’re in the worst position we’ve possibly been in since the EPA stepped in to help us,” said Tariq Abdul-Tawwab, the director of the Mississippi Rapid Response Coalition’s ground support team, which has been instrumental in mobilizing bottled water, filters, and lead testing kits to Jackson residents. Reflecting on the hearing with Judge Wingate, he continued, “When you’re being told you don’t have the right to ask questions, it’s the beginning of the end.”</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Outside the realm of advocacy and politics, the water crisis has become a part of daily life. Willie Williams, the owner of the local restaurant Sweet Spot, pays a monthly bill to upkeep a water filtration system he installed, because he can’t serve or cook with the tap water. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“It’s more than a crisis. I mean, it’s something that you have to add to your budget when you’re a business owner,” he said. “Water is very important.”</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Another Jackson resident, Lula Henry, who I’d been connected with by a member of the Mississippi Rapid Response Coalition, had recently come home to find her washroom and carport flooded after a group of city contractors blew open a hydrant while working on her street. When I pulled up to her house, furniture and cooking equipment lay scattered throughout the front yard, drying off in the sun. Like other residents I spoke to, Henry only uses the tap water in her house for cooking and bathing, and relies on bottled water for drinking and brushing her teeth. She called JXN Water to understand what happened. No one came to help.</p>, <p class=\"has-drop-cap has-default-font-family\">The drive from Jackson to south Louisiana takes about three hours, and shortly past the state line, the strips of pine forest flanking the highway give way to extensive swampland. After crossing the freshwater marsh at Lake Maurepas, I was finally in “Cancer Alley,” a stretch of land on the lower Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New Orleans where over 200 industrial facilities operate in the vicinity of historic Black neighborhoods. <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/report/2024/01/25/were-dying-here/fight-life-louisiana-fossil-fuel-sacrifice-zone\">Recent</a> <a href=\"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac4360\">studies</a> have confirmed what residents of the region have long said, that people living along the fence lines of these industrial operations suffer from higher-than-average rates of miscarriages, infertility, respiratory ailments, and cancer.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Under the system of air pollution regulation in the U.S., fighting the construction of new industrial facilities is difficult. Cleaning up existing ones is even harder. Amendments to the Clean Air Act passed by Congress in 1990 divided the country’s industrial landscape into different categories of facilities and gave the EPA a decade to develop a set of regulations for each. It was a momentous task that required agency staffers to collect emissions data for thousands of plants across the country and determine what technologies industrial companies should install to reduce the pollution. These new rules, while useful for reducing — though not eliminating — emissions from facilities without pollution controls, could only work at the margins of the health crisis taking shape in the country’s most industrial areas. As toxicologists often point out, in the case of potent cancer-causing chemicals like dioxins, <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2898056/\">no level of exposure</a> is considered safe. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“There’s nothing in the Clean Air Act itself that says a community has a right to be healthy and safe,” said Monique Harden, a former director at the Deep South Center for Environmental Law and Policy. “It’s a voluminous and very technical document that puts into law the status quo of industrial operations.” </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Scott Throwe, who spent 30 years working in the EPA’s enforcement division, remembers the 1990s as a time of great activity and immense pressure. Agency staffers were directed to write rules that wouldn’t generate much public comment controversy or lead to lawsuits from chemical companies. In their rush to finalize all the rules by statutory deadlines, certain community health protections fell through the cracks. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“It’s like watching a sausage get made. It’s not pretty, and we made a lot of sacrifices,” he recalled. “We couldn’t get perfect rules out, and sometimes they weren’t even very good. They were just OK.”</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">The amendments to the Clean Air Act also directed the EPA to revisit the slate of rules after eight years to assess the cancer risk that remained in communities. Many of these “risk assessments” were conducted under George W. Bush’s EPA, which adopted a far less protective standard of acceptable risk than prior administrations. Whereas the original text of the Clean Air Act said the EPA should strive to protect the public from pollution exposure with a cancer risk greater than 1 in 1 million, the Bush EPA began using the exponentially less protective standard of 1 in 10,000. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">While the Bush standard may seem fairly protective on its face, agency assessments only evaluate the cancer risk from a single chemical at a time. In reality, though, multiple plants operate simultaneously and in close proximity, releasing a slew of toxic chemicals on surrounding communities. The true cancer risk is cumulative.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">The task, then, of enforcing these standards lies with state governments. Regulators in state agencies have wide latitude to permit new industrial facilities, along with construction and operating permits, wherever they see fit, including in areas that are already highly polluted. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">When Regan came to Cancer Alley in November 2021, he visited Fifth Ward Elementary in St. John the Baptist Parish. The school sits in the shadow of the Japanese chemical company Denka’s synthetic rubber manufacturing plant. Regan told residents that the proximity of the facility’s toxic chloroprene emissions to the school <a href=\"https://www.desmog.com/2024/04/10/epa-chemical-rule-cancer-alley-environmental-justice-michael-regan-louisiana-sharon-lavigne-robert-taylor/\">reminded him</a> of his young son, and that the trip compelled him to use his “bully pulpit” to make change. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Later, Regan left for a tour of nearby St. James Parish. Among the group of activists, local residents, and reporters there to receive Regan and his staff was Sharon Lavigne, a local organizer. When he emerged from his travel bus, the sight of a sharply dressed Black man around the age of her son shocked Lavigne. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“I thought it would have been an all-white man with gray hair,” she said. “He was good-looking!”</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Regan expressed surprise at how close chemical storage tanks were to people’s homes. The administrator <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYOen4Ni7Pg\">promised</a> to buff up the EPA’s inspections of local facilities and require certain companies to install air monitors around their facilities.  </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">In early 2022, Lavigne’s organization, Rise St. James, and several other local environmental groups filed two separate civil rights complaints with the EPA. One complaint alleged that the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, or LDEQ, had behaved discriminatorily by granting permits to companies to build in the parish’s Black neighborhoods, such as the Taiwanese chemical group Formosa’s proposal for a plastics complex in St. James Parish. The other contested the state’s decision to let Denka continue operating in St. John, despite the EPA’s own data showing that the cancer risk it generated violated federal standards. During previous presidential administrations, the EPA had allowed such complaints to languish unresolved, but under Regan’s leadership, the agency opened a civil rights probe into conditions in Cancer Alley. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Federal and state officials <a href=\"https://grist.org/equity/civil-rights-cancer-alley-louisiana-epa/\">were making significant progress at the negotiating table</a> in the early part of 2023. Louisiana officials agreed to assess pollution levels in communities before greenlighting new industrial development. But then Attorney General Jeff Landry (who’s now governor of the state) sued the EPA and the Department of Justice, arguing that they were overextending their authority. A month later, the EPA closed its investigation.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">To Lavigne, the EPA’s handling of the civil rights complaints constituted a genuine attempt at improving conditions in Cancer Alley. Others I spoke to weren’t so generous. Lifelong St. James resident Melvin Whittington said the EPA’s actions in the region amounted to little more than “a front to make you think they’re doing something, but they’re not.” </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">With the civil rights probe closed, the EPA has run up against the extent of its power to do anything about the alleged discrimination in Formosa’s permitting. As for Denka, an EPA lawsuit against the company has been slowly making its way through the court system while the facility continues emitting the highly carcinogenic chemical chloroprene. In June, the NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund sued the St. John the Baptist school board for violating its Civil Rights-era desegregation order by exposing the majority-Black student body to Denka’s toxic pollution — a tactic that exposes why the dynamics inherent to the hopeful phrase “environmental justice” are sometimes referred to with the more unforgiving phrase “environmental racism.”  </p>, <p>Melvin Whittington, left, said the EPA’s actions in Cancer Alley amounted to little more than “a front.” Whittington lives near the Denka synthetic rubber manufacturing plant, right. <em><strong>Lylla Younes / Grist</strong></em></p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Considering these developments, Whittington wondered aloud whether the organizing they’d committed themselves to in Cancer Alley had even been effective. His words seemed to echo the sentiments of residents I’d spoken to in Jackson, who’d said that for all the resources and attention from the EPA, meaningful change was still elusive. “Doesn’t seem like we’re getting nothing done,” he said.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Five days after I left Cancer Alley, the St. John school board <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/denka-elementary-school-5th-ward-cancer-alley-d8c1307c780f7c457b745f16cf042450\">voted to shut down Fifth Ward Elementary</a>. </p>, <p class=\"has-drop-cap has-default-font-family\">On the morning of <a href=\"https://grist.org/politics/a-stormy-election-day-in-southwest-louisiana/\">Election Day</a>, I headed west toward Lake Charles, Louisiana, passing through sprawling fields of soybean and sugarcane under an overcast sky. The serpentine Calcasieu River forms the city’s northern border, and across it lie the industrial town of Westlake and the community of Mossville. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">I’d been here before, back in 2021, when I sat on the plush couch of Debra Sullivan Ramirez’s dimly lit living room, just a month before Regan’s tour. Sullivan Ramirez grew up in Mossville and moved to the city of Lake Charles in the late 1980s to get her three children away from the pollution, which she attributed to the lesions that had formed on their skin. As I sat with Sullivan Ramirez and two of her friends, discussing the string of diseases that had stalked her family, she handed me a stack of documents she’d saved over the years — newspaper clippings detailing fires and explosions at local plants, permit files, emissions registers — evidence of a place under siege. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Over the past several decades, the greater Lake Charles-Mossville area has transformed into a transnational oil and gas hub, with new pipelines, liquified natural gas terminals, and industrial plants rising up out of the swamp and filling the air with the din of construction and the sweet odor of synthetic chemicals. In 2001, the South African chemical company Sasol, whose plant outside of Johannesburg is the biggest single emitter of carbon dioxide in the world, began building an ethane cracker in Mossville to produce ethylene. Sasol didn’t begin the industrial takeover of the town — that had started as far back as the 1940s — but it exacerbated the problems. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">After deciding to expand its complex to include an ethylene cracker and a gas-to-liquid plant, Sasol began making offers to buy the properties of Mossville residents, but <a href=\"https://www.humanrightsnetwork.org/projects/mossville-displacement\">a study has shown</a> that the company offered significantly less money to Black homeowners, many of whom trace their ancestry back to the founding of Mossville by formerly enslaved people. Some residents decided to take the buyouts anyway, and some decided to stay.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">There are four things that the people of Mossville still want, Sullivan Ramirez told me: a lifetime of health insurance, free education, enough money to buy a proper home, and a memorial to honor everyone who’d died with cancer and liver failure. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Once called <a href=\"https://www.afpm.org/newsroom/blog/ethylene-worlds-most-important-chemical\">“the world’s most important chemical,”</a> ethylene is used to manufacture everything from food packaging and airplane engines to polyester and drainage pipes. Toxic as it may be to create, it is an essential ingredient to modern life. But as Mossville learned, some people have to pay a higher price for it. A 2000 study from the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/11/04/erasing-mossville-how-pollution-killed-a-louisiana-town/\">found</a> that the level of dioxins in Mossville residents’ blood was triple the national average.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">When Regan’s tour bus pulled into Mossville that November, members of the Concerned Citizens of Mossville, a local advocacy group, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/12/20/touring-louisianas-chemical-ghost-town\">showed him around</a>. As they drove, one person asked Regan whether he was wearing a face mask to protect himself from COVID or from the air pollution. “Both, in this case,” he replied.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“It’s astonishing to see the level — the presence — of industry surrounding this community,” <a href=\"https://www.kplctv.com/video/2021/11/19/us-epa-administrator-michael-regan-visits-mossville-journey-justice-tour/\">Regan told reporters later that day.</a> </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">When I returned to Sullivan Ramirez’s house this fall, she was dismayed by the EPA’s actions since Regan’s visit. In January 2022, Regan <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-administrator-regan-announces-bold-actions-protect-communities-following-journey\">announced funding for increased air and water monitoring</a> in Mossville, but little else. Companies were rarely fined, or paid minimal amounts, for breaching federal emissions standards, and most importantly, people felt as though there was no way out. (Sasol, which earned $275 billion in 2024, reached a $1.4 million settlement with EPA last April for a string of violations, including a chemical fire at the facility). “EPA is just trying to pacify us. They’ve done nothing but ignore the community folk and what they want,” Sullivan Ramirez said. “We want true change.”</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Today, the roads leading into Mossville are lined with abandoned homes with faded for-sale signs. As I approached, the air became acrid and I felt a familiar pressure in my nose, a sign of my proximity to petrochemical pollution. In the parking lot of the old community rec center, a man on a four-wheeler approached and asked what I was doing there. When I said I was a reporter, he waved me off and began driving away.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“Are you from Mossville?” I quickly asked. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">He said he didn’t want to talk, that people like me came through from time to time and took pictures of the plants looming over people’s homes — and then they left. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">But, he said, he’d been living there all his life. His mother’s home was down the road. The rec center was still open, he said, and if I stayed long enough I might see some kids playing ball. Sure, many folks had left. But for some, he made clear, Mossville was still home.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Mossville seemed to represent more clearly than anywhere I’d visited the terminus of unchecked industrial growth, the final result of a regulatory system administered by industry-friendly state governments and overseen by a federal agency with little power to do anything to upset business as usual. A well meaning EPA, like Biden and Regan’s, could offer an ear to communities in the crossfire or require companies to use better technology and hang up air monitors. But in a place like Mossville, the root of the injustice — a massive chemical complex — is left unchecked.</p>, <p>A playground sits in the shadow of a petrochemical facility in Mossville, Louisiana. More clearly than anywhere I’d visited, Mossville seemed to represent the terminus of unchecked industrial growth. <em><strong>Lylla Younes / Grist</strong></em></p>, <p class=\"has-drop-cap has-default-font-family\">Heading west from Mossville, the problem of pollution hotspots remains starkly apparent on the Texas Gulf Coast, where 10-lane highways fill the air with smog and dozens of industrial companies operate close together and share pipelines, storage infrastructure, and export docks. Regan traveled these highways on his way to Houston’s Fifth Ward, the last stop on the Journey to Justice. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">The neighborhood is framed by plants that make concrete along Interstate 45 to the west and metal recyclers dotting Interstate 69 to the east. A cancer cluster, defined as a greater-than-expected number of cancer cases in a particular area, <a href=\"https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/energy-environment/2024/03/29/482063/cancer-causing-chemicals-exceed-normal-levels-near-union-pacific-railyard-epa-says/\">was identified in the community</a>, linked to a toxic plume of creosote in the soil. The site is currently owned by Union Pacific Railroad, which acquired it in a merger with the Southern Pacific Railroad in the 1990s. A <a href=\"https://www.houstonhealth.org/media/3296/download\">2020 Houston Health Department study</a> of the Fifth Ward found that more than 40 percent of the households surveyed had at least one cancer case. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Regan visited two churches and an elementary school in the Fifth Ward. He sat in the front yard of local activist Sandra Edwards’ home, and listened as she detailed the experience of living on contaminated earth. She wanted more than just a reduction in pollution levels. Like Sullivan Ramirez in Lake Charles, Edwards demanded restitution for the harm already done to residents’ health. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“We shouldn’t have to go all the way to the medical center across town,” she told him. “We should bring a facility to this neighborhood for people.”</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Regan promised Fifth Ward residents what he had other communities on the tour — air monitoring, stronger enforcement, and better oversight of the state regulator. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“EPA is exploring ways that we can legally read the Clean Air Act in a way that allows us to take into consideration some of these external factors,” he said. “Do we believe that there’s some vulnerabilities there if people want to challenge us in court? Possibly. But the only way to find out is to test it.”</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Longtime Houston resident Leticia Gutierrez left her corporate job for a position at Air Alliance Houston, an environmental justice advocacy organization, after her son was diagnosed with childhood asthma. Administrator Regan’s visit was meaningful, she said, particularly for the residents he met with, who have long family histories of cancer. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">At the start of Regan’s term, Air Alliance Houston had really believed that change would come, but, Gutierrez said, “Here we are, four years later, with not much to really speak of.” The industrial facilities surrounding Houston kept up their steady work: In 2023, the city’s smog levels violated health-based standards on 55 days, more than any other year since 2011.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“We have access to EPA now,” she continued, “but what has that actually translated to?” </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">One thing that the EPA did do, in November, was to release its <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/cumulative-impacts/interim-framework-advancing-consideration-cumulative-impacts\">Interim Framework for Advancing Consideration of Cumulative Impacts</a>, which the agency opened for community feedback. Once the document is finalized, it will provide guidance for local governments to better understand and mitigate the effects of cumulative pollution. That framework, however, will amount to little more than words of advice to state agencies unless a successive EPA administrator moves it forward.</p>, <p class=\"has-drop-cap has-default-font-family\">On the last day of my trip, I drove back east to a city that Regan skipped over — Port Arthur, Texas, which is 75 percent non-white and is one of the country’s most important fossil fuel export hubs, where thousands of cubic feet of fracked gas are loaded onto tankers and shipped to Europe each year. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">I was on my way to meet with John Beard, an environmental advocate and former chemical industry worker who’s now known for giving his own kind of tours. We were joined by a group of European climate activists traveling between hotspots of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">We piled into Beard’s car and drove through the old downtown toward the industrial infrastructure along the coast. Abandoned buildings lined the streets around the city hall. In the surrounding neighborhoods, many homes had boards or plastic sheets instead of windows — damage from past hurricane seasons. Beard began listing facts about the city’s petrochemical history.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">The first refineries in Port Arthur were built in 1903, he said, and the only time they ever stopped operating was during Hurricane Harvey in 2017. The two largest refineries in the country were located there, within 15 miles of each other. Beard worked as an operator at the one owned by Exxon Mobil for 38 years. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">As we crested a bridge overlooking the patchwork of industrial complexes in western Port Arthur, he rolled down the windows.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“You’re smelling wood particles that are laced with formaldehyde,” he informed us, gesturing toward a wood pellet manufacturing facility just out of view.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">For several hours, we drove between the different industrial operations in town, stopping to photograph hundred-foot flares and smokestacks emitting billowing steam. Across the river from Sempra Energy’s new liquified natural gas terminal, a group of fishermen were reeling in their daily catch while a pelican perched on a railing nearby, eying them cautiously. According to data from the Texas Cancer Registry, cancer rates among Black residents in Jefferson County, which encompasses Port Arthur and the industrial city of Beaumont to the north, are around 15 percent higher than the state average.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">The cruel irony of all the Gulf Coast’s industrial corridors — that mere miles away from neighborhoods where people are too financially stressed to repair their hurricane-damaged homes, the world’s highest revenue-generating companies operate — seemed particularly pronounced in Port Arthur. Workers come from “lily white” suburbs, Beard explained, while locals struggle to make ends meet. The city’s poverty rate hovers around 30 percent, nearly triple the national average. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">It’s the same formula I had seen again and again, in the towns Regan visited and in the dozens of others he hadn’t. It’s a problem bigger than the Southern U.S., one that spans Midwestern cities like Gary, Indiana, and southwestern villages like Murray Acres, New Mexico; places where people’s health and futures had been sacrificed for industries that promised to make the country more prosperous and comfortable to all.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">It’s also a problem bigger than the EPA. With approvals from elected officials, industrial companies will always set up shop where it’s most profitable for them to: alongside deepwater ports, near natural resource deposits, and in areas where infrastructure like pipelines and roads already exist. The EPA’s job, then, is to somehow regulate the ever-expanding anatomy of industrial America. Its mandate does not require it to consider the necessity or risks of an operation before it comes into being; only to ensure that operation remains in compliance with federal standards. Regan’s EPA tightened many of these rules, requiring for the first time, for example, that synthetic chemical manufacturers monitor the air near their plants. But in a place like Port Arthur, where different kinds of pollution sources operate in the same industrial sprawl, clotting the air and coloring the water, no amount of overhauled regulations (which take years to come into effect) can make it safe. Perhaps this is the most we can expect of the EPA, regardless of whom the president is: incremental progress in the form of pollution-source rule updates, too slow to match the churn of economic growth. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">I reached out to Administrator Regan to get his thoughts on what I’d heard as I retraced the path he took four years prior. I also requested an interview with Earthea Nance, the administrator of EPA Region 6, which includes Texas and Louisiana. Neither would meet with me, their press secretaries informed me. They were busy wrapping up their terms and preparing for the holidays, the national office’s spokesperson said, but I could look out for a documentary about the tour soon to be published on the agency’s website. It would answer most of my questions, he assured me. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">The video, however, told a familiar story in American politics. Regan decried the environmental pollution he witnessed as “unacceptable anywhere in the United States of America.” And then he championed government funding as the solution. “At EPA, we have designed billions of dollars in grant programs, billions of dollars being invested into our infrastructure to ensure that every single person — no matter the money in your pockets, the color of your skin, or the ZIP code you live in — will have access to clean water, clean air, and safe and healthy lands.” Ultimately, the video betrayed no concern about the threat to such funding under Donald Trump’s next term; nor did Regan himself speak directly to the root of the pollution — industrial activity. “The journey to justice continues,” Regan concluded. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Our final stop on Beard’s tour was a refinery owned by Motiva, a U.S. subsidiary of a Saudi company, separated from a single house by a levee, a weak creek, and a road — maybe 100 feet. Beard knew the woman who lived there, and wondered if she was home. All along the levee, signs warned passersby of the highly pressurized natural gas pipeline that ran under their feet. Long white cushions had been laid across the ditch; Beard asked us to guess what they were. Nobody offered any.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Oil absorbers, he said finally, laid down to absorb the crude oil that floated into the creek. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“What are we making this sacrifice for?” Beard asked. “It is certainly not doing us any good.”</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\"><em>Correction: An earlier version of this article misidentified the company responsible for soil pollution in Houston’s Fifth Ward neighborhood. It was the Southern Pacific Railroad, which was later acquired by Union Pacific Railroad.</em></p>, <p></p>, <p>A message from   <svg class=\"site-logo__logo\" viewbox=\"0 0 305 103\">\n",

Great, I thought, convenience culture is killing us.But is it? This is the problem with the slew of research finding microscopic shards of plastic in our arteries, kidneys and livers, the findings that our oceans, food, soil and air are teeming with tiny bits of Tupperware. Scientists still don’t know what this plastic is doing to us. And because research takes time, while scientists are trying to answer question, we just keep inhaling, eating and drinking tiny pieces of plastic.On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.Why? Regulatory action has never really stopped the U.S. plastics industry from cranking out more plastic, even as clean air and water advocates try to fight the industry’s pollution problems in court and locals wage grassroots wars to slow the permitting of more plants that spew all those toxic chemicals. And now, back in office, is a president beholden to fossil fuel interests (where petroleum and natural gas are plastics precursors), a leader who uses his new powers to demand the use of plastic straws, and an administration that is hell-bent on crippling EPA’s mission to keep us safe rather than empowering it.Meanwhile, we do not know what all this plastic is doing to us. And no one currently in charge seems to care.Everything that goes into our bodies gets filtered through our livers and kidneys, so maybe it’s not a big surprise that bits of plastic find their way into those organs. Same with our hearts; microplastics end up in our blood and can get stuck in our clogged arteries. But our brains are designed to keep things out, through something called the blood-brain barrier. The researchers behind the brain plastics study think the tiny shards of plastic hitch a ride on fat molecules to get inside brain cells. And what’s worse is how much microplastics the researchers think might be in a whole human brain: 10 grams. Imagine 2.5 teaspoons of sugar. Now sub in plastic. Gross.They looked at preserved brains from about a decade ago and compared them to brains from last year. The fresher brains had more plastic in them than the older brains. And yes, they accounted for all the plastic needed to hold and manipulate the brains in their study, just in case those tubes and such were leaching plastic. So, year after year, surrounded by more and more plastic, our bodies are at minimum, storage tanks, and at worst, under an unrelenting attack.How is this even happening? Chemistry. Capitalism. Convenience culture. To make plastic, petroleum refineries isolate hydrocarbons and then crack those hydrocarbons into even smaller compounds like ethylene or propylene. They then do a little chemistry to stick those smaller compounds into repeating structures called polymers. These polymers then juiced with other chemicals that give them different properties, to mold them into plastics that are bendy, plastics that are hard, plastics that are resistant to heat and other things.Each year, millions of tons of plastic waste ends up in the ocean, with some plastics taking an estimated 1,000 years to decompose. Over time, larger pieces of plastic break down into microplastics, which can accumulate in marine life and possibly enter the human food chain.puttapon/Getty ImagesIn the face of renewable energy and electric cars charging up all over the country, lowering demands for gas, this is how our fossil fuel industry diversifies. And to great success; the U.S. produced 130 billion pounds of plastics in 2023. Chemists try to find cleaner and greener ways to make (and break down) plastic, but its manufacture is a dirty process. So, here we are, surrounded by this stuff that will never go away, slowly building up inside us.Thousands of plastics exist, each with its own recipe of chemicals. Since the EPA generally regulates individual chemicals, and not groups of chemicals based on what they do, going after every single component of plastics is basically impossible. Instead, under the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Biden administration started the process of regulating chemicals with known health effects that are also plastics precursors and additives. But this process could take years, and its fate looks dicey in the new administration. EPA’s single-chemical approach is what tobacco researchers called in a recent Scientific American piece a whack-a-mole strategy. A tweak here, a tweak there, and now EPA has one more plastics mole to whack.So many moles, a push to build more refineries, and our general inability to recycle plastic, and here we are, slowly becoming Homo plasticus.Scary, yes. But dangerous?Probably.There are oodles of studies that show that microplastics cause biochemical changes in cells and animals that we also see in humans who have various illnesses. All that said, cells are not people, and animals are models for what we think is happening in people.But recently, a group of Italian researchers followed 257 people who had plaque in their carotid arteries. They found that 20 percent of the people in their study who had microplastic-laden plaque had had a heart attack, stroke or had died after almost three years, compared to 7.5 percent of the people who didn’t. In studies of cells, those with microplastics in them also tended to show biochemical signatures of inflammation. And those people who had microplastics in their carotid arteries also tended to show some of those same signatures more often than the people who didn’t.So, yes, while correlation does not equal causation, these are fairly alarming signs. Yet we live in a country that believes wholeheartedly that we just keep doing what we are doing while we figure it all out. Meanwhile people in the shadows of plastics plants in Louisiana get cancer. Fish, the meat that was supposed to save our hearts, is teeming with plastic that we know now can end up clogging our arteries. The brains of people with dementia are full of plastic.So, recycle all your plastic containers! Cancel your food delivery! Take bags to the grocery store! All wonderfully insidious ways that we shift the responsibility of environmental calamity onto individuals. Don’t fix the problem of wasteful and destructive plastics chemistry, just tell people to stop using the product.Meanwhile, entire countries are trying to stop using so much plastic. And some places in the U.S. ban certain plastics. We could be like Maine, which makes large companies that use plastic help pay to deal with the waste. The responsibility for plastic is not just the consumer’s.I see pictures all the time of beaches covered in plastic pebbles, landfills overflowing with water bottles, and giant dumps of technology products with their sad beige plastic shells. Chemistry is a beautiful thing. When it comes to plastic, when are we going to hold the petrochemical industry accountable for this ugliness?This is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American.Rights & PermissionsMegha Satyanarayana is chief opinion editor at Scientific American, where she writes the column Cross Currents.

Same with our hearts; microplastics end up in our blood and can get stuck in our clogged arteries. But our brains are designed to keep things out, through something called the blood-brain barrier. The researchers behind the brain plastics study think the tiny shards of plastic hitch a ride on fat molecules to get inside brain cells. And what’s worse is how much microplastics the researchers think might be <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00405-8#:~:text=Campen%2C%20who%20is%20at%20the,weight%20of%20an%20unused%20crayon.\">in a whole human brain</a>: 10 grams. Imagine 2.5 teaspoons of sugar. Now sub in plastic. Gross.</p>, <p class=\"\" data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\">They looked at preserved brains from about a decade ago and compared them to brains from last year. The fresher brains had more plastic in them than the older brains. And yes, they accounted for all the plastic needed to hold and manipulate the brains in their study, just in case those tubes and such were leaching plastic. So, year after year, surrounded by more and more plastic, our bodies are at minimum, storage tanks, and at worst, under an unrelenting attack.</p>, <p class=\"\" data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\">How is this even happening? Chemistry. Capitalism. Convenience culture. To make plastic, petroleum refineries isolate hydrocarbons and then crack those hydrocarbons into even smaller compounds like ethylene or propylene. They then do a little chemistry to stick those smaller compounds into repeating structures called polymers. These polymers then juiced with other chemicals that give them different properties, to mold them into plastics that are bendy, plastics that are hard, plastics that are resistant to heat and other things.</p>, <p>Each year, millions of tons of plastic waste ends up in the ocean, with some plastics taking an estimated 1,000 years to decompose. Over time, larger pieces of plastic break down into microplastics, which can accumulate in marine life and possibly enter the human food chain.</p>, <p>puttapon/Getty Images</p>, <p class=\"\" data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\">In the face of renewable energy and electric cars charging up all over the country, lowering demands for gas, this is how our fossil fuel industry diversifies. And to great success; <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/203398/total-us-resin-production/\">the U.S. produced</a> 130 billion pounds of plastics in 2023. Chemists try to find cleaner and greener ways to make (and break down) plastic, but its manufacture is <a href=\"https://www.clf.org/blog/how-plastic-is-made/\">a dirty process</a>. So, here we are, surrounded by this stuff that will never go away, slowly building up inside us.</p>, <p class=\"\" data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\">Thousands of plastics exist, each with its own recipe of chemicals. Since the EPA generally regulates individual chemicals, and not groups of chemicals based on what they do, going after every single component of plastics is basically impossible. Instead, under the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-toxic-substances-control-act\">Toxic Substances Control Act</a>, the Biden administration started the process of regulating chemicals with known health effects that are <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-begins-process-prioritize-five-chemicals-risk-evaluation-under-toxic-substances\">also plastics precursors</a> and additives. But this process could take years, and its fate looks dicey in the new administration. EPA’s single-chemical approach is what tobacco researchers called in <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-tobacco-companies-use-chemistry-to-get-around-menthol-bans/\">a recent <i>Scientific American</i> piece</a> a whack-a-mole strategy. A tweak here, a tweak there, and now EPA has one more plastics mole to whack.</p>, <p class=\"\" data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\">So many moles, a push to build more refineries, and our <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/challenging-big-oils-big-lie-about-plastic-recycling/\">general inability to recycle plastic</a>, and here we are, slowly becoming <i>Homo plasticus</i>.</p>, <p class=\"\" data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\">Scary, yes. But dangerous?</p>, <p class=\"\" data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\">Probably.</p>, <p class=\"\" data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\">There are oodles of studies that show that microplastics cause biochemical changes in <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304389421028302?dgcid=author\">cells</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405665024000702\">animals</a> that we also see in <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7068600/\">humans</a> who have various illnesses. All that said, cells are not people, and animals are models for what we think is happening in people.</p>, <p class=\"\" data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\">But recently, a group of Italian researchers <a href=\"http://nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed\">followed 257 people</a> who had plaque in their carotid <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed\">arteries</a>. They found that 20 percent of the people in their study who had microplastic-laden plaque had had a heart attack, stroke or had died after almost three years, compared to 7.5 percent of the people who didn’t. In studies of cells, those with microplastics in them also tended to show biochemical signatures of inflammation. And those people who had microplastics in their carotid arteries also tended to show some of those same signatures more often than the people who didn’t.</p>, <p class=\"\" data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\">So, yes, while correlation does not equal causation, these are fairly alarming signs. Yet we live in a country that believes wholeheartedly that we just keep doing what we are doing while we figure it all out. Meanwhile people <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-race-to-stop-a-plastics-plant-scores-a-crucial-win/\">in the shadows of plastics plants</a> in Louisiana get cancer. Fish, the meat that was supposed to save our hearts, <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9819327/#:~:text=The%20ingestion%20of%20microplastics%20has,fish%20%5B23%2C63%5D.\">is teeming with plastic</a> that we know now can end up clogging our arteries. The brains of people with dementia are <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03453-1.pdf\">full of plastic</a>.</p>, <p class=\"\" data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\">So, recycle all your plastic containers! Cancel your food delivery! Take bags to the grocery store! All wonderfully insidious ways that we shift the responsibility of environmental calamity onto individuals. Don’t fix the problem of wasteful and destructive plastics chemistry, just tell people to stop using the product.</p>, <p class=\"\" data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\">Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/katharinabuchholz/2024/07/04/the-countries-banning-plastic-bags-infographic/\">entire countries</a> are trying to stop using so much plastic. And some places in the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/environment-and-natural-resources/state-plastic-bag-legislation\">ban certain plastics</a>. We could be like Maine, which makes large companies that use plastic <a href=\"https://www.nrcm.org/programs/sustainability/epr-for-packaging/#:~:text=On%20July%2012%2C%202021%2C%20Maine,Stay%20Informed%20about%20Sustainability\">help pay to deal with the waste</a>. The responsibility for plastic is not just the consumer’s.</p>, <p class=\"\" data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\">I see pictures all the time of beaches covered in plastic pebbles, landfills overflowing with water bottles, and giant dumps of technology products with their sad beige plastic shells. Chemistry is a beautiful thing. When it comes to plastic, when are we going to hold the petrochemical industry accountable for this ugliness?</p>, <p class=\"\" data-block=\"sciam/paragraph\"><i>This is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of </i>Scientific American.</p>, <p><b><a class=\"bioLink-kqdDv\" href=\"/author/megha-satyanarayana/\">Megha Satyanarayana</a></b> is chief opinion editor at<i> Scientific American, </i>where she writes the column Cross Currents.

      "The concept of biophilia truly inspiring, as it emphasizes bringing the essence of the natural world into our indoor spaces. Before covid came in and changed our relationship with our homes and how we nurture our space, biophilic design has been around to re-work how me look at our relationship with nature. Introduced by biologist Erich Fromm in 1964, biophilia captures our innate love for life and nature. This connection explains why so many of us experience joy and peace in outdoor settings. By integrating nature into our environments, we can create spaces that nurture our well-being and reflect our deep-rooted affinity for the earth.\n",
      "The psychological benefits of biophilia are profound, offering stress relief and cognitive improvements. For those passionate about nature, these benefits underscore the importance of living in harmony with the environment. As we navigate modern life, the six elements of biophilic design provide a roadmap to blend nature seamlessly into our daily experiences. This approach not only enhances our surroundings but also fosters a more meaningful connection with the natural world.\n",
      "1. Environmental Features\n",
      "Incorporating environmental features into biophilic design is essential for enhancing our connection to nature. By introducing elements such as vegetation, water, sunlight, and natural materials, indoor spaces become more inviting and harmonious. The use of potted plants, wooden furniture, and textured finishes not only beautifies interiors but also creates a calming environment. Earthy tones further enhance this effect, while open-concept layouts facilitate a seamless integration of these natural elements, fostering a soothing and enriching atmosphere.\n",
      "These environmental features play a crucial role in transforming urban spaces into nature-inspired sanctuaries. Natural light and ventilation improve air quality and energy efficiency, while the presence of greenery and water features can significantly boost mood and productivity. By mimicking the sensory experience of the outdoors, these elements provide a much-needed refuge from the fast-paced urban lifestyle. Ultimately, biophilic design with its environmental features nurtures both physical and mental well-being, creating spaces that promote tranquility and balance.\n",

      "Omri Cohen, a student at Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design, created the Living Shell, an innovative architectural design using textile technology. This shell, made from woven jute, felt, and wheatgrass over a bamboo frame, provides insulation and shade while continuing to grow. Cohen’s 1:10 scale models demonstrate the potential for this structure to serve as a natural refuge for small animals and an educational tool for observing natural growth processes. The Living Shell can be integrated into both urban and rural environments, with an irrigation system to support its development.\n",

      "The ACQUAIR combines a smart humidifier with a plant pot, using a single water tank to nourish the plant and emit moisture into the air. Equipped with sensors, it automatically adjusts mist levels based on temperature and humidity, ensuring optimal air quality with minimal maintenance. This dual-purpose design integrates nature and technology, enhancing both air purification and room aesthetics.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Olus is a compact, biophilic air purifier designed for small urban spaces, featuring fully biodegradable filters to cut down on landfill waste. Its nature-inspired design includes a moss-covered exterior and organic patterns. The two-stage filtration system uses dried moss and a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter to clean the air, while a digital display shows air quality and temperature. Olus combines eco-friendliness with modern aesthetics for effective air purification.\n",
      "2. Natural Shapes and Forms\n",
      "Natural shapes and forms play a vital role in biophilic design by mirroring the organic patterns found in nature, such as botanical motifs, spirals, and arches. These elements bridge the gap between indoor environments and the natural world, fostering a sense of harmony and connection. By avoiding rigid right angles and straight lines, which are rare in nature, these designs create spaces that feel more fluid and organic, enhancing overall well-being.\n",
      "Incorporating natural shapes and forms into design helps create environments that resonate with our innate affinity for nature. These elements evoke the beauty and complexity of the natural world, providing visual and emotional comfort. Curved lines and organic patterns can soften spaces, making them feel more inviting and less artificial. This approach not only enhances aesthetic appeal but also supports a calming atmosphere, promoting a deeper connection to the natural environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Respyre is an innovative bio-receptive technology company that has developed eco-concrete to support moss growth on concrete surfaces. This technology addresses urban challenges such as decreased biodiversity, heat stress, and pollution by transforming concrete structures into green spaces. Respyre’s eco-concrete features unique properties like porosity and nutrient content, allowing moss to grow without harming the underlying structure. Unlike costly and high-maintenance green roofs, this self-sustaining solution offers a practical way to integrate greenery into urban environments, improving air quality and enhancing cityscapes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Plant Prefab and UK-based Koto have collaborated to create LivingHomes, two eco-friendly residences that merge Scandinavian minimalism with biophilic design principles. Meeting LEED Platinum and net-zero standards, these homes utilize recycled materials, energy-efficient systems, and low-flow fixtures. The first home, Yksi, features a cantilevered, two-bedroom design with large windows and expansive decks for natural light and privacy. The second home, Piha, offers four bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a spacious open living area with courtyards and decks that provide panoramic views of the surrounding nature. Both homes are designed to integrate seamlessly with their environments, enhancing residents’ connection to the natural world.\n",
      "3. Natural Patterns\n",
      "Natural patterns are at the heart of biophilic design, capturing the essence of growth and aging as seen in the natural world. By mimicking these patterns, designers can create spaces that resonate with the organic processes found in nature. Materials like brass with its patina, oxidized metals, and aged leather exemplify this approach, showcasing unique textures and evolving colors that add depth and character to environments, reflecting the beauty of natural change.\n",
      "In biophilic design, natural patterns not only enhance aesthetic appeal but also foster a connection to the rhythms of nature. These patterns celebrate the passage of time and the unique beauty that comes with aging, offering a visual narrative of transformation. By incorporating elements that echo these natural processes, spaces become more dynamic and engaging, encouraging occupants to connect with the environment on a deeper, more intuitive level.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Aureole wall lighting collection draws inspiration from sunflower disk florets, blending natural forms with a unique, almost alien design. Crafted from quartz sand using advanced 3D printing, the lamps feature intricate, maze-like patterns. When illuminated, the opaque black disc at the center casts mesmerizing, spiral shadows, creating an ethereal, solar eclipse effect. This striking design captures the essence of nature while serving as a captivating conversation piece.\n",
      "4. Light and Space\n",
      "Light and space are integral components of biophilic design, significantly impacting mood and productivity. Maximizing daylight in interiors helps create bright, airy environments that mimic the comforting glow of natural settings, such as forests or starlit skies. By strategically placing large windows and mirrors, spaces can capture and amplify sunlight, ensuring an abundance of natural illumination. This approach not only enhances visual appeal but also strengthens the connection between indoor environments and the natural world.\n",
      "Incorporating light and space in biophilic design also involves using elements like glass chandeliers to reflect and disperse light, adding depth and warmth to interiors. These reflective surfaces can evoke a sense of openness and continuity, blurring the lines between indoor and outdoor spaces. This design strategy fosters a harmonious atmosphere that supports well-being and creativity, allowing occupants to experience the soothing and invigorating effects of natural light within built environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Jungle, designed by Poland’s KABO & PYDO, merges a light fixture with a planter in a sleek, capsule-shaped design. Suspended from the ceiling by long fabric straps, it features an opaque body that diffuses a warm, golden light and highlights the greenery. This dual-function piece combines biophilic design with modern aesthetics, offering both soothing illumination and a stylish way to incorporate plants into any living space.\n",
      "5. Place-Based Relationships\n",
      "Place-based relationships in biophilic design emphasize the integration of local culture, materials, and ecology into the built environment, creating spaces that resonate with their surroundings. By embracing vernacular architecture, designers utilize local materials and traditional building techniques, which not only reduce environmental impact but also celebrate the unique character of a place. This approach allows buildings to harmonize with their natural settings, whether nestled among mountains, along rivers, or in arid desert landscapes, fostering a sense of belonging and continuity with the environment.\n",
      "Incorporating local artwork and cultural elements further strengthens place-based relationships in biophilic design. These artistic expressions capture the essence of a region’s history, traditions, and values, enriching the narrative of a space and deepening the connection between occupants and their surroundings. By highlighting regional history and culture, biophilic design creates environments that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also meaningful and contextually relevant. This fosters a deeper appreciation for the local ecology and promotes a sense of stewardship and responsibility toward preserving and enhancing the natural and cultural heritage of a place.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Playground Restaurant by Loop Design Studio in Chandigarh blends brutalist and modernist design with lush greenery to create a whimsical greenhouse feel. Featuring an irregular cinder block wall with potted plants and vintage Edison bulbs, a translucent glass ceiling, and cozy wooden tables, the space combines industrial elements with biophilic design. Audio cassette tapes and terracotta flooring with cobalt blue tiles add unique touches, making the restaurant a vibrant oasis in the city’s concrete landscape.\n",
      "6. Evolved Human-Nature Relationship\n",
      "Biophilic design evolves the human-nature relationship by recreating environments that echo the natural world, fostering a deep connection to nature. By integrating elements such as natural light, organic materials, and greenery, these designs provide spaces that feel protective and nurturing. This approach taps into our inherent affinity for nature, offering a sense of security and comfort reminiscent of natural shelters, thereby enhancing emotional well-being and reducing stress in modern, built environments.\n",
      "Furthermore, biophilic design encourages a harmonious coexistence with nature by embedding natural elements into daily life. This design philosophy not only improves aesthetic appeal but also nurtures physical and mental health, fostering a deeper appreciation for the environment. By creating spaces that blend seamlessly with their surroundings, biophilic design cultivates a sense of stewardship and responsibility, inspiring individuals to engage more consciously with the natural world and prioritize sustainable practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "KRADS, a Danish-Icelandic architectural studio, designed a holiday home in southwestern Iceland that exemplifies biophilic design. Integrated into the mountainous terrain overlooking Lake Þingvallavatn, the home features staggered concrete foundations that harmonize with the natural landscape. Its green rooftops, adorned with moss and local grasses, enhance the connection to the surrounding woodland. Inside, the design maximizes natural light and offers unobstructed views of the lake and the mountain Skjaldbreið, creating a serene environment that reflects the principles of biophilia by seamlessly blending indoor and outdoor spaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Playa Viva is an eco-resort in Juluchuca, Mexico, featuring treehouse-style villas with roofs inspired by Mobula Ray wings. Designed by Atelier Nomadic, the resort integrates into the natural landscape with structures made from Guadua bamboo, fishpole bamboo, and Cumaru timber. The villas are elevated on wooden stilts and feature hyperbolic roofs for sun and rain protection. Playa Viva operates off-grid, using solar energy and supporting local communities through health and education initiatives, while also contributing to sea turtle conservation via its La Tortuga Viva Turtle Sanctuary.\n",

Before covid came in and changed our relationship with our homes and how we nurture our space, biophilic design has been around to re-work how me look at our relationship with nature. Introduced by biologist Erich Fromm in 1964, biophilia captures our innate love for life and nature. This connection explains why so many of us experience joy and peace in outdoor settings. By integrating nature into our environments, we can create spaces that nurture our well-being and reflect our deep-rooted affinity for the earth.</p>, <p>The psychological benefits of biophilia are profound, offering stress relief and cognitive improvements. For those passionate about nature, these benefits underscore the importance of living in harmony with the environment. As we navigate modern life, the six elements of biophilic design provide a roadmap to blend nature seamlessly into our daily experiences. This approach not only enhances our surroundings but also fosters a more meaningful connection with the natural world.</p>, <p>Incorporating environmental features into biophilic design is essential for enhancing our connection to nature. By introducing elements such as vegetation, water, sunlight, and natural materials, indoor spaces become more inviting and harmonious. The use of potted plants, wooden furniture, and textured finishes not only beautifies interiors but also creates a calming environment. Earthy tones further enhance this effect, while open-concept layouts facilitate a seamless integration of these natural elements, fostering a soothing and enriching atmosphere.</p>, <p>These environmental features play a crucial role in transforming urban spaces into nature-inspired sanctuaries. Natural light and ventilation improve air quality and energy efficiency, while the presence of greenery and water features can significantly boost mood and productivity. By mimicking the sensory experience of the outdoors, these elements provide a much-needed refuge from the fast-paced urban lifestyle. Ultimately, biophilic design with its environmental features nurtures both physical and mental well-being, creating spaces that promote tranquility and balance.</p>, <p><noscript><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-531287\" data-jpibfi-post-excerpt=\"\" data-jpibfi-post-title=\"Biophilic Design Explained: 6 Elements for a Nature-Inspired Home\" data-jpibfi-post-url=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2025/01/27/biophilic-design-explained-6-elements-for-a-nature-inspired-home/\" data-jpibfi-src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2025/01/Elements-of-Biophilic-Design_23.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2025/01/Elements-of-Biophilic-Design_23.jpg\" width=\"1280\"/></noscript><img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload alignnone size-full wp-image-531287\" data-jpibfi-post-excerpt=\"\" data-jpibfi-post-title=\"Biophilic Design Explained: 6 Elements for a Nature-Inspired Home\" data-jpibfi-post-url=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2025/01/27/biophilic-design-explained-6-elements-for-a-nature-inspired-home/\" data-jpibfi-src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2025/01/Elements-of-Biophilic-Design_23.jpg\" data-src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2025/01/Elements-of-Biophilic-Design_23.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"960\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201280%20960%22%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"1280\"/><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\">\n",

      "Transportation sector emissions have accelerated the climate crisis – automobiles are the second-largest source of greenhouse gases and have nearly doubled since 1990 – but they may soon be thrown in reverse thanks to electric vehicles.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "New research from the International Council on Clean Transportation estimates global emissions from road transportation and liquid fuel consumption may peak at around 9 gigatonnes as soon as 2025 and then begin falling, plummeting to 7.1 Gt in 2050. This peak and subsequent decline is happening roughly 25 years earlier than the ICCT’s previous forecast, thanks to ambitious decarbonization policies being adopted around the globe.\n",
      "\n",
      "EVs are driving this remarkable turnaround, with policies adopted in six major markets since 2021 supercharging sales. In fact, transportation emissions reductions in just three of the largest-emitting markets – the United States, European Union, and China – are now projected to offset emissions growth in other countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Electric Vehicle Sales Accelerate On Smart Policy\n",
      "The ICCT notes accelerated EV deployment, thanks primarily to government policies adopted since 2021, will cumulatively avoid 23 billion tonnes of emissions through 2050. If governments achieve their transportation decarbonization targets, cumulative emissions will fall an additional 13 billion tonnes by 2050.\n",
      "\n",
      "This analysis tracks BNEF’s 2024 Electric Vehicle outlook, released in June 2024, which forecast global road transportation emissions would peak in 2029 under all current policies and trends. BNEF’s assessment may forecast a later peak but it also forecasts a deeper decline, falling to 6.27 Gt in 2035. BNEF’s assessment isn’t a one-to-one comparison to ICCT’s analysis since they aren’t comparing the exact same data, but the overall trend is clear - EVs are cutting transportation emissions at a rapid pace.\n",

Its analysis shows current commitments from nations still fall short of an EV deployment trajectory that hits transportation’s contribution to the Paris Agreement target limiting warming to well below 2C° – annual emissions would have to fall to 2.3 Gt by 2050. And peaking could be delayed if vehicle usage grows faster than anticipated, if existing policies are weakened, or if EV sales hit the brakes in major markets.\n",

      "Electric Vehicles Cut Consumer Costs, Add Trillions In Economic Growth\n",
      "The good news is EV sales have moved into the fast lane – global sales of EV and plug-in hybrid vehicles rose 25% in 2024 to pass 17 million vehicles, according to researchers at Rho Motion. That growth was largely due to EV sales rising 40% in China last year passing 11 million total sales, followed closely by 3 million across Europe and 1.8 million in the U.S. and Canada.\n",
      "That accounting follows the International Energy Agency’s Global EV Outlook, which forecast global EV sales would hit 17 million in 2024, and expects EVs to compose 50% of total global car sales by 2035. That pace would completely change the global auto industry and turn over fleets from gas-powered to EV, with 33% of all cars on the road in China and 20% of all cars on the road in the U.S. and EU being electric.\n",
      "Switching to an EV protects consumers from volatile fossil fuel prices. Charging an EV is cheaper than filling up a gas car, and cutting transportation costs can help companies reduce their costs and slow inflation – high oil and gas prices directly contribute to inflation through pain at the pump and caused roughly 40% of recent inflationary price increases across the U.S economy.EV charging station in northern Virginia.

      "And despite policy uncertainty, battery prices may fall below $100 per kilowatt-hour in 2025, which would pass the long-sought threshold where EVs become as cheap as a gas-powered car. Global average battery prices fell 20% to $115 per kWh in 2024 as production capacity increased, low-cost battery technologies started coming online, and low lithium costs pushed down overall battery prices. That trend isn’t going away any time soon – battery prices fell more than 90% from 2008 to 2023, and like other clean energy technology, overall EV prices will continue to fall as production increases and battery technologies mature.\n",
      "EVs are a massive investment opportunity for countries and automakers to tap – worldwide, the EV market is expected to be worth $8.8 trillion in 2030 and a whopping $56.7 trillion by 2050, with most of those sales being passenger EVs. Automakers have already committed to investing $1.2 trillion in EV and battery manufacturing by 2030, and that economic promise is booming across America with nearly $200 billion in manufacturing facilities already announced in just two years since Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act.\n",
      "The EV transition has become an economic engine, and the countries that invest in EV manufacturing could reap trillions in revenue. But the countries that weaken their policies and fall behind the EV race will weaken their automakers’ ability to compete around the world and lose out on sales to foreign competitors within their borders and in other markets.\n",
      "Cutting Transportation Emissions Clean Our Air, Saving Lives\n",
      "Cutting transportation emissions helps us all breathe easier – cars, trucks, and buses belch toxic air pollution like particulate matter, nitrogen oxide, and carbon monoxide that trigger asthma and damage our lungs, hearts, and brains. They’re also linked to heart attacks, stroke, cancer, and premature death.\n",
      "Analysis from the ICCT in 2019 found that tailpipe emissions from vehicles caused around 385,000 premature deaths worldwide in 2015, costing approximately $1 trillion in health impacts. People who live, work, or attend school near major roads appear to have higher rates of health problems and more severe issues associated with air pollution from vehicles.MIAMI - JULY 11:  Exhaust flows out of the tailpipe of a vehicle at , \"Mufflers 4 Less\", July 11, ...

      "Research has shown that driving an EV dramatically cuts air pollution compared to gas-powered vehicles, even if the electricity charging EV batteries comes from dirty fossil fuels like coal-fired power plants, and even when accounting for air pollution from manufacturing the EVs themselves.\n",
      "Everyone has the right to breathe clean air and EVs are cleaning our air while fighting the climate crisis.\n",
      "Policymakers Must Avoid Electric Vehicle Gridlock On The Road To Clean Cars\n",
      "EVs protect consumers from pain at the pump, cut air pollution in our neighborhoods, attract investment jobs, and confront the climate crisis.\n",
      "Policymakers across the world should avoid hitting gridlock on the road to cleaner cars – it’s a roadmap to creating freedom from volatile fossil fuel prices, creating manufacturing prosperity, good jobs, and cleaning the air we all breathe.\n",

This peak and subsequent decline is happening roughly 25 years earlier than the ICCT’s previous forecast, thanks to ambitious decarbonization policies being adopted around the globe.</p>, <p>EVs are driving this remarkable turnaround, with policies adopted in six major markets since 2021 supercharging sales. In fact, transportation emissions reductions in just three of the largest-emitting markets – the United States, European Union, and China – are now projected to offset emissions growth in other countries.</p>, <p>The ICCT notes accelerated EV deployment, thanks primarily to government policies adopted since 2021, will cumulatively avoid 23 billion tonnes of emissions through 2050. If governments achieve their transportation decarbonization targets, cumulative emissions will fall an additional 13 billion tonnes by 2050.</p>, <p>This analysis tracks BNEF’s 2024 Electric Vehicle outlook, released in June 2024, which forecast global road transportation emissions would peak in 2029 under all current policies and trends. BNEF’s assessment may forecast a later peak but it also forecasts a deeper decline, falling to 6.27 Gt in 2035. BNEF’s assessment isn’t a one-to-one comparison to ICCT’s analysis since they aren’t comparing the exact same data, but the overall trend is clear - EVs are cutting transportation emissions at a rapid pace.</p>, <p>Despite this progress, the ICCT notes we haven’t yet won the transportation emissions race.

      "An international group of researchers is calling on the United Nations to include the protection of Earth's orbit in the U.N.'s sustainable development goals.The researchers — led by experts from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the University of Plymouth in the U.K. and the University of Texas at Austin — think that adding space to the U.N.'s Agenda for Sustainable Development would strengthen the case for space protection, which has become a pressing topic in recent years.The advent of megaconstellations — fleets of hundreds or thousands of small satellites that provide internet connectivity or monitor the planet from above — has led to an exponential rise in satellite numbers. Some 15 years ago, barely a thousand satellites orbited the planet. That number has increased more than tenfold since and is expected to continue growing. As satellites reach the ends of their missions, they turn into dangerous debris that could collide with other orbiting objects, thus creating masses of debris fragments.\"Adding a Sustainable Development Goal [SDG] specifically for space would be a transformative step in safeguarding one of Earth's most vital environments,\" Melissa Quinn, general manager at space situational awareness company Slingshot Aerospace, who is part of the initiative, told Space.com. \"Space is no longer a limitless frontier; it is a finite resource under increasing pressure from human activity.\"\n",

      "In the nearly 70 years since the launch of history's first satellite — Russia's Sputnik — humankind has come to rely on space technology in many aspects of modern life, including TV broadcasts, internet connectivity and satellite navigation.\"This isn't just about protecting space for its own sake,\" Quinn said. \"It's about ensuring that the systems we rely on daily remain resilient, equitable and accessible for generations to come. A dedicated SDG would catalyze the global cooperation needed to meet this challenge head-on.\"Related: How often does the International Space Station have to dodge space debris?Get the Space.com NewsletterBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.This animation from the European Space Agency depicts the number of debris objects larger than 1 millimeter in Earth orbit. (Image credit: ESA)The U.N.'s Agenda for Sustainable Development, formulated in 2015, includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals. These include ending hunger and poverty; improving health care and education access for the global population; ensuring gender equality, access to clean water and sanitation; and protecting the climate.The researchers think one of the existing goals, in particular, is relevant to the space problem. SDG No. 14 focuses on the protection of marine life and covers the contamination of the world's oceans with plastic pollution. This hard-to-solve ecological problem resembles the growing issue of space debris.The researchers think that lessons learned from marine debris management could help prevent \"another planetary crisis before it is too late,\" they said in a statement.\"Not so long ago, our oceans were regarded as infinite resources to plunder and infinite sinks for our waste,\" Thomas Dowling, a lecturer in remote sensing and geospatial science at the University of Auckland in New Zealand, said in the statement. \"We now know that view was grossly mistaken — many marine environments are now barren wastelands, and more than eight million tons of plastic debris is estimated to enter the ocean every year.\"For years, space sustainability experts have been sounding alarm bells over the growing quantities of space debris hurtling around Earth. According to the European Space Agency, there are currently around 40,500 out-of-control space junk fragments larger than 4 inches (10 centimeters), up to 1.1 million pieces between 0.4 and 4 inches (1 to 10 cm), and an additional 130 million fragments smaller than 0.4 inches (1 cm).These fragments circle the planet at nearly 5 miles per second (8 kilometers per second), threatening to demolish everything in their way. Some experts are already warning that a dangerous phenomenon known as \"Kessler syndrome\" — an unstoppable cascade of collisions in which every smashup produces fragments that damage further spacecraft — is already underway.RELATED STORIES:— 6 types of objects that could cause space debris apocalypse— Solving space junk problem may require lasers and space tugs, NASA says— Private company wants to clean up space junk with 'capture bags' in Earth orbit\"The rapid rise in satellite deployments has led to an increasing risk of collisions and debris,\" Quinn said. \"In 2024, we saw a 17% year-over-year spike in the average number of close approaches in low Earth orbit per satellite. With over 12,500 spacecraft now orbiting our planet, including more than 3,300 inactive satellites, we need urgent, coordinated global action to ensure space is safe, sustainable, and secure.\"In addition to the space debris problem, atmospheric researchers are concerned about the potential effects of satellite reentries on Earth's atmosphere. The atmospheric burn-up of satellites during their fall to Earth produces aluminum oxide, which can destroy atmospheric ozone and alter Earth's albedo — its ability to reflect sunlight. Some think that, if left unmitigated, satellite air pollution could, decades from now, undermine the good work done by the ozone-protecting Montreal Protocol and exacerbate ongoing climate change.\n",

      "Half a century ago, America’s big cities were choking on smog; air quality there resembled the shocking conditions in Beijing or Delhi we see today. A 1973 photo of New York’s George Washington Bridge disappearing into smog showed the pollution that millions of Americans breathed every day. But what has happened since those grim, hazy days is a remarkable American success story.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Since that time, the air pollution has dropped by a whopping 78%. Today’s vehicles are 98%-99% cleaner for common pollutants like carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter than they were in 1975. These tremendous reductions have been linked to fewer respiratory illnesses, decreased hospital visits, and ultimately, lives saved and reducing climate impacts. How the U.S. went from grim, hazy days to dramatically cleaner air is a story of American technological innovation, well-designed policy, and steady progress over many years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The latest evidence from the 2024 EPA Automotive Trends Report is clear: this country can protect public health and save consumers at the pump through technological innovation, well-designed policy, and steady progress over many years. Model Year 2023 passenger cars now achieve an impressive average of 27 miles per gallon as fuel economy that has more than doubled since 1975 and new vehicles in 2023 emitted less than half the CO2 per mile of 1975 models.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the last several decades, the U.S. automotive industry has thrived under this regulatory framework. EPA’s regulations were successful because they didn’t compel auto companies to use any one technology. Instead, manufacturers can use any technological innovation that meets the EPA standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting the 1970s, Detroit emerged as a technological leader in both transportation emissions standards and innovative clean car technology. And because the innovative technologies developed here—like the catalytic converter and electronic fuel injection systems—became universally adopted, the regulations ultimately cleaned up emissions and saved lives around the world.\n",

      "It was once again American innovation that is credited with launching the world’s transition to electrification – Tesla. When launched in 2011, the Tesla S demonstrated that electric vehicles were not only “cool” but also practical and wonderful to drive. Last year, Tesla accounted for about half of US EV sales, and the Model Y was the best-selling EV in the entire world.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, China is leading the global electrification race today. It alone accounted for some 64% of global EV sales in 2024. Meanwhile, the EU is setting ambitious targets, including a mandate for all new vehicle sales to be zero-emission by 2035. In this context, the U.S. must sustain its momentum in clean vehicle technology to be able to compete and win in global markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Policies over the past four years have provided a needed boost to American competitiveness in the EV market. First, EPA once again instituted forward-looking clean car standards. Second, federal legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Bill provided billions in public investments in a wide range of programs, including funds for the development, installation, and maintenance of a nationwide network of EV charging stations; credits for the purchase of new and used electric vehicles; funding for electric vehicle and battery manufacturing facilities; and funding to increase the reliability of the electricity grid.\n",
      "Sales of electric vehicles (EVs) in the US have gone from 6.7% in 2022 to 11.5% in 2023 and more than 195,000 new jobs have been created. Automotive OEMs and suppliers are investing heavily in US in electric vehicle production as they see the future of global mobility to be electric. Globally car manufacturers have committed to invest as much as $1.2 trillion in transitioning the industry of which $ 312 billion is expected to come to the US. That shift will give the U.S. economy a competitive jumpstart, especially as we look to match the dominance of China and EU in EV sales.\n",
      "As the new Trump administration begins, there is concern that the clean car standards that have spurred so much success might face a roll back. But weakening environmental standards would not only stall environmental progress, but it would also weaken the ability of U.S. automakers to compete around the world—just as stronger emissions standards are becoming the global norm. And as the global automotive market continues to go electric, U.S. manufacturers would find themselves losing market share to competitors in more stable regulatory environments.\n",
      "For the U.S to compete in the fastest-growing segments of the automotive market, we must maintain this momentum. Rolling back emissions standards or reducing EV incentives would stall domestic progress and cede technological and economic leadership to global competitors.\n",
      "Instead, as we move forward, the new administration would find tremendous success in maintaining and enhancing clean car standards – it’s a strategy to lock in environmental progress, save hardworking consumers money at the pump, and spur our economic leadership.\n",
      "The new administration has an historic opportunity to capitalize on our momentum and leadership in the automative sector. The future of our economy, our health, and our planet depends on their choices in the months and years ahead.\n",

      "A recent video circulating on social media showed farmworkers in Ventura County, Calif. picking strawberries under a blood-orange sky because of smoke from the Hughes Fire in north Los Angeles County. \"That reddish light, there's something primal that – you really do – sort of your lizard brain recognizes that there's danger,\" says Elizabeth Strater, who is an organizer and national vice president for the United Farm Workers of America. Oxnard, a city in Ventura County, isn't prone to wildfires, but it is surrounded by mountains, which are prime agricultural land. Strater points out that those are \"also places that are prone to being affected by wildfire smoke.\" \n",

Drive a little north of the county and all of a sudden you're surrounded by green fields, rows of produce and farmworkers.  As the Hughes Fire tore through Northern L.A. County, thousands of farmworkers continued to pick strawberries, leafy greens and other produce in hazy smoke in Ventura County. California has some of the strongest regulations in the nation to protect farmworkers from wildfire smoke. It's one of only three states, along with Oregon and Washington, that require employers to provide masks to workers when the air quality reaches unhealthy levels. But the fact that many farmworkers labored through the smoke of the Los Angeles fires underscores the limitations of California's laws, worker advocates say. \n",

      "Unhealthy air conditions Parts of Northern L.A. and Ventura County had Air Quality Index (AQI) levels around 150 on Jan. 22 when the Hughes Fire erupted, turning the sky orange. But thousands of farmworkers continued to work in the fields. Studies show that when AQI levels hover between 100-200 on a smoky day, that air pollution is like smoking a quarter to a half pack of cigarettes a day. Air quality is considered \"good\" when the AQI is below 50. \n",

      "A new law that allows farmworkers to take sick days when the AQI reaches unhealthy levels took effect this year. But according to UFW spokesperson Antonio de Loera, workers feel the financial pressure to continue working during wildfires. The Department of Industrial Relations, an extension of CAL/OSHA, says employers in California are legally required to provide N95 respirators to workers when the AQI reaches 150, But it remains unclear how many employers actually do abide by the law, worker advocates say. The state of California doesn't have data about mask distribution by farmers. The agency declined to be interviewed, but did provide a statement. Denisse Gómez, a spokesperson from the state's Department of Industrial Relations says it has created worker safety and health regulations in wildfire regions and requires employers to protect workers from unhealthy air due to wildfire smoke and calls for specific training requirements. \"In California, it is illegal for employers to retaliate against workers for refusing to work in unsafe conditions, including in evacuation zones,\" the agency wrote. Farmworkers typically work between eight to 10 hours a day outside. It's hard physical work, so when it's smokey outside, workers are breathing in more smoke. \" They're working fast, they're trying to get all the produce into the bins because many of them are paid [at] a piece rate,\" says Michael Mendez, who teaches environmental policy and urban planning at the University of California, Irvine. \"The more that they're able to harvest and put in those bins, the more they're able to make money.\" But working in wildfire smoke can quickly impact the body, including causing headaches, lingering coughs and sore throats. According to California's Air Resources Board, wildfire smoke can worsen heart disease, asthma and lead to premature death. Wildfire smoke carries tiny particles known as PM2.5, which can be harmful when inhaled. \n",

Dominici says long-term exposure to low-level PM2.5 from freeways or construction – what she calls \"less toxic\" – causes fluid in the lungs, which leads to coughing. \"We can anticipate – unfortunately – a repeated exposure to high and more toxic levels of PM2.5 will also have an adverse health impact on the health system,\" Dominici says. The increasing toxicity of PM2.5 is linked to the fact that wildfires don't just burn forests anymore, but cars, buildings and appliances. All those things are made of materials that are highly toxic when they burn. Since January, L.A. County has seen a series of catastrophic wildfires causing billions of dollars in damage that one company estimates is around $250 billion and leaving more than 10 million people in unhealthy air conditions for several days. A rush against the fire As soon as the Hughes Fire in Northern Los Angeles County erupted Jan.22, the United Farm Workers and other community groups knew they had to deploy thousands of N95 respirators to farmworkers in Ventura County. The UFW scrambled to get help going. A mutual aid group answered the call, donating 20,000 respirators to help around 40,000 farmworkers laboring in wildfire smoke in cities including Oxnard, Camarillo and other agricultural hubs in the county. The labor union quickly found a truck to transport the masks from an L.A. warehouse to Ventura County. A group of around 100 volunteers well respected in the farmworker community helped to distribute between 150-200 N95's each to non-union represented workers around the county. Strater says union workers receive masks at job sites, while non-union workers often do not. Still, the workers are a tight knit community and look out for one another, she says. \" These are folks without a social safety net,\" Strater says. \"Even when you're under an evacuation warning, this is a group of people that's probably less likely to seek out support from a shelter, less likely to go to aid relief stations.\" \n",

      "\"There needs to be additional care, guidance and enforcement for these individuals that are at the front lines of this climate crisis and are continuing to work throughout these wildfires,\" he says. The outlook for California wildfires is grim so far. The state has seen little rainfall this year, and early forecasts anticipate a warmer late spring and early summer. According to UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain, that could lead to an early \"start\" for fireseason in Southern California – peak fire season can start as early as May and run through October. Climate change has made the planet hotter, with 2024 being the hottest year on record, and a warmer planet makes large destructive wildfires more likely. According to Sonja Diaz, who co-founded the Latina Futures 2050 Lab, COVID-19 showed that the federal government could not deploy information, resources and care quickly enough at the rate that historically excluded communities needed. She says that's why the trusted messengers for Black, Latino, Indigenous and other marginalized groups became community clinics, state hospitals, labor unions, nonprofits and mutual aid groups. \"In the aftermath of the fires and the devastation there remains this continued thread that these entities – non-governmental – are the ones able to deploy necessary relief, aid, support to meet people's basic needs,\" Diaz says. \"So the government really needs to start looking at this sector as a partner, investing in it, recognizing that it is a necessary element for keeping residents safe, communities healthy and the economy moving.\" Working with concern Farmworkers are concerned about their health, says Jorge Toledano, a community organizer at Mixteco Indígena Community Organizing Project (MICOP), a nonprofit that helps Indigenous migrant communities. \" But they have to work to feed their families, to pay rent,\" Toledano says in Spanish. \"They have no other choice but to work.\" Toledano says the nonprofit received more than 5,000 masks during the Mountain Fire in Ventura County last fall. MICOP's  rapid response team immediately mobilized to distribute between 1,000 and 2,000 N95 respirators during the Hughes Fire. \n",

      "The nonprofit uses Facebook, and a radio station called Radio Indigena, to broadcast in multiple Indigenous languages about the dangers of wildfire smoke, where to get N95s, and how to wear them. MICOP worked with other community organizations to create a smoke alert text system in 2019. Toledano says the organization is also educating workers to ask their employers for N95 masks when a wildfire breaks out. \"We don't know when there's going to be a fire, they happen so fast,\" Toledano says. \"But it's the employer's obligation to provide masks.\"\n",

      "Les matins où le froid hivernal nous fait regretter d’être sorti de notre lit, il est courant de voir certains automobilistes démarrer leur voiture pendant le dégivrage de leur vitres, pour que la mécanique se réchauffe. Cette tradition, transmise de génération en génération et souvent conseillée par les anciens garagistes, trouve ses racines dans une époque où la technologie automobile était bien différente. Mais les temps ont changé, et cette habitude pourrait désormais vous jouer de mauvais tours.\n",

      "Une pratique dépassée qui menace votre moteur Les moteurs modernes n’ont plus rien à voir avec ceux d’il y a trente ans. Équipés d’injection électronique sophistiquée et de multiples capteurs, ils ajustent en temps réel le mélange air-carburant selon la température. Les huiles actuelles, nettement plus performantes, assurent une lubrification quasi instantanée des pièces mécaniques. « Faire chauffer » son moteur à l’arrêt devient non seulement superflu, mais potentiellement nocif. Le véritable danger réside dans l’accumulation de carburant non brûlé. Quand le moteur tourne au ralenti à froid, la combustion est imparfaite. Les résidus de carburant se mélangent à l’huile moteur, diminuant progressivement ses propriétés lubrifiantes. Cette dégradation prématurée de l’huile peut entraîner une usure accélérée des composants mécaniques, particulièrement les segments de pistons et les parois des cylindres.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Le coût caché d’une fausse bonne idée Au-delà des dommages mécaniques potentiels, cette habitude impacte directement votre portefeuille. Un moteur qui tourne au ralenti pendant 10 minutes chaque matin consomme inutilement près d’un demi-litre de carburant. Sur trois mois d’hiver, cela représente plus de 45 litres de carburant gaspillé, soit l’équivalent de 80 euros partis littéralement en fumée alors que vous auriez pu l’utiliser pour vous déplacer. Mais la facture peut s’avérer encore plus salée. Peu d’automobilistes le savent, mais laisser tourner son moteur à l’arrêt est illégal en France. L’article R318-1 du Code de la route stipule qu’il est interdit de laisser tourner son moteur en stationnement. La plupart des experts recommandent de ne pas laisser son moteur tourner pendant un arrêt qui dure plus de 20 secondes. L’infraction est passible d’une amende de 135 euros. Cette mesure, initialement pensée pour lutter contre la pollution urbaine, s’applique aussi bien en ville qu’en zone rurale. La bonne méthode pour préserver son moteur La solution ? Démarrer et rouler immédiatement, mais en douceur. Les premiers kilomètres doivent se faire à régime modéré, sans brusquer la mécanique. C’est la meilleure façon de permettre à toutes les pièces du moteur d’atteindre progressivement leur température optimale de fonctionnement.\n",

      "Par temps très froid uniquement, un court temps de chauffe d’une à deux minutes peut se justifier, notamment pour les moteurs diesel. Mais au-delà, vous risquez plus de dégrader votre véhicule que de le préserver. Les constructeurs eux-mêmes le confirment : les voitures modernes sont conçues pour démarrer et rouler immédiatement, même par temps froid. La seule exception concerne les véhicules anciens, particulièrement ceux d’avant 1990. Leur conception moins sophistiquée peut nécessiter un temps de chauffe plus long. Mais pour l’immense majorité du parc automobile actuel, cette pratique appartient définitivement au passé.  Faire chauffer son moteur moderne à l’arrêt dégrade l’huile et accélère l’usure mécanique Cette habitude gaspille du carburant et peut coûter une amende de 135 euros La meilleure méthode : démarrer et rouler immédiatement en douceur pendant quelques minutes   📍 Pour ne manquer aucune actualité de Presse-citron, suivez-nous sur Google Actualités et WhatsApp.   Newsletter 🍋 Abonnez-vous, et recevez chaque matin un résumé de l’actu tech  Votre email :   Je m'inscris            \tJ'ai lu et accepte        \t          \tles termes et les conditions        \t    Laissez ce champ vide si vous êtes humain :  \n",

      "[<p>Le matin, avant de partir travailler, vous laissez tourner votre voiture quelques minutes pour « faire chauffer le moteur » ? Il faut arrêter.</p>, <p>Les matins où le froid hivernal nous fait regretter d’être sorti de notre lit, il est courant de voir certains automobilistes <strong>démarrer leur voiture pendant le dégivrage de leur vitres, pour que la mécanique se réchauffe</strong>. Cette tradition, transmise de génération en génération et souvent conseillée par les anciens garagistes, trouve ses racines dans une époque où la technologie automobile était bien différente. Mais les temps ont changé, et <strong>cette habitude pourrait désormais vous jouer de mauvais tours.</strong></p>, <p><a href=\"https://www.presse-citron.net/1-2-puretech-peugeot-propose-une-solution-pour-sen-debarrasser/\">Les moteurs modernes n’ont plus rien à voir avec ceux d’il y a trente ans</a>. Équipés d’injection électronique sophistiquée et de multiples capteurs, ils ajustent en temps réel le mélange air-carburant selon la température. Les huiles actuelles, nettement plus performantes, assurent une lubrification quasi instantanée des pièces mécaniques. <strong>« Faire chauffer » son moteur à l’arrêt devient non seulement superflu, mais potentiellement nocif.</strong></p>, <p>Le véritable danger réside dans l’accumulation de carburant non brûlé. Quand le moteur tourne au ralenti à froid, la combustion est imparfaite. Les résidus de carburant se mélangent à l’huile moteur, diminuant progressivement ses propriétés lubrifiantes. <strong>Cette dégradation prématurée de l’huile peut entraîner une usure accélérée des composants mécaniques</strong>, particulièrement les segments de pistons et les parois des cylindres.</p>, <p>Au-delà des dommages mécaniques potentiels, cette habitude impacte directement votre portefeuille. Un moteur qui tourne au ralenti pendant 10 minutes chaque matin consomme inutilement près d’un demi-litre de carburant. <strong>Sur trois mois d’hiver, cela représente plus de 45 litres de carburant gaspillé, soit l’équivalent de 80 euros partis littéralement en fumée alors que vous auriez pu l’utiliser pour vous déplacer.</strong></p>, <p>Mais la facture peut s’avérer encore plus salée. Peu d’automobilistes le savent, mais <strong>laisser tourner son moteur à l’arrêt est illégal en France. L’article R318-1 du Code de la route stipule qu’il est interdit de laisser tourner son moteur en stationnement</strong>. La plupart des experts recommandent de <strong>ne pas laisser son moteur tourner pendant un arrêt qui dure plus de 20 secondes</strong>. L’infraction est passible d’<strong>une amende de 135 euros</strong>. Cette mesure, initialement pensée pour lutter contre la pollution urbaine, s’applique aussi bien en ville qu’en zone rurale.</p>, <p>La solution ? Démarrer et rouler immédiatement, mais en douceur. <strong>Les premiers kilomètres doivent se faire à régime modéré, sans brusquer la mécanique</strong>. C’est la meilleure façon de permettre à toutes les pièces du moteur d’atteindre progressivement leur température optimale de fonctionnement.</p>, <p>Par temps très froid uniquement, un court temps de chauffe d’une à deux minutes peut se justifier, <a href=\"https://www.presse-citron.net/adblue-voici-une-excellente-nouvelle-pour-les-conducteurs-de-diesels-touches-par-les-pannes/\">notamment pour les moteurs diesel</a>. Mais au-delà, vous risquez plus de dégrader votre véhicule que de le préserver. Les constructeurs eux-mêmes le confirment : les voitures modernes sont conçues pour démarrer et rouler immédiatement, même par temps froid.</p>, <p>La seule exception concerne les véhicules anciens, particulièrement ceux d’avant 1990. Leur conception moins sophistiquée peut nécessiter un temps de chauffe plus long. <strong>Mais pour l’immense majorité du parc automobile actuel, cette pratique appartient définitivement au passé.</strong></p>, <p class=\"text-base text-neutral-700 dark:text-neutral-300\">📍 Pour ne manquer aucune actualité de Presse-citron, suivez-nous sur <a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBggKMIPiNTC70wU?hl=fr&amp;gl=FR&amp;ceid=FR%3Afr\" target=\"_blank\">Google Actualités</a> et <a href=\"https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaCkGuz4NViitBXbEr0b\" target=\"_blank\">WhatsApp</a>.</p>, <p class=\"text-2xl text-black dark:text-white font-extrabold\">Newsletter 🍋</p>, <p class=\"my-1 text-lg text-neutral-400 font-light\">Abonnez-vous, et recevez chaque matin un résumé de l’actu tech</p>, <p class=\"mt-3 text-sm\"> <label> <input name=\"AGREE_TO_TERMS\" required=\"\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"1\"/>        \tJ'ai lu et accepte        \t<a class=\"link-reset text-net\" href=\"/comment-sabonner-la-newsletter-presse-citron/\" target=\"_blank\">          \tles termes et les conditions        \t</a> </label> </p>, <p class=\"float-right\">\n",

      "The Trump administration has warned more than 1,100 Environmental Protection Agency employees who work on climate change, reducing air pollution, enforcing environmental laws and other programs that they could be fired at any time.\n",
      "An email, reviewed by The New York Times, was sent to staff members who were hired within the past year and have probationary status. Many of those employees were encouraged to join the E.P.A. under the Biden administration to rebuild the agency, which had been depleted during President Trump’s first term. Others are experienced federal workers who had taken new assignments within the agency.\n",
      "Many had been hired to work on programs that Congress created through two recent laws, doing things like helping communities replace lead pipes, mediating toxic sites and funding clean energy projects aimed at reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that are heating the planet.\n",
      "“As a probationary/trial period employee, the agency has the right to immediately terminate you,” the email states.\n",
      "Molly Vaseliou, an E.P.A. spokeswoman, said in a statement that “our goal is to be transparent.” She declined to answer questions about the email, though, including whether Lee Zeldin, the agency’s new administrator, intended to terminate employees and, if so, for what reason.\n",
      "“On his first day in office, he engaged directly with career staff across E.P.A.’s headquarters —spanning two city blocks in downtown D.C. — listening to their insights and perspectives,” Ms. Vaseliou said. “Ultimately, the goal is to create a more effective and efficient federal government that serves all Americans.”\n",
      "At 9:21 a.m. on Monday, E.P.A. employees received another email notifying them of that the agencywide intranet was out of service. Without the internal agency network, employees cannot access documents or other information needed for their jobs.\n",
      "The email from E.P.A.’s Office of Mission Support reads “Access to work.epa.gov is current unavailable” and that technical specialists were working to resolve the issue. It was not immediately clear if the outage was related to efforts to reduce the work force.\n",
      "Asked about the email, Ms. Vaseliou said “There was an outage.”\n",
      "Other federal agencies have been directed by the Office of Personnel Management to submit lists of probationary employees, but E.P.A. workers appear to be the first to receive notice that they may be immediately dismissed.\n",
      "Leaders at the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents unionized E.P.A. employees, called the move a clear attempt to gut an agency that Mr. Trump dislikes. Through the E.P.A., the Biden administration developed aggressive regulations to curb planet-warming pollution from power plants, automobiles and oil and gas wells.\n",
      "“E.P.A. is at the center of the bullseye for President Trump’s vindictive purge of public servants,” said Michelle Roos, executive director of the Environmental Protection Network, a group of agency alumni.\n",
      "She called it “the most chaotic and vindictive transition in the history of the Environmental Protection Agency.”\n",
      "Two E.P.A. employees who received the email said it had caused them to rethink the Trump administration’s offer to federal employees to resign but be paid through the end of September. The employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are concerned about being fired, said they had initially dismissed that offer as untrustworthy.\n",
      "Being informed that their jobs are particularly precarious has caused them to rethink their options, both said.\n",
      "Probationary employees are considered easier to fire because they do not have the full range of civil service protections, but rules still exist, said Marie Owens-Powell, president of the federation of government employees union, which represents about 8,000 E.P.A. workers.\n",
      "“There has to be cause, and the cause can’t be because you’re a Democrat and it’s a Republican administration,” Ms. Owens-Powell said. The union is consulting lawyers about whether the administration can fire workers based on a simple declaration of a change in agency priorities, she said.\n",
      "Ms. Owens-Powell said the Trump administration had placed about 15 E.P.A. employees who were working on diversity, equity and inclusion efforts on administrative leave. She said the next likely targets are those working on environmental justice, or programs to help marginalized communities that suffer from disproportionate amounts of air and water pollution.\n",
      "Staffing at the E.P.A. peaked in 2004 during the George W. Bush administration, when there were 17,611 employees, according to the agency. Those levels ebbed and flowed slightly, but began to take a sharp dip during the Obama administration amid Republican control of the House and Senate.\n",
      "When Mr. Trump entered the White House in 2017, the E.P.A. had 15,408 employees. The following year that number dropped to 14,172 as political appointees reversed regulations, shut scientists out of decision-making and shrank the agency’s budget.\n",
      "The Biden administration sought to reverse those losses. The agency currently employs about 15,130 people around the country, a level slightly higher than when Ronald Reagan was president.\n",

They measure exact frequencies of light — from the invisible infrared and ultraviolet to visible red, yellow, green and blue light — quickly and accurately.These Nobel Prize-winning devices fill an important technological gap. Optical frequency combs allow scientists to measure and control light waves as if they were radio waves. With optical frequency combs, technologies that employ radio and microwave frequencies — such as clocks, computers and communications — are now seamlessly connected to optical waves that oscillate at 10,000 times higher frequencies. Optical frequency combs began as part of NIST scientists’ vision for better optical atomic clocks in the late 1990s. Today, NIST scientists are at the forefront of advancing these tools, and they have found uses beyond just timekeeping.  \n",

      "By making a simple measurement, the optical frequency comb has changed science. So what can a comb do? A lot—and the possibilities are constantly expanding. \n",
      "\n",
      "How are optical frequency combs used?TimekeepingOptical frequency combs have been revolutionary for atomic clocks and timekeeping. Optical atomic clocks mark the passage of time by counting the natural oscillation of atoms in the same way a grandfather clock counts the swings of a pendulum. These atoms oscillate about 500,000 billion times a second — a much higher frequency than standard microwave-based atomic clocks. The current electronic systems that are used to measure frequency for microwave-based atomic clocks simply can’t count the optical “ticks.”Because the teeth of an optical frequency comb are evenly spaced and precise, the comb acts like the gears of a clock, taking the faster optical frequencies and dividing them down to the lower-frequency microwave signals used by electronics and current atomic clocks. This lets scientists link optical atomic clocks’ higher-frequency “ticks” to microwave-based clocks’ lower-frequency “ticks” and electronics used by present day computers and communications systems.   \n",

      "Optical frequency combs can act like gears in a clock, allowing scientists to easily translate high frequency optical frequencies to lower frequency microwaves and vice versa. They can even help scientists translate between different optical frequencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "With these “gears” carrying accurate signals between electronics, microwave-based tools and optical atomic clocks, scientists can use these powerful new clocks for faster, more accurate timekeeping systems. Optical atomic clocks may eventually redefine the second.In order for these new clocks to be used for national and global timekeeping, scientists need to be able to compare signals from clocks across distances. Optical frequency combs can help achieve that too. NIST and JILA, a joint research institute of NIST and CU Boulder, used lidar to send time signals through the air, comparing two different kinds of atomic clocks.Improved timekeeping systems are crucial in many technological applications, from stock trading to navigation. Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites and receivers send radio signals back and forth and use the timing of those signals to pinpoint a user’s location. GPS uses military time, and those clocks check their timing periodically with civilian clocks, like NIST’s optical atomic clocks and others like them around the world. Scientists hope to have optical atomic clocks on navigation satellites in the future, making the system even more precise and allowing GPS to pinpoint locations within centimeters.Optical atomic clocks are also useful in the pursuit of quantum physics. By dividing time into incredibly small slices, scientists can use these clocks to measure previously undetectable changes, such as the gravitational red shift over short distance scales, the effect of gravity on the passage of time. \n",

      "Astronomy and cosmologyAdvanced optical atomic clocks also allow scientists to study the constants of nature beyond our own planet. For example, with the help of optical frequency combs, NIST scientists are using these improved clocks to search for elusive dark matter. Optical frequency combs also are helping scientists search for exoplanets around distant stars. By tracking the exact colors of light from these stars, they can look for a wobble in the motion of a star that would indicate the presence of an Earth-like planet orbiting the star. Precise distance measurementOptical frequency combs work over long distances. In 2013, NIST patented lidar, a light detecting and ranging system that utilizes optical frequency combs to measure the distance to an object by analyzing light reflected from it. This is already being used in a few research applications. NIST’s fire research laboratory has used frequency combs to “see” through flames and identify melting objects. Frequency comb-based lidar has also been used to create 3D maps. Eventually, lidar using optical frequency combs could keep satellites and other space instruments flying in tight formations, acting as a single instrument. Atmospheric science and greenhouse gasesAtoms and molecules can be identified by which frequencies of light they absorb. Since optical frequency combs generate millions of frequencies in short pulses, they can be used to quickly and efficiently study the quantity, structure and dynamics of various molecules and atoms. This has many potential applications and is already being used to study pollution. Using optical frequency combs, scientists at JILA have studied short-lived molecules that link burning fossil fuels to air pollution. The structure and dynamics of large and complex molecules can also be probed by frequency combs. Scientists are also working on using optical frequency combs to detect trace amounts of various molecules in gases. In 2019, scientists and engineers from NIST, University of Colorado Boulder, and LongPath Technologies developed a dual-comb, portable spectroscopy system to detect minute methane emissions from oil and gas fields.\n",

The spectrometer sits in the center of a circle which is ringed with retroreflecting mirrors. Laser light from the spectrometer (yellow line) passes through a gas cloud, strikes the retroreflector and is returned directly to its point of origin. The data collected are used to identify leaking trace gases (including methane), as well as leak locations and their emission rates.\n",

      "Medical diagnosticsThe optical frequency comb may have applications in medicine as well. Just as it can be used in chemistry applications, the comb could be used to detect trace molecular indicators of disease. Scientists at JILA have been experimenting with combs to create breathalyzers that detect disease.How do optical frequency combs work?Frequency combs measure an unknown optical frequency by measuring the repetition rate of a continuous train of light pulses — which lies in the larger, easy-to-measure radio frequency range.Light encompasses a broad spectrum of colors, which travel in waves. Each of those colors of light — from the invisible infrared and ultraviolet to red, blue or yellow visible light — has a corresponding frequency, or the number of wave peaks that pass a fixed point every second. Radio waves and microwaves also travel at the speed of light, but their peaks are much farther apart, allowing modern electronics to count and track them easily.\n",

      "Optical frequency combs emit a continuous train of very brief, closely spaced pulses of light containing a million different colors, spanning from the invisible infrared through the visible and into the ultraviolet spectrum. Thanks to a technique called “mode locking,” all of the frequencies in each pulse start in phase, in sync with each other. The result resembles the teeth of a comb, separating each frequency into a distinct spike — hence the name of the device. The spacing of those teeth is very fine and exactly even, and they act like ticks on a ruler to measure light emitted by stars, atoms, other lasers, etc. with extreme precision and accuracy. \n",

      "How were optical frequency combs created?While they may sound simple, optical frequency combs are the result of decades of research and innovation, including significant contributions from NIST.Physicists had been toying with the idea of this specialized laser since the 1970s, when Theodor Hänsch of the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics in Germany proposed a model for the first optical frequency comb while he was at Stanford University. Scientists knew that continuous lasers could only produce one color of light, but pulsed lasers could generate multiple colors. The shorter the pulse, the more frequencies the laser could produce.Scientists needed to know the spacing between the “teeth” — the individual frequencies of light — of the comb. This required mode locking lasers. Mode locking forces all the colors in each pulse to start out in phase with each other. In the mid-1990s, lasers made with titanium-doped sapphire crystals could produce these synchronized frequencies in femtoseconds — millionth of a billionth of a second pulses.  \n",

      "Scientists also needed to calibrate the comb, to adjust it to a known frequency. Calibrating the comb would determine the offset frequency, or where the “ticks” on the comb start in an absolute sense. Hänsch realized that the best way to do that was to get the comb to produce an octave of frequencies, where the highest frequency was at least double the lowest frequency. Interfering a frequency with its double — called “self-referencing” — let scientists determine each frequency exactly. That wasn’t possible until a team of scientists at Bell Laboratories created a hair-thin optical fiber that could deliver more than an octave range of frequencies. This was a crucial development for optical frequency combs, and the final piece of the puzzle. With this optical fiber, Jan Hall and his colleagues at JILA could develop the self-referencing technique they needed in 1999. They were the first to compare the operation of multiple femtosecond frequency combs, thereby demonstrating reproducibility.Hall and his team of physicists at JILA, including Steven Cundiff, Scott Diddams, David Jones and Jun Ye, developed several other techniques that pushed the optical frequency comb closer to reality. In the late 1990s, the team developed a calibration system for the femtosecond laser, creating controllable, well-defined pulses containing thousands of colors. They had also improved stabilization for the laser, making it steady. In 2005, Hall and Hänsch shared part of the Nobel Prize in Physics for their contributions to the optical frequency comb. What’s next for optical frequency combs?Since 1999, NIST and JILA scientists have rapidly advanced the comb, and are still at the forefront of optical frequency comb advancement and innovation. Today’s optical frequency combs span a greater range of electromagnetic frequencies than their earlier counterparts, from the deep infrared into the extreme ultraviolet. The ultraviolet comb can one day be used to drive transitions in the nucleus of atoms, which would unlock new possibilities for clocks and spectroscopy to study the nano world. \n",

      "Fiber laser frequency combs were the next significant advance in optical frequency combs. NIST and JILA scientists contributed significantly to creating and refining these combs. Using common fiber components from telecommunications, these combs can operate continuously and are more compact than the original optical frequency comb. This makes them “workhorses” for metrology. They are currently used for numerous experiments (including clocks) in NIST and other laboratories, and in field applications like lidar and the aerospace industry. Fiber laser frequency combs are also being considered and tested to go into space. NIST scientists and engineers are continually improving fiber laser combs’ performance, power and durability to use in new applications and environments. While many frequency combs currently are about the size of a shoebox and are widely available for use in and outside of laboratories, scientists have been working diligently to shrink them. Scientists have been working to produce optical frequency combs so small they can fit on a microchip.  Many scientists hope that if frequency combs can fit on a microchip, they can have even greater commercial applications. Microcombs have the potential to improve communications systems, particularly within data centers and other high performance computing systems. The spectroscopy power of optical frequency comb could be incorporated into smartphones and wearable technology to monitor health. Those applications are far in the future, however. Currently microcombs require tools outside of the chip to operate, such as power supplies, amplifiers and pump lasers. Many of these parts have been miniaturized, but integrating them all onto a single chip is very challenging. But perhaps the greatest hurdle to overcome is making these microcombs self-referencing, which is necessary to make the combs accurate.Research is making progress to overcome those hurdles. Even if a complete comb-on-a-chip is never realized, microcombs are already finding uses in research. With miniature dual frequency combs, NIST has already developed a chip-scale atomic clock. Scientists at NIST and their collaborators will continue to explore the vast potential for microcombs, fiber laser frequency combs and optical frequency combs.Latest News \n",

They measure exact frequencies of light — from the invisible infrared and ultraviolet to visible red, yellow, green and blue light — quickly and accurately.</p>, <p>These Nobel Prize-winning devices fill an important technological gap. Optical frequency combs allow scientists to measure and control light waves as if they were radio waves. With optical frequency combs, technologies that employ radio and microwave frequencies — such as clocks, computers and communications — are now seamlessly connected to optical waves that oscillate at 10,000 times higher frequencies. </p>, <p>Optical frequency combs began as part of NIST scientists’ vision for better optical atomic clocks in the late 1990s. Today, NIST scientists are at the forefront of advancing these tools, and they have found uses beyond just timekeeping. </p>, <p> </p>, <p>Optical frequency combs have been revolutionary for atomic clocks and timekeeping. Optical atomic clocks mark the passage of time by counting the natural oscillation of atoms in the same way a grandfather clock counts the swings of a pendulum. These atoms oscillate about 500,000 billion times a second — a much higher frequency than standard microwave-based atomic clocks. The current electronic systems that are used to measure frequency for microwave-based atomic clocks simply can’t count the optical “ticks.”</p>, <p>Because the teeth of an optical frequency comb are evenly spaced and precise, the comb acts like the gears of a clock, taking the faster optical frequencies and dividing them down to the lower-frequency microwave signals used by electronics and current atomic clocks. This lets scientists link optical atomic clocks’ higher-frequency “ticks” to microwave-based clocks’ lower-frequency “ticks” and electronics used by present day computers and communications systems.  </p>, <p> </p>, <p>With these “gears” carrying accurate signals between electronics, microwave-based tools and optical atomic clocks, scientists can use these powerful new clocks for faster, more accurate timekeeping systems. Optical atomic clocks may eventually redefine the second.</p>, <p>In order for these new clocks to be used for national and global timekeeping, scientists need to be able to compare signals from clocks across distances. Optical frequency combs can help achieve that too. NIST and JILA, a joint research institute of NIST and CU Boulder, used lidar to <a data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"d37b61de-c674-43fb-bde7-0fd5106b0d24\" href=\"/news-events/news/2021/03/nist-team-compares-3-top-atomic-clocks-record-accuracy-over-both-fiber-and\" title=\"NIST Team Compares 3 Top Atomic Clocks With Record Accuracy Over Both Fiber and Air\">send time signals through the air</a>, comparing two different kinds of atomic clocks.</p>, <p>Improved timekeeping systems are crucial in many technological applications, from stock trading to navigation. Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites and receivers send radio signals back and forth and use the timing of those signals to pinpoint a user’s location. GPS uses military time, and those clocks check their timing periodically with civilian clocks, like NIST’s optical atomic clocks and others like them around the world. Scientists hope to have optical atomic clocks on navigation satellites in the future, making the system even more precise and allowing GPS to pinpoint locations within centimeters.</p>, <p>Optical atomic clocks are also useful in the pursuit of quantum physics. By dividing time into incredibly small slices, scientists can use these clocks to measure previously undetectable changes, such as the gravitational red shift over short distance scales, the effect of gravity on the passage of time. </p>, <p>Advanced optical atomic clocks also allow scientists to study the constants of nature beyond our own planet. For example, with the help of optical frequency combs, NIST scientists are using these improved clocks to <a data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"d37b61de-c674-43fb-bde7-0fd5106b0d24\" href=\"/news-events/news/2021/03/nist-team-compares-3-top-atomic-clocks-record-accuracy-over-both-fiber-and\" title=\"NIST Team Compares 3 Top Atomic Clocks With Record Accuracy Over Both Fiber and Air\">search for elusive dark matter</a>. </p>, <p>Optical frequency combs also are helping scientists search for exoplanets around distant stars.

Mode locking forces all the colors in each pulse to start out in phase with each other. </p>, <p>In the mid-1990s, lasers made with titanium-doped sapphire crystals could produce these synchronized frequencies in femtoseconds — millionth of a billionth of a second pulses.  </p>, <p>Scientists also needed to calibrate the comb, to adjust it to a known frequency. Calibrating the comb would determine the offset frequency, or where the “ticks” on the comb start in an absolute sense. Hänsch realized that the best way to do that was to get the comb to produce an octave of frequencies, where the highest frequency was at least double the lowest frequency. Interfering a frequency with its double — called “self-referencing” — let scientists determine each frequency exactly. </p>, <p>That wasn’t possible until a team of scientists at Bell Laboratories created <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1364/OL.25.000025\">a hair-thin optical fiber</a> that could deliver more than an octave range of frequencies. This was a crucial development for optical frequency combs, and the final piece of the puzzle. With this optical fiber, Jan Hall and his colleagues at JILA could <a data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"0f020386-aafa-4bd2-b3ec-f19994ffc609\" href=\"/nist-and-nobel/jan-hall\" title=\"Jan Hall\">develop the self-referencing technique</a> they needed in 1999. They were the first to compare the operation of multiple femtosecond frequency combs, thereby demonstrating reproducibility.</p>, <p>Hall and his team of physicists at JILA, including Steven Cundiff, Scott Diddams, David Jones and Jun Ye, developed several other techniques that pushed the optical frequency comb closer to reality. In the late 1990s, the team developed a calibration system for the femtosecond laser, creating controllable, well-defined pulses containing thousands of colors. They had also improved stabilization for the laser, making it steady. In 2005, Hall and Hänsch shared part of the <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2005/summary/\">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> for their contributions to the optical frequency comb. </p>, <p>Since 1999, NIST and JILA scientists <a href=\"https://www.osa-opn.org/home/articles/volume_32/january_2021/features/combs_of_light_on_a_chip/\">have rapidly advanced the comb</a>, and are still at the forefront of optical frequency comb advancement and innovation. Today’s optical frequency combs span a greater range of electromagnetic frequencies than their earlier counterparts, from the deep infrared into the extreme ultraviolet. The ultraviolet comb can one day be used to drive transitions in the nucleus of atoms, which would unlock new possibilities for clocks and spectroscopy to study the nano world. </p>, <p>Fiber laser frequency combs were the next significant advance in optical frequency combs. NIST and JILA scientists <a data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"1bb8d337-ef36-4095-9a05-9d49fe1e252b\" href=\"/programs-projects/fiber-optic-frequency-comb-development\" title=\"Fiber-optic Frequency Comb Development\">contributed significantly</a> to creating and refining these combs. Using common fiber components from telecommunications, these combs can operate continuously and are more compact than the original optical frequency comb. This makes them “workhorses” for metrology. They are currently used for numerous experiments (including clocks) in NIST and other laboratories, and in field applications like lidar and the aerospace industry. Fiber laser frequency combs are also being considered and tested to go into space. NIST scientists and engineers are continually improving fiber laser combs’ performance, power and durability to use in new applications and environments. </p>, <p>While many frequency combs currently are about the size of a shoebox and are widely available for use in and outside of laboratories, scientists have been working diligently to shrink them. Scientists have been working to produce optical frequency combs <a data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"fa0e3d2e-9c24-4e62-aa1f-98ce1e742dae\" href=\"/news-events/news/2011/10/future-comb-chip-nists-compact-frequency-comb-could-go-places\" title=\"Future 'Comb on a Chip': NIST's Compact Frequency Comb Could Go Places\">so small they can fit on a microchip</a>.  </p>, <p>Many scientists hope that if frequency combs can fit on a microchip, they can have even greater commercial applications. Microcombs have the potential to improve communications systems, particularly within data centers and other high performance computing systems. The spectroscopy power of optical frequency comb could be incorporated into smartphones and wearable technology to monitor health. </p>, <p>Those applications are far in the future, however. Currently microcombs require tools outside of the chip to operate, such as power supplies, amplifiers and pump lasers. Many of these parts have been miniaturized, but integrating them all onto a single chip is very challenging. But perhaps the greatest hurdle to overcome is making these microcombs self-referencing, which is necessary to make the combs accurate.</p>, <p>Research is making progress to overcome those hurdles. Even if a complete comb-on-a-chip is never realized, microcombs are already finding uses in research. With miniature dual frequency combs, NIST has already developed a <a data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"b9dd8c04-bd6d-43b9-a522-9ca6649c2be7\" href=\"/news-events/news/2019/05/nist-team-demonstrates-heart-next-generation-chip-scale-atomic-clock\" title=\"NIST Team Demonstrates Heart of Next-Generation Chip-Scale Atomic Clock\">chip-scale atomic clock</a>. Scientists at NIST and their collaborators will continue to explore the vast potential for microcombs, fiber laser frequency combs and optical frequency combs.</p>, <p>\n",

      "In contemporary architecture, white has emerged as a dominant force, transforming skylines and redefining modern building aesthetics. As an architectural enthusiast tracking global design trends, I’ve witnessed white emerge as more than just a color choice — it’s become a powerful tool in the contemporary designer’s arsenal. The resurgence of white architecture transcends mere aesthetics, representing a sophisticated intersection of parametric design, material innovation, and environmental consciousness. From Herzog & de Meuron’s minimalist masterpieces to BIG’s geometric wonders, leading architects are leveraging white’s unique properties to push the boundaries of form and function.\n",
      "What fascinates me most is how white has evolved from its Modernist roots to become a catalyst for technological advancement in building design. Today’s white structures incorporate photocatalytic coatings, thermochromic materials, and advanced polymer composites that respond to environmental conditions. This marriage of time-honored design principles with cutting-edge materials science exemplifies how contemporary architecture is adapting to meet 21st-century challenges. Let’s explore why this deceptively simple color continues to dominate architectural discourse.\n",
      "1. Clean Aesthetic\n",
      "The clean, simple appearance of white buildings offers a striking contrast to natural surroundings and embodies modern design principles of simplicity. Beyond the visual appeal, white buildings represent a shift towards sustainable architecture. Modern white structures often incorporate eco-friendly materials and energy-efficient designs. Architects increasingly choose white finishes not just for aesthetics but also for their environmental benefits. This trend is particularly evident in urban developments where white buildings create visual breaks in dense cityscapes, offering a sense of spaciousness and serenity amid busy surroundings.\n",

      "The ONCO Capsule House embodies a futuristic design with its sleek, white exterior and rounded shape. Unlike traditional tiny homes made of wood or repurposed trailers, this concept features a science fiction-inspired interior with strip lighting and modern panels. The capsule’s circular form, while less practical for stacking or grids, creates a spacious feel and offers options for transparent, tint-controllable windows.\n",
      "2. Reflects Light\n",
      "White reflects natural light, brightening spaces and keeping them cool by reducing heat gain. Its use on roofs further enhances this effect, especially in hot, desert regions. This light-reflecting property has significant environmental implications. Studies show that white buildings can reduce cooling costs by up to 20% in warm climates. Cities like Athens, Greece, and Miami, Florida, have implemented initiatives encouraging white building facades to combat urban heat island effects. The strategy has proven particularly effective in Mediterranean and tropical regions, where traditional white architecture has been a practical solution for centuries.\n",

      "Casa Caoba is an open-air tiny house in Anapoima, Colombia, designed by PAE, featuring a white facade that blends seamlessly with its lush hillside location. Supported by a stone foundation, its minimalist design includes five parallel walls creating four living areas with open walls for natural airflow. Built from local stone, bamboo and timber, the home features a minimalist kitchen, dining area, relaxation terrace with a plunge pool and a master bedroom with an open-air bathroom.\n",
      "3. Timeless Look\n",
      "White is a classic color with a timeless appeal as it never goes out of style or becomes a fleeting trend. The enduring appeal of white architecture traces back to ancient civilizations, from Greek temples to Moorish palaces. Contemporary architects continue this legacy while incorporating modern technologies and materials. White’s timeless quality also makes it a safe investment for property developers, as it maintains its appeal across different architectural trends and cultural contexts.\n",

The origami-inspired design ensures stability and visual appeal while minimizing environmental impact. Inside, dynamic, mirror-enhanced interiors maximize natural light, and the exterior’s weather-resistant, white aircraft-grade aluminum panels blend seamlessly with various landscapes.\n",
      "4. Resists Fading\n",
      "White paint is UV-resistant and won’t fade when exposed to light, maintaining its appearance over time. The durability of white exteriors extends beyond mere aesthetics. Modern white building materials incorporate advanced nanotechnology and self-cleaning properties. For example, photocatalytic white coatings can break down pollutants and maintain their brightness through chemical reactions activated by sunlight. This technology, first developed in Japan, is now being adopted globally, particularly in high-pollution urban environments where building maintenance is a significant concern.\n",

      "The Zayed National Museum, designed by Foster + Partners, is an upcoming landmark in Abu Dhabi featuring five sculpted wings that naturally cool the interior. Unveiled in 2010, the design honors UAE’s first president, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, inspired by falconry and Islamic motifs. The 98-foot-tall mound structure and steel wings function as chimneys to expel hot air and draw in fresh air.\n",
      "5. Emphasizes Space and Form\n",
      "White highlights the building’s form and structure, focusing on design over color and accentuating its volume. Architects are increasingly using white as a tool for sculptural expression in building design. The color’s ability to highlight shadows and create depth perception makes it ideal for complex geometric forms. This characteristic has become particularly valuable in contemporary architecture, where buildings often serve as cultural landmarks. Notable examples include Santiago Calatrava’s works, where white surfaces emphasize the flowing, organic forms that have become his signature style.\n",

The 100-meter-tall tower, inspired by the Baroque style, will have a semi-open facade with a removable membrane for weather protection. The project showcases advanced robotic 3D printing techniques, using a specialized concrete mixture that optimizes structural integrity while minimizing material waste.\n",
      "6. Versatile for Any Design Style\n",
      "White facades provide a timeless look that suits any design style, blending seamlessly with materials like glass, concrete and steel. The adaptability of white extends to interior-exterior transitions, creating seamless visual flows. Contemporary architects often use white as a unifying element to bridge different architectural styles and materials. This versatility is particularly valuable in historic district renovations, where new structures must harmonize with existing architecture while maintaining their modern identity. The color’s neutrality allows for bold architectural statements without overwhelming neighboring buildings.\n",

The resurgence of white architecture transcends mere aesthetics, representing a sophisticated intersection of parametric design, material innovation, and environmental consciousness. From Herzog &amp; de Meuron’s minimalist masterpieces to BIG’s geometric wonders, leading architects are leveraging white’s unique properties to push the boundaries of form and function.</p>, <p>What fascinates me most is how white has evolved from its Modernist roots to become a catalyst for technological advancement in building design. Today’s white structures incorporate photocatalytic coatings, thermochromic materials, and advanced polymer composites that respond to environmental conditions. This marriage of time-honored design principles with cutting-edge materials science exemplifies how contemporary architecture is adapting to meet 21st-century challenges. Let’s explore why this deceptively simple color continues to dominate architectural discourse.</p>, <p>The clean, simple appearance of white buildings offers a striking contrast to natural surroundings and embodies modern design principles of simplicity. Beyond the visual appeal, white buildings represent a shift towards sustainable architecture. Modern white structures often incorporate eco-friendly materials and energy-efficient designs. Architects increasingly choose white finishes not just for aesthetics but also for their environmental benefits. This trend is particularly evident in urban developments where white buildings create visual breaks in dense cityscapes, offering a sense of spaciousness and serenity amid busy surroundings.</p>, <p><noscript><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-535171\" data-jpibfi-post-excerpt=\"\" data-jpibfi-post-title=\"The Modern White Aesthetic Trend: 8 Designs That Showcase Why Architects Love This Classic Color\" data-jpibfi-post-url=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2025/02/15/the-modern-white-aesthetic-trend-8-designs-that-showcase-why-architects-love-this-clean-classic-color/\" data-jpibfi-src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2025/02/why-white-color-is-dominating-modern-building-design/White-Colour_Architecture_Buildings_Importance_31.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2025/02/why-white-color-is-dominating-modern-building-design/White-Colour_Architecture_Buildings_Importance_31.jpg\" width=\"1280\"/></noscript><img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload alignnone size-full wp-image-535171\" data-jpibfi-post-excerpt=\"\" data-jpibfi-post-title=\"The Modern White Aesthetic Trend: 8 Designs That Showcase Why Architects Love This Classic Color\" data-jpibfi-post-url=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2025/02/15/the-modern-white-aesthetic-trend-8-designs-that-showcase-why-architects-love-this-clean-classic-color/\" data-jpibfi-src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2025/02/why-white-color-is-dominating-modern-building-design/White-Colour_Architecture_Buildings_Importance_31.jpg\" data-src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2025/02/why-white-color-is-dominating-modern-building-design/White-Colour_Architecture_Buildings_Importance_31.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"960\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201280%20960%22%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"1280\"/><div class=\"code-block code-block-1\" style=\"margin: 8px 0; clear: both;\">\n",

Unveiled in 2010, the design honors UAE’s first president, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, inspired by falconry and Islamic motifs. The 98-foot-tall mound structure and steel wings function as chimneys to expel hot air and draw in fresh air.</p>, <p>White highlights the building’s form and structure, focusing on design over color and accentuating its volume. Architects are increasingly using white as a tool for sculptural expression in building design. The color’s ability to highlight shadows and create depth perception makes it ideal for complex geometric forms. This characteristic has become particularly valuable in contemporary architecture, where buildings often serve as cultural landmarks. Notable examples include Santiago Calatrava’s works, where white surfaces emphasize the flowing, organic forms that have become his signature style.</p>, <p><noscript><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-535157\" data-jpibfi-post-excerpt=\"\" data-jpibfi-post-title=\"The Modern White Aesthetic Trend: 8 Designs That Showcase Why Architects Love This Classic Color\" data-jpibfi-post-url=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2025/02/15/the-modern-white-aesthetic-trend-8-designs-that-showcase-why-architects-love-this-clean-classic-color/\" data-jpibfi-src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2025/02/why-white-color-is-dominating-modern-building-design/White-Colour_Architecture_Buildings_Importance_17.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2025/02/why-white-color-is-dominating-modern-building-design/White-Colour_Architecture_Buildings_Importance_17.jpg\" width=\"1280\"/></noscript><img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload alignnone size-full wp-image-535157\" data-jpibfi-post-excerpt=\"\" data-jpibfi-post-title=\"The Modern White Aesthetic Trend: 8 Designs That Showcase Why Architects Love This Classic Color\" data-jpibfi-post-url=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2025/02/15/the-modern-white-aesthetic-trend-8-designs-that-showcase-why-architects-love-this-clean-classic-color/\" data-jpibfi-src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2025/02/why-white-color-is-dominating-modern-building-design/White-Colour_Architecture_Buildings_Importance_17.jpg\" data-src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2025/02/why-white-color-is-dominating-modern-building-design/White-Colour_Architecture_Buildings_Importance_17.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"960\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201280%20960%22%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"1280\"/></p>, <p><noscript><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-535155\" data-jpibfi-post-excerpt=\"\" data-jpibfi-post-title=\"The Modern White Aesthetic Trend: 8 Designs That Showcase Why Architects Love This Classic Color\" data-jpibfi-post-url=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2025/02/15/the-modern-white-aesthetic-trend-8-designs-that-showcase-why-architects-love-this-clean-classic-color/\" data-jpibfi-src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2025/02/why-white-color-is-dominating-modern-building-design/White-Colour_Architecture_Buildings_Importance_15.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2025/02/why-white-color-is-dominating-modern-building-design/White-Colour_Architecture_Buildings_Importance_15.jpg\" width=\"1280\"/></noscript><img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload alignnone size-full wp-image-535155\" data-jpibfi-post-excerpt=\"\" data-jpibfi-post-title=\"The Modern White Aesthetic Trend: 8 Designs That Showcase Why Architects Love This Classic Color\" data-jpibfi-post-url=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2025/02/15/the-modern-white-aesthetic-trend-8-designs-that-showcase-why-architects-love-this-clean-classic-color/\" data-jpibfi-src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2025/02/why-white-color-is-dominating-modern-building-design/White-Colour_Architecture_Buildings_Importance_15.jpg\" data-src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2025/02/why-white-color-is-dominating-modern-building-design/White-Colour_Architecture_Buildings_Importance_15.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"960\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201280%20960%22%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"1280\"/></p>, <p>Located by the Vejle Fjord in Denmark, <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2023/02/08/eye-catching-wave-shaped-building-adds-a-dynamic-form-to-this-danish-towns-skyline/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Wave</a> is an award-winning residential complex by Henning Larsen that challenges traditional high-rise design with its dynamic sawtooth-wave shape.

Reflections in the nearby Viznytsia River accentuate its striking design.</p>, <p>White creates high contrast with colors and textures, highlighting architectural details and providing striking contrasts against the blue sky and green landscape. The strategic use of white in contemporary architecture goes beyond aesthetic contrast. Architects are experimenting with textured white surfaces that change appearance throughout the day as light conditions shift. This dynamic quality creates buildings that seem to transform from morning to evening, adding a temporal dimension to architectural design. The approach is particularly effective in cultural institutions and public spaces, where the changing appearance becomes part of the visitor experience.</p>, <p><noscript><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-535142\" data-jpibfi-post-excerpt=\"\" data-jpibfi-post-title=\"The Modern White Aesthetic Trend: 8 Designs That Showcase Why Architects Love This Classic Color\" data-jpibfi-post-url=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2025/02/15/the-modern-white-aesthetic-trend-8-designs-that-showcase-why-architects-love-this-clean-classic-color/\" data-jpibfi-src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2025/02/why-white-color-is-dominating-modern-building-design/White-Colour_Architecture_Buildings_Importance_2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2025/02/why-white-color-is-dominating-modern-building-design/White-Colour_Architecture_Buildings_Importance_2.jpg\" width=\"1280\"/></noscript><img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload alignnone size-full wp-image-535142\" data-jpibfi-post-excerpt=\"\" data-jpibfi-post-title=\"The Modern White Aesthetic Trend: 8 Designs That Showcase Why Architects Love This Classic Color\" data-jpibfi-post-url=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2025/02/15/the-modern-white-aesthetic-trend-8-designs-that-showcase-why-architects-love-this-clean-classic-color/\" data-jpibfi-src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2025/02/why-white-color-is-dominating-modern-building-design/White-Colour_Architecture_Buildings_Importance_2.jpg\" data-src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2025/02/why-white-color-is-dominating-modern-building-design/White-Colour_Architecture_Buildings_Importance_2.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"960\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201280%20960%22%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"1280\"/></p>, <p><noscript><img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-535141\" data-jpibfi-post-excerpt=\"\" data-jpibfi-post-title=\"The Modern White Aesthetic Trend: 8 Designs That Showcase Why Architects Love This Classic Color\" data-jpibfi-post-url=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2025/02/15/the-modern-white-aesthetic-trend-8-designs-that-showcase-why-architects-love-this-clean-classic-color/\" data-jpibfi-src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2025/02/why-white-color-is-dominating-modern-building-design/White-Colour_Architecture_Buildings_Importance_1.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2025/02/why-white-color-is-dominating-modern-building-design/White-Colour_Architecture_Buildings_Importance_1.jpg\" width=\"1280\"/></noscript><img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload alignnone size-full wp-image-535141\" data-jpibfi-post-excerpt=\"\" data-jpibfi-post-title=\"The Modern White Aesthetic Trend: 8 Designs That Showcase Why Architects Love This Classic Color\" data-jpibfi-post-url=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2025/02/15/the-modern-white-aesthetic-trend-8-designs-that-showcase-why-architects-love-this-clean-classic-color/\" data-jpibfi-src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2025/02/why-white-color-is-dominating-modern-building-design/White-Colour_Architecture_Buildings_Importance_1.jpg\" data-src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2025/02/why-white-color-is-dominating-modern-building-design/White-Colour_Architecture_Buildings_Importance_1.jpg\" decoding=\"async\" height=\"960\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201280%20960%22%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"1280\"/></p>, <p>Architect Stefano Boeri’s <a href=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2024/07/04/this-technological-center-in-china-is-a-man-made-mountain-with-terraces-hanging-gardens/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Culture CBD Modern Technology Experience Center</a> in Xi’an, China, will feature a unique concrete facade, enhancing its resemblance to a tree-covered mountain.

      "Dark days ahead, folksâRobert F. Kennedy Jr. is taking charge of Americaâs public health. On Thursday morning, the U.S. Senate voted to approve President Donald Trumpâs nomination of RFK Jr. to head the Department of Health and Human Services. The Senate voted in favor of RFK Jr. by a tally of 52 to 48âwith Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell being the lone Republican vote against him. Other Republican senators who initially expressed their misgivings about RFK Jr. have said they were satisfied by his responses, which included a promise to safeguard vaccinations. But many medical and public health experts fear he and Trump will cause colossal damage to the country’s public health. How Trump’s Second Term Could Shape the Future of Health in America \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " RFK Jr.’s path to the chief of HHS has been twisty, to say the least. For many years, he was a well-lauded lawyer, environmental advocate, and Democrat, even initially running for president last election in the Democratic primary. But Kennedy also has a long history of making misleading or outright false statements about important health issues, particularly vaccination. His first major proclamation on the subject, the 2005 article “Deadly Immunity” published in both Rolling Stone and Salon, promoted a debunked link between mercury-based thimerosal in vaccines and autism. The article was so riddled with errors that Salon added five corrections to it within days, and by 2011, both publishers pulled the article entirely (though only Salon posted a retraction notice explaining why).\n",

      "\n",

      "[Kennedy] is joining an administration that appears set to deregulate polluters and strip healthcare from millionsâsteps we know will worsen health for those with chronic ailments. After failing to make headway in the 2024 Democratic presidential primary, RFK Jr. chose to run a third party presidential campaign. By August, however, he dropped out and endorsed Trump for president. In return, Trump pledged that Kennedy would be given free rein to reshape the countryâs public health agenda should he winâto “make America healthy again” in RFK Jr.’s words. Soon after his election win, Trump announced his nomination of Kennedy to head HHS. Kennedy has spread misinformation about vaccines since 2005, serving as the chairman of the well-known anti-vaccination group Childrenâs Health Defense from 2015 to 2023. In one especially egregious moment, he and Children’s Health Defense promoted the local anti-vaccination movement in Samoa during 2019, with Kennedy even making a visit to the country that June to support advocates and meet with government officials.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a tragic incident in Samoa the year before, in which two children had died from measles shots that nurses had mistakenly mixed with muscle relaxant instead of waterâa medical error that anti-vaccination advocates used to sow mistrust of the vaccine itself. Fueled by lowering vaccination rates, a massive measles outbreak struck Samoa in the fall of 2019, which led to the deaths of 83 residents, mostly children under five. Kennedy has since minimized any potential culpability he had in the Samoa outbreak. During the Senate committee hearings to vet his nomination, he even suggested that fewer children may have died from measles than reportedâa statement that Samoaâs current Director-General of Health Alec Ekeroma calledÂ a âtotal fabrication.â You Thought Anti-Vax Was Bad? These Are RFK Jr.’s Most Disturbing Beliefs About Health \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Vaccines aren’t the only thing that RFK Jr. has made misleading statements about. In his 2021 book, The Real Anthony Fauci, KennedyÂ questioned whether AIDS was caused by HIVÂ (it is), and has previously suggested that a âgay lifestyle,â particularly the use of recreational drugs such as poppers among the gay community, was the actual cause of AIDS. He’s suggested that water fluoridation is causing cancer (while there is a real ongoing scientific debate about the pros and cons of fluoridation, studies overall have not supported a cancer link). And he’s also supported the conspiratorial belief in chemtrailsâthe idea that planes are deliberately releasing hazardous chemicals into the atmosphere (in actuality, the trails these planes leave behind are mostly water vapor). In a post on X last summer, RFKÂ indicatedÂ he would stop the âcrimeâ of chemtrails if given the opportunity. In the lead-up to the Senate vote, some Republican lawmakers did express hesitance about RFK Jr.’s fitness for the position, particularly given his past stances on vaccination. Louisiana senator Bill Cassidy, a former physician, stated that he changed his mind after being promised that the Trump administration and RFK Jr. would work closely with the Senate health committee to protect “the public health benefit of vaccination.” He also stated that Kennedy “has been insistent that he just wants good science and to ensure safety.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Other senators have argued that RFK Jr.’s positions on addressing the drivers of chronic illness make him well-suited to lead HHS. In explaining his yes vote to advance Kennedy’s nomination last week, Senator Thom Tillis argued that RFK Jr. would positively change the status quo of Americaâs health care system. But there’s little to suggest that Kennedy’s approach to public health will mark any kind of advancement, according to Adam Gaffney, a critical care and pulmonary physician as well as a former president of Physicians for a National Health Program. “RFK Jr. is unlikely to have any useful impact on chronic diseases because, on the one hand, he holds an array of pseudoscientific beliefs about chronic disease, and on the other, he is joining an administration that appears set to deregulate polluters and strip healthcare from millionsâsteps we know will worsen health for those with chronic ailments,” Gaffney told Gizmodo. “People don’t realize that his anti-vaccine beliefs are foundational to his distorted understanding of chronic disease: he believes that vaccines are a key driver of conditions such as autism. And while no one can disagree with his general support for improving childhood nutrition, he offers few concrete proposals that would make a differenceâlike universal free high-quality school lunches.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Even when he highlights real issuesâlike the prevalence of unhealthy, processed dietsâhe often blames the wrong targets. He’s regularly singled out food ingredients like seed oils, or refined plant-based vegetable oils, as a major reason why weâre less healthy compared to other countries, for instance. But studies in general haven’t found a link between seed oil consumption and worsened health, while some research has even suggested that replacing certain sources of saturated fats with seed oils can improve cardiovascular outcomes. Processed foods tend to be less healthy, but mainly because they contain high levels ofÂ sugar, salt, and fat. As the presumptive director of HHS (he still needs to be sworn inâa formality), Kennedy will be able to sway the priorities of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, and the National Institutes of Health, to name a few. But nothing about RFK Jr’s, Trump’s, or the GOP’s track records indicate that they will actually focus on the most important health issues facing Americans today. Even if he does leave vaccines mostly alone, for example, Kennedy has already promised to suspend government funding into vital initiatives like infectious disease research, just five years after the emergence of the covid-19 pandemic. “The reality is that the Trump administration is almost certainly going to coddle, not confront, powerful corporate interests like the food industry. Meanwhile, on the campaign trail, Trump promised to repeal Biden-era power plant rules that will put more pollution in the air. Less MAHA, more ‘Make America Wheeze Again’,” Gaffney said. “Finally, Medicaid cuts currently being considered by Congressional Republicans could take healthcare from millionsâand that would both cause and exacerbate chronic disease. For instance, lack of healthcare causes people with high blood pressure to go without careâand suffer chronic complications like heart disease and stroke as a consequence.” To put it bluntly, neither the U.S. nor the world is likely to benefit from Trump and RFK Jr. leading the nation’s public health agencies.\n",

      "[<p>Dark days ahead, folksâRobert F. Kennedy Jr. is taking charge of Americaâs public health. On Thursday morning, the U.S. Senate voted to approve President Donald Trumpâs nomination of RFK Jr. to head the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>, <p>The Senate voted in favor of RFK Jr. by a tally of 52 to 48âwith Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell being the lone Republican vote against him. Other Republican senators who initially expressed their misgivings about RFK Jr. have said they were satisfied by his responses, which included a promise to safeguard vaccinations. But many medical and public health experts fear he and Trump will cause colossal damage to the country’s public health.</p>, <p><a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/how-trumps-second-term-could-shape-the-future-of-health-in-america-2000528082\">How Trump’s Second Term Could Shape the Future of Health in America</a></p>, <p>RFK Jr.’s path to the chief of HHS has been twisty, to say the least. For many years, he was a well-lauded lawyer, <a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/22092024/robert-f-kennedy-jr-environmental-hero-to-outcast/\">environmental advocate</a>, and Democrat, even initially running for president last election in the Democratic primary. But Kennedy also has a long history of making misleading or outright false statements about important health issues, particularly vaccination.</p>, <p>His first major proclamation on the subject, the 2005 article “Deadly Immunity” published in both <em>Rolling Stone</em> and <em>Salon</em>, promoted a debunked link between mercury-based thimerosal in vaccines and autism. The article was so riddled with errors that <em>Salon</em> added <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2011/01/16/dangerous_immunity/#:~:text=Editor%20in%20Chief-,Corrections%3A%C2%A0%C2%A0,-The%20story%C2%A0%22Deadly\">five corrections</a> to it within days, and by 2011, both publishers pulled the article entirely (though only <em>Salon</em> posted a <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2011/01/16/dangerous_immunity/\">retraction notice</a> explaining why).</p>, <p>After failing to make headway in the 2024 Democratic presidential primary, RFK Jr. chose to run a third party presidential campaign. By August, however, he dropped out and endorsed Trump for president. In return, Trump <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/trump-teases-vaccine-bans-with-rfk-jr-in-potential-health-role-2000520096\">pledged</a> that Kennedy would be given free rein to reshape the countryâs public health agenda should he winâto “make America healthy again” in RFK Jr.’s words. Soon after his election win, Trump announced his nomination of Kennedy to head HHS.</p>, <p>Kennedy has spread misinformation about vaccines since 2005, serving as the chairman of the well-known anti-vaccination group <a href=\"https://centerforinquiry.org/blog/covert-anti-vaccination-in-childrens-health-defense/\">Childrenâs Health Defense</a> from 2015 to 2023. In one especially egregious moment, he and Children’s Health Defense promoted the <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/07/how-rfk-jr-falsely-denied-his-connection-to-a-deadly-measles-outbreak-in-samoa/\">local anti-vaccination movement</a> in Samoa during 2019, with Kennedy even making a visit to the country that June to support advocates and meet with government officials.</p>, <p>There was a tragic incident in Samoa the year before, in which two children had died from measles shots that nurses had mistakenly mixed with muscle relaxant instead of waterâa medical error that anti-vaccination advocates used to sow mistrust of the vaccine itself. Fueled by lowering vaccination rates, a massive measles outbreak struck Samoa in the fall of 2019, which led to the deaths of 83 residents, mostly children under five.</p>, <p>Kennedy has since <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/rfk-jr-claims-had-nothing-204540788.html\">minimized</a> any potential culpability he had in the Samoa outbreak. During the Senate committee hearings to vet his nomination, he even suggested that fewer children may have died from measles than reportedâa statement that Samoaâs current Director-General of Health Alec Ekeroma <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/rfk-jr-samoa-measles-kennedy-vaccines-pacific-42a9cb583c71f165699b16710884c474\">called</a>Â a âtotal fabrication.â</p>, <p><a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/you-thought-anti-vax-was-bad-these-are-rfk-jr-s-most-disturbing-beliefs-about-health-2000524995\">You Thought Anti-Vax Was Bad? These Are RFK Jr.’s Most Disturbing Beliefs About Health</a></p>, <p>Vaccines aren’t the only thing that RFK Jr. has made misleading statements about. In his 2021 book, <em>The Real Anthony Fauci</em>, KennedyÂ <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10461-024-04528-3#:~:text=HIV%20denial%20has,interviews%20and%20panels.\">questioned whether AIDS was caused by HIV</a>Â (it is), and has previously suggested that a â<a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/politics/robert-f-kennedy-jr-poppers\">gay lifestyle</a>,â particularly the use of recreational drugs such as poppers among the gay community, was the actual cause of AIDS. He’s suggested that water fluoridation is causing cancer (while there is a real ongoing <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/what-does-the-evidence-say-about-fluoride-lowering-iq-2000548298\">scientific debate</a> about the pros and cons of fluoridation, studies overall have <a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/chemicals/water-fluoridation-and-cancer-risk.html\">not supported</a> a cancer link). And he’s also supported the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-62240071\">conspiratorial belief</a> in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/27/thread-connecting-robert-kennedy-jr-chemtrails-project-2025/\">chemtrails</a>âthe idea that planes are deliberately releasing hazardous chemicals into the atmosphere (in actuality, the trails these planes leave behind are mostly water vapor). In a post on X last summer, RFKÂ <a href=\"https://x.com/Shayan86/status/1828264438559838443\">indicated</a>Â he would stop the âcrimeâ of chemtrails if given the opportunity.</p>, <p>In the lead-up to the Senate vote, some Republican lawmakers did express hesitance about RFK Jr.’s fitness for the position, particularly given his past stances on vaccination. Louisiana senator Bill Cassidy, a former physician, stated that he changed his mind after being promised that the Trump administration and RFK Jr. would work closely with the Senate health committee to <a href=\"https://www.cassidy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cassidy-delivers-floor-speech-in-support-of-rfk-jr-to-be-hhs-secretary/#:~:text=the%20public%20health%20benefit%20of%20vaccination.\">protect</a> “the public health benefit of vaccination.” He also stated that Kennedy “has been insistent that he just wants good science and to ensure safety.”</p>, <p>Other senators have argued that RFK Jr.’s positions on addressing the drivers of chronic illness make him well-suited to lead HHS. In explaining his yes vote to <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-wins-crucial-senate-vote-to-lead-americas-health-system-2000558959\">advance Kennedy’s nomination</a> last week, Senator Thom Tillis argued that RFK Jr. would positively change the status quo of Americaâs health care system.</p>, <p>But there’s little to suggest that Kennedy’s approach to public health will mark any kind of advancement, according to Adam Gaffney, a critical care and pulmonary physician as well as a former president of Physicians for a National Health Program.</p>, <p>“RFK Jr. is unlikely to have any useful impact on chronic diseases because, on the one hand, he holds an array of pseudoscientific beliefs about chronic disease, and on the other, he is joining an administration that appears set to deregulate polluters and strip healthcare from millionsâsteps we know will worsen health for those with chronic ailments,” Gaffney told Gizmodo. “People don’t realize that his anti-vaccine beliefs are foundational to his distorted understanding of chronic disease: he believes that vaccines are a key driver of conditions such as autism. And while no one can disagree with his general support for improving childhood nutrition, he offers few concrete proposals that would make a differenceâlike universal free high-quality school lunches.”</p>, <p>Even when he highlights real issuesâlike the prevalence of unhealthy, processed dietsâhe often blames the wrong targets. He’s regularly <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/reel/1055342039467967/\">singled out food ingredients like seed oils</a>, or refined plant-based vegetable oils, as a major reason why weâre less healthy compared to other countries, for instance. But studies in general haven’t found a link between <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-eating/do-seed-oils-make-you-sick-a1363483895/\">seed oil consumption and worsened health</a>, while some research has <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/what-are-seed-oils-and-why-do-rfk-jr-and-others-claim-theyre-bad-for-you/#:~:text=Clinical%20trials%20have,at%20Tufts%20University.\">even suggested</a> that replacing certain sources of saturated fats with seed oils can improve cardiovascular outcomes. Processed foods tend to be less healthy, but mainly because they contain high levels ofÂ <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/ultra-processed-foods/\">sugar, salt, and fat</a>.</p>, <p>As the presumptive director of HHS (he still needs to be sworn inâa formality), Kennedy will be able to sway the priorities of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, and the National Institutes of Health, to name a few. But nothing about RFK Jr’s, Trump’s, or the GOP’s track records indicate that they will actually focus on the most important health issues facing Americans today. Even if he does leave vaccines mostly alone, for example, Kennedy has <a href=\"https://boingboing.net/2024/11/15/trump-pick-rfk-jr-promises-to-end-infectious-disease-research-on-week-one-video.html\">already promised</a> to suspend government funding into vital initiatives like infectious disease research, just five years after the emergence of the covid-19 pandemic.</p>, <p>“The reality is that the Trump administration is almost certainly going to coddle, not confront, powerful corporate interests like the food industry. Meanwhile, on the campaign trail, Trump <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-would-axe-biden-clean-power-rules-speed-power-plant-approvals-campaign-2024-08-29/\">promised to repeal</a> Biden-era power plant rules that will put more pollution in the air. Less MAHA, more ‘Make America Wheeze Again’,” Gaffney said. “Finally, Medicaid cuts currently being considered by Congressional Republicans could take healthcare from millionsâand that would both cause and exacerbate chronic disease. For instance, lack of healthcare causes people with high blood pressure to go without careâand suffer chronic complications like heart disease and stroke as a consequence.”</p>, <p>To put it bluntly, neither the U.S. nor the world is likely to benefit from Trump and RFK Jr. leading the nation’s public health agencies.</p>, <p class=\"post-tags\">\n",

Listen to more stories on the Noa app.In Wisconsin, where late last year Donald Trump said at a campaign stop, “I’m an environmentalist … I want clean air and clean water—really clean water,” many people want that too. Like Americans across the country, many Wisconsinites have in recent years come to understand that they have been drinking water contaminated by highly toxic “forever chemicals,” compounds known as PFAS, for decades. This is a challenge for Trump the environmentalist, whose administration is widely expected to gut many environmental regulations and has already suspended work that would have put limits on PFAS. Yet Lee Zeldin, now the EPA’s administrator, said in his confirmation hearing last month that PFAS would be a “top priority” for the agency, and as a member of Congress, he sided with Democrats to back rules that would limit the chemicals in drinking water and make polluters pay for cleanup.PFAS are the rare environmental issue that might evoke the bipartisan zeitgeist in which Congress passed the Clean Water Act in 1972. By then, President Richard Nixon had already overseen the creation of the EPA but vetoed the landmark water bill, which he thought was too expensive. But 17 Republicans joined with Democrats to override his veto. “If we cannot swim in our lakes and rivers, if we cannot breathe the air God has given us, what other comforts can life offer us?” Senator Howard Baker, a Republican of Tennessee, said on the October morning of the vote.In this century, some Republicans have argued that PFAS measures are costly and come with legal burdens for businesses; the chemical industry has lobbied heavily against regulation in the U.S. and abroad. But like the environmental disasters of the 1970s, this one is alarming enough that politicians who might otherwise oppose regulation want the government to do something about it.In his first term, Trump’s EPA issued a PFAS Action Plan to designate the compounds as hazardous, set limits, and make cleanup recommendations. But the White House also opposed a PFAS bill in Congress after the chemical industry objected to it, and the closest the administration came to fulfilling its own plans was submitting a proposal to regulate PFAS in drinking water on its very last day. In the next four years, PFAS could test whether Trump’s version of the EPA—stripped of many career employees and staffed with industry lobbyists—can do the job millions of Americans may want it to.PFAS, as I’ve written before, are the DDT of this era, though perhaps it is more accurate to say they’re worse: Where DDT was a single compound with a single use, PFAS is an umbrella term for thousands of compounds used in a plethora of quotidian ways. They are often the reason “performance” fabrics on couches can resist stains, a rice cooker wipes clean so easily, and boots are waterproof. They make paper plates grease-resistant and conditioner extra silky. In the places where they are manufactured or are used to manufacture other things, decades of effluent have contaminated groundwater and fed into municipal water supplies. No one has figured out how to destroy the compounds, whose fluorine-carbon bond is the single most stable in organic chemistry, at scale.And so they persist, virtually forever, cycling through the water system and accumulating in our bodies. PFAS weren’t a known concern when the Clean Water Act was created, nor were they on anyone’s radar when the Safe Drinking Water Act came into force in 1974. By the ’70s, however, 3M knew that a PFAS compound it had invented, and sold to DuPont to make Teflon, was accumulating in employees’ blood.Now nearly every American has PFAS in theirs. Over the past half century, these compounds have been used in dozens of industries to manufacture thousands of products globally, creating a noxious waste stream that has infiltrated countless communities. Studies have linked exposure to PFAS with kidney cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease, decreased fertility, and developmental problems in children, among other issues.Last year, some two decades after the EPA began investigating these compounds, the Biden administration ordered water utilities to test for several kinds of PFAS in their water, and then begin all but eliminating those compounds, for the first time. The agency says that, much like for lead, there is no safe level of two of the most common of these compounds. It also released a report warning of the dangers of spreading sewage sludge—often highly contaminated by PFAS—on fields as fertilizer, a practice that continues in many states. And it was about to set the first discharge limits for PFAS in industrial wastewater—a rule the Trump administration has now put on pause. (An EPA spokesperson told me this action was part of “common transition procedures.”) This means municipal water systems will have to test for PFAS, but manufacturers will not need to measure or limit PFAS in the wastewater they release to those systems.In the meantime, American towns and cities are trying to deal with PFAS’s threat piecemeal. In Campbell, Wisconsin, a town on a riverine island where people watch bald eagles hunt for fish, and raise their kids in the houses where they were raised, water samples from residents’ wells first came back positive for PFAS in 2020. Firefighting foam, made of PFAS, was used to put out plane-crash fires and to train firefighters at a nearby airport for decades. Residents now wonder if that explains the many unusual diagnoses among their neighbors, Lee Donahue, a Campbell town supervisor, told me: testicular cancer in a 20-year-old, or an ovarian cancer that usually strikes later in life in a woman in her 30s.Nearly five years after those water tests, residents are still drinking bottled water while the town board works to reroute the drinking-water supply away from contaminated wells and toward a new source. That switch is partly funded by grants from President Joe Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which Trump has put on pause, and partly by EPA grants secured by Senator Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, and the town’s representative, Derrick Van Orden, a Republican. “This isn’t the most popular Republican position, I don’t really care,” Van Orden told the local ABC affiliate at the time the grant was announced. “When you turn on your faucet, it doesn’t ask if you’re a Republican or a Democrat.”Campbell is a microcosm of a swing state: It split its vote almost exactly 50–50 between Trump and Kamala Harris, Donahue, who is also a town election worker, told me. On the other side of the state, Marinette, a city of 11,000, is an “extremely red community” that is dealing with its own PFAS problems, Cindy Boyle, a former town-board chairperson, told me. At 53, Boyle realizes she may have been drinking water tainted with PFAS her whole life: Tyco Fire Products tested its firefighting foam on land a half mile from the house where she raised her three sons, and its effluent was spread as sludge on fields within a mile of the house she grew up in, she said. The company was sued by the state, public water systems, and some residents in the area. Boyle was not one of them; still, the company is now providing a whole-house filter at her home, and distributing bottled water. (Tyco settled the suits with the water systems and residents without admitting wrongdoing; the state’s suit is on pause.)But damage may have already been done. She had her thyroid removed in her 30s; her sister has thyroid disease now, and her mother had kidney cancer. Her husband has Parkinson’s disease; recent research shows that PFAS can accumulate in the brain and links them to neurological disorders. Boyle is a registered independent from a conservative family, and she’d “take a Bush any day now,” she told me. But she says she can’t vote for anyone who isn’t interested in clamping down on PFAS.In Wisconsin, Democrats and Republicans are currently locked in a battle at the statehouse over how to do that. Republicans have been holding up a proposed fund for testing and remediation out of fears it could force landowners to pay for cleanups of pollution they didn’t cause; on Tuesday Governor Tony Evers, a Democrat, announced a state budget meant to resolve their concerns and release the funds—if the legislature passes it.In the absence of federal regulation, states’ efforts to address PFAS have been patchwork and politically unpredictable. In West Virginia, which voted for Trump by a ratio of 7 to 3 and is arguably the birthplace of the PFAS crisis in the U.S., former Governor Jim Justice, a Republican, passed legislation to curb it. In North Carolina, where an estimated 2.5 million residents have PFAS in their tap water, Republican appointees to a state commission have stalled rule making that would set clear limits on PFAS’s presence there. Maine, which has a Democrat-controlled legislature and a widespread PFAS crisis, has passed some of the most stringent PFAS bills in the nation. New York was among the first states to declare certain PFAS hazardous substances, but it also plans to double the volume of sludge it spreads on fields by 2050.Tackling PFAS contamination meaningfully will require federal effort. During Trump’s previous term, he appointed a former chemical-industry executive to oversee toxic chemicals at the EPA, where she rewrote rules, making it harder to track their health impacts. Back then, Americans in some states were just beginning to understand the threats PFAS posed. Now, eight years later, the landscape is very different—and states are watching. In his time as a congressional representative from New York, Zeldin was in favor of getting rid of PFAS contamination, going so far as to urge the EPA to move faster to regulate it. At his confirmation hearing, he gave no details of how he would proceed on PFAS as EPA administrator, and when I asked the EPA for more specifics, a spokesperson pointed me to the action plan from the first term. Whatever steps Zeldin does take will show what making an issue a priority looks like for Trump’s EPA in this term, and define how far this administration’s environmentalism actually goes.About the AuthorZoë SchlangerFollowZoë Schlanger is a staff writer at The Atlantic.

PFAS weren’t a known concern when the Clean Water Act was created, nor were they on anyone’s radar when the Safe Drinking Water Act came into force in 1974. By the ’70s, however, 3M <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/07/31/3m-pfas-minnesota-pfoa-pfos/\">knew</a> that a PFAS compound it had invented, and sold to DuPont to make Teflon, was accumulating in employees’ blood.</p>, <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"></p>, <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Now nearly every American <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/data-research/facts-stats/index.html\">has PFAS in theirs</a>. Over the past half century, these compounds have been used in dozens of industries to manufacture thousands of products globally, creating a noxious waste stream that has infiltrated countless communities. Studies have linked exposure to PFAS with kidney cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease, decreased fertility, and developmental problems in children, among other issues.</p>, <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"></p>, <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Last year, some two decades after the EPA began investigating these compounds, the Biden administration ordered water utilities to test for several kinds of PFAS in their water, and then begin all but eliminating those compounds, for the first time. The agency says that, much like for lead, there is <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-first-ever-national-drinking-water-standard\">no safe level</a> of two of the most common of these compounds. It also released a report <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/14/climate/epa-pfas-forever-chemicals-sludge-fertilizer.html\">warning</a> of the dangers of spreading sewage sludge—often highly contaminated by PFAS—on fields as fertilizer, a practice that continues in many states. And it was about to set the first discharge limits for PFAS in industrial wastewater—a rule the Trump administration has now put on pause. (An EPA spokesperson told me this action was part of “common transition procedures.”) This means municipal water systems will have to test for PFAS, but manufacturers will not need to measure or limit PFAS in the wastewater they release to those systems.</p>, <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"></p>, <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">In the meantime, American towns and cities are trying to deal with PFAS’s threat piecemeal. In Campbell, Wisconsin, a town on a riverine island where people watch bald eagles hunt for fish, and raise their kids in the houses where they were raised, water samples from residents’ wells first came back positive for PFAS in 2020. Firefighting foam, made of PFAS, was used to put out plane-crash fires and to train firefighters at a nearby airport for decades. Residents now wonder if that explains the many unusual diagnoses among their neighbors, Lee Donahue, a Campbell town supervisor, told me: testicular cancer in a 20-year-old, or an ovarian cancer that usually strikes later in life in a woman in her 30s.</p>, <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"></p>, <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Nearly five years after those water tests, residents are still drinking bottled water while the town board works to reroute the drinking-water supply away from contaminated wells and toward a new source. That switch is partly funded by grants from President Joe Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which Trump has put on pause, and partly by EPA grants secured by Senator Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, and the town’s representative, Derrick Van Orden, a Republican. “This isn’t the most popular Republican position, I don’t really care,” Van Orden <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.wxow.com/news/town-of-campbell-getting-2-million-toward-pfas/article_9848b89a-ec94-11ee-a330-670b5e5c1a54.html\">told the local ABC affiliate</a> at the time the grant was announced. “When you turn on your faucet, it doesn’t ask if you’re a Republican or a Democrat.”</p>, <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"></p>, <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Campbell is a microcosm of a swing state: It split its vote almost exactly 50–50 between Trump and Kamala Harris, Donahue, who is also a town election worker, told me. On the other side of the state, Marinette, a city of 11,000, is an “extremely red community” that is dealing with its own PFAS problems, Cindy Boyle, a former town-board chairperson, told me. At 53, Boyle realizes she may have been drinking water tainted with PFAS her whole life: Tyco Fire Products tested its firefighting foam on land a half mile from the house where she raised her three sons, and its effluent was <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2023/04/12/wisconsin-labels-tyco-non-compliant-in-marinette-pfas-investigation/70101024007/\">spread as sludge</a> on fields within a mile of the house she grew up in, she said. The company was <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.wpr.org/environment/state-wisconsin-suing-johnson-controls-tyco-over-pfas-contamination-marinette\">sued by the state</a>, <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.ehextra.com/news/articles/tyco-settles-750-million-pfas-lawsuit/article_5b64e386-ffe5-11ee-a415-af27e2af8e7e.html\">public water systems</a>, and <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://tycomarinette.com/tyco-reaches-settlement-in-class-action-lawsuit-involving-fire-technology-center/\">some residents</a> in the area. Boyle was not one of them; still, the company is now providing a whole-house filter at her home, and distributing bottled water. (Tyco settled the suits with the water systems and residents without admitting wrongdoing; the state’s suit is on pause.)</p>, <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"></p>, <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">But damage may have already been done. She had her thyroid removed in her 30s; her sister has thyroid disease now, and her mother had kidney cancer. Her husband has Parkinson’s disease; recent research shows that PFAS can accumulate in the brain and <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35921496/\">links</a> them to neurological disorders. Boyle is a registered independent from a conservative family, and she’d “take a Bush any day now,” she told me. But she says she can’t vote for anyone who isn’t interested in clamping down on PFAS.</p>, <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"></p>, <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">In Wisconsin, Democrats and Republicans are currently <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2024/05/21/pfas-bill-was-born-in-the-hope-of-compromise-then-both-sides-dug-in-and-it-died/\">locked in a battle</a> at the statehouse over how to do that. Republicans have been holding up a proposed fund for testing and remediation out of fears it could force landowners to pay for cleanups of pollution they didn’t cause; on Tuesday Governor Tony Evers, a Democrat, <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://spectrumnews1.com/wi/milwaukee/news/2025/02/04/gov--evers-budgets-for-pfas-mitigation\">announced</a> a state budget meant to resolve their concerns and release the funds—if the legislature passes it.</p>, <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"></p>, <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">In the absence of federal regulation, states’ efforts to address PFAS have been patchwork and politically unpredictable. In West Virginia, which voted for Trump by a ratio of 7 to 3 and is arguably the <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2015/08/11/dupont-chemistry-deception/\">birthplace</a> of the PFAS crisis in the U.S., former Governor Jim Justice, a Republican, <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://natlawreview.com/article/west-virginia-passes-pfas-protection-act\">passed legislation</a> to curb it. In North Carolina, where an estimated <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.ewg.org/research/state-forever-chemicals-spotlight-north-carolinas-drinking-water-contamination\">2.5 million residents</a> have PFAS in their tap water, Republican appointees to a state commission have <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article288344715.html\">stalled</a> rule making that would set clear limits on PFAS’s presence there. Maine, which has a Democrat-controlled legislature and <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2024/04/pfas-drinking-water-maine/678040/\">a widespread PFAS crisis</a>, has passed some of the most stringent PFAS bills in the nation. New York was among the <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://dec.ny.gov/environmental-protection/site-cleanup/pfas\">first states</a> to declare certain PFAS hazardous substances, but it also <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://ambrook.com/research/environment/sludge-biosolids-farmland-New-York-PFAS\">plans</a> to <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nys/central-ny/news/2025/01/24/epa-dec-new-york-state-biosolids-sewage-spread-pfas\">double</a> the volume of sludge it spreads on fields by 2050.</p>, <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"></p>, <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\">Tackling PFAS contamination meaningfully will require federal effort. During Trump’s previous term, he appointed a former chemical-industry executive to oversee toxic chemicals at the EPA, where she <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/21/us/trump-epa-chemicals-regulations.html\">rewrote rules</a>, making it harder to track their health impacts. Back then, Americans in some states were just beginning to understand the threats PFAS posed. Now, eight years later, the landscape is very different—and states are watching. In his time as a congressional representative from New York, Zeldin was in favor of getting rid of PFAS contamination, going so far as to <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://www.longislandpress.com/2019/06/20/letter-water-contamination-on-long-island-14/\">urge the EPA</a> to move faster to regulate it. At his confirmation hearing, he gave no details of how he would proceed on PFAS as EPA administrator, and when I asked the EPA for more specifics, a spokesperson pointed me to the <a data-event-element=\"inline link\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200101165930/https:/www.epa.gov/pfas/epas-pfas-action-plan\">action plan</a> from the first term. Whatever steps Zeldin does take will show what making an issue a priority looks like for Trump’s EPA in this term, and define how far this administration’s environmentalism actually goes.</p>, <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"></p>, <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"></p>, <p class=\"ArticleParagraph_root__4mszW\" data-flatplan-paragraph=\"true\"></p>, <p class=\"ArticleBio_contentHeading__cmbmT\">More Stories</p>, <p>The End of L.A.’s Magical Thinking</p>, <p>What Happens When a Plastic City Burns</p>]\n",

It made about $1.087 billion from its actions. AdvertisementRelated ContentToyota is the world's best-selling automaker — againToyota says going all-in on electric cars will cost jobsRelated ContentToyota is the world's best-selling automaker — againToyota says going all-in on electric cars will cost jobsThe misconduct first came to light in March 2022, when employees were revealed to have tampered with test results on engines used in more than 643,000 vehicles, including tens of thousands subject to a recall. Toyota removed Hino from a major Japanese truck consortium, and four officials, including three executives overseeing production and compliance, resigned. AdvertisementA committee commissioned to investigate the scandal blamed it on an environment in which workers were forced to meet a strict pace of work and engineers felt they couldn’t challenge their bosses. A poor work environment was also found at Toyota’s Daihatsu subsidiary as part of an investigation into its recent safety scandal that tormented the Japanese auto industry last year. Advertisement“Hino’s actions led to vast amounts of excess air pollution and were an egregious violation of our nation’s environmental, consumer protection and import laws,” Assistant Attorney General Todd Kim said in a statement. As part of its agreement to resolve multiple civil and criminal allegations, Hino agreed to plead guilty to engaging in a multi-year conspiracy and serve a five-year probation, during which it will be prevented from importing diesel engines into the U.S. The deal is awaiting approval by a federal judge in Michigan. AdvertisementHino ran afoul of several federal agencies,  including the Environmental Protection Agency, the FBI, and the Department of Transportation, along with the state of California. The settlement includes a criminal penalty of $521.76 million, $442.5 million in civil penalties, and $236.5 million to resolve claims brought by California. In October, Hino booked a loss $230 billion yen, or about $1.54 billion, to cover the expected costs. Advertisement“This resolution is a significant milestone toward resolving legacy issues that we have worked hard to ensure are no longer a part of Hino’s operations or culture,” Hino CEO Satoshi Ogiso said in a statement, adding that the automaker has enacted several company-wide reforms to prevent future misconduct.“We commit to moving forward as a company that can be of service to society,” Ogiso said.📬 Sign up for the Daily BriefOur free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.\n",

      "In keeping with the promises he made while on the campaign trail, President Donald Trump has begun the process of shrinking the Environmental Protection Agency. It started on January 28, about a week after he was sworn in for his second term. That day, around 2 million employees across the federal government received an email saying they could either accept a “deal” to resign and receive eight months of pay or remain in their jobs and risk being laid off soon. \n",
      "A few days later, on February 1, over 1,100 EPA workers, all of whom are still in the trial period of their positions, received a second email informing them that the administration has the right to immediately terminate them. While some of these employees are in their first year at the EPA, others had recently switched into new roles after spending decades in the agency.  \n",

      "Zeldin has said he is committed to protecting Americans’ clean air and water. But, as Margot Brown, the senior vice president of environmental justice and equity at the Environmental Defense Fund told Grist, he has offered no plan towards achieving that goal. “It is the height of irresponsibility. It is the height of inefficiency,” Brown said, referring to the Trump administration’s actions so far. \n",
      "Steve Gilrein, who spent 40 years working in the air division of the EPA’s regional office in Dallas, before retiring in 2022, echoed Brown’s concerns and chalked the agency’s moves up to a public relations stunt. “It’s for a splash and I think it’s the wrong way to do it,” he told Grist. “I’m not saying the government can’t be more efficient. But I wish there was a plan that focused on keeping a healthy EPA that provides the services it’s meant to provide.”\n",
      "Amid a storm of rhetoric about a bloated federal government, the events of the past two weeks raise questions about whether the EPA, an agency long plagued by budget and staff shortages, can continue to fulfill its legal obligations with a contracted workforce. Even before “efficiency” became the highest priority for federal agencies, the number of workers employed by the EPA had been declining for decades. “We’ve been steadily shrinking,” Gilrein said. “They just didn’t tell people.”\n",

      "In the years after its founding in 1970, the EPA had only a few thousand staff members. Then, as the number of laws and programs under its purview grew — the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act — so did its workforce. The 1990s are often thought of as the agency’s golden years. During that decade, the workforce reached around 18,000 employees — a staffing apex that produced a flurry of new regulations for protecting the public from chemical dumping, tailpipe pollution, and petrochemical plant emissions.  \n",

      "\n",
      "Staff numbers then began a long decline. The EPA shrank the most dramatically during President Barack Obama’s administration, then further during Trump’s first term. Federalism, Gilrein explained, was the reason for the trend that has continued until this moment. Federal programs to ensure compliance with laws like the Clean Air Act were increasingly outsourced to the states to run. But, for agencies like the EPA, federalism must have a balance point; there are certain things that states can’t — or shouldn’t — do on their own. \n",
      "During Trump’s first year and a half in office, approximately 1,600 workers, or 18 percent of the EPA workforce, left. The exodus caused widespread “brain drain” that continues to afflict some agency programs to this day. Nonetheless, Brown, who worked at the time in the agency’s Office of Children’s Health Protection, recalled that there continued to be some level of cooperation between Trump’s first term appointees and EPA staff. Structural changes handicapped certain offices, and the budget limped along, but many staff members were able to keep their heads low and do their jobs.\n",
      "“There was an unbelievable amount of oversight because there was immense mistrust in the staff, but it was nothing like today,” Brown said.\n",
      "President Biden’s four years in office amounted to a momentary aberration. Biden and his EPA administrator Michael Regan added hundreds of new staff members, advanced the federal climate policy objectives, and strengthened enforcement against companies in industrial corridors like Louisiana’s “Cancer Alley.” For as much promise as Biden and Regan brought, their approach angered conservative state politicians known to favor the oil and gas industry, resulted in a spate of lawsuits against the EPA, and set the stage for Trump’s second term.\n",
      "Trump’s renewed mission to crush the agency promotes a severely limited type of federalism in which states have full power to administer the nation’s environmental laws as they please, with minimal oversight from the federal government. The problem with that approach, Gilrein said, is that it overlooks state environment agencies’ reliance on the EPA to fulfill practically every aspect of their mandates. \n",
      "During his four decades in the Region 6 office, Gilrein said that federal staffers worked “hand in hand” with the states, offering everything from technical guidance on regulatory decisions to millions of dollars in federal grant money. Agency staffers, many of whom have advanced degrees in fields like chemical engineering and toxicology, simply have expertise that states cannot afford with their limited budgets, Gilrein said. He recalled that under Obama and the first Trump administration, the regional office maintained positive relationships with the states in its jurisdiction, often helping them review permits and plan inspections. \n",
      "“We wanted our states to be as strong as they could be,” he said. \n",
      "One current staff member in the air division told Grist that few colleagues he knew were even considering taking the “deal,” believing that it was legally dubious and a bullying tactic to spur mass resignations. Furthermore, he continued, it was insulting to the American public that he should be able to collect a government salary while doing nothing for eight months. \n",
      "Trump and his appointees are explaining their early actions against the EPA as measures to spur economic growth. But current and former staff told Grist that the importance of the EPA will come into sharper focus when it is no longer able to fulfill the duties that staff have long dedicated themselves to.  \n",
      "For instance, the Office of Environmental Justice, which Trump recently announced would be closing, is responsible for administering billions of dollars in funds to communities on the front lines of the climate crisis. Under the previous Trump administration, the office had about 30 staff members; today, that number is over 160. If the plan to dismantle the office is seen through, Brown warned, “it will be impossible for those funds to be managed appropriately.” \n",
      "Gilrein wondered aloud if Trump had been able to get away with a lot of his rhetoric about the agency because the services it provides have long been invisible to the public. \n",
      "“Why are you celebrating the dismantling of an agency that’s proven critical to human health and the environment?” Gilrein asked. “You take for granted that you can drink the water out of your faucet. You can do that because of the EPA.”\n",

It started on January 28, about a week after he was sworn in for his second term. That day, around 2 million employees across the federal government received an email saying they could either accept a “deal” to resign and receive eight months of pay or remain in their jobs and risk being laid off soon. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">A few days later, on February 1, over 1,100 EPA workers, all of whom are still in the trial period of their positions, received a second email informing them that the administration has the right to immediately terminate them. While some of these employees are in their first year at the EPA, others had recently switched into new roles after spending decades in the agency. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">The following week brought another blow. The new Trump-appointed management announced their plans <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/06/nx-s1-5289331/epa-employees-who-work-on-environmental-justice-are-put-on-leave\">to close the Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights</a> and place 168 of its employees on administrative leave. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Staffers that spoke to Grist under the condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs blamed new EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, and the director of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, Elon Musk, for the job-cutting measures. </p>, <p>Grist thanks its sponsors. <a href=\"https://grist.org/advertising/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Become one</a>.</p>, <p class=\"modal-content__message\">To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider <a href=\"https://grist.org/how-to-whitelist-grist\" target=\"_blank\">disabling your ad-blocker</a> to allow ads on Grist. <a class=\"modal-content__link\" href=\"https://grist.org/how-to-whitelist-grist\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"modal-content__link-text\">Here's How</span><span class=\"icon-right-1\"></span></a></p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Zeldin has said he is committed to protecting Americans’ clean air and water. But, as Margot Brown, the senior vice president of environmental justice and equity at the Environmental Defense Fund told Grist, he has offered no plan towards achieving that goal. “It is the height of irresponsibility. It is the height of inefficiency,” Brown said, referring to the Trump administration’s actions so far. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Steve Gilrein, who spent 40 years working in the air division of the EPA’s regional office in Dallas, before retiring in 2022, echoed Brown’s concerns and chalked the agency’s moves up to a public relations stunt. “It’s for a splash and I think it’s the wrong way to do it,” he told Grist. “I’m not saying the government can’t be more efficient. But I wish there was a plan that focused on keeping a healthy EPA that provides the services it’s meant to provide.”</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Amid a storm of rhetoric about a bloated federal government, the events of the past two weeks raise questions about whether the EPA, an agency long plagued by budget and staff shortages, can continue to fulfill its legal obligations with a contracted workforce. Even before “efficiency” became the highest priority for federal agencies, the number of workers employed by the EPA had been declining for decades. “We’ve been steadily shrinking,” Gilrein said. “They just didn’t tell people.”</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">In the years after its founding in 1970, the EPA had only a few thousand staff members. Then, as the number of laws and programs under its purview grew — the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act — so did its workforce. The 1990s are often thought of as the agency’s golden years. During that decade, the workforce reached around 18,000 employees — a staffing apex that produced a flurry of new regulations for protecting the public from chemical dumping, tailpipe pollution, and petrochemical plant emissions.  </p>, <p>Grist thanks its sponsors. <a href=\"https://grist.org/advertising/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Become one</a>.</p>, <p class=\"modal-content__message\">To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider <a href=\"https://grist.org/how-to-whitelist-grist\" target=\"_blank\">disabling your ad-blocker</a> to allow ads on Grist. <a class=\"modal-content__link\" href=\"https://grist.org/how-to-whitelist-grist\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"modal-content__link-text\">Here's How</span><span class=\"icon-right-1\"></span></a></p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Staff numbers then began a long decline. The EPA shrank the most dramatically during President Barack Obama’s administration, then further during Trump’s first term. Federalism, Gilrein explained, was the reason for the trend that has continued until this moment. Federal programs to ensure compliance with laws like the Clean Air Act were increasingly outsourced to the states to run. But, for agencies like the EPA, federalism must have a balance point; there are certain things that states can’t — or shouldn’t — do on their own. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">During Trump’s first year and a half in office, approximately <a href=\"https://archive.is/98BIF\">1,600 workers</a>, or 18 percent of the EPA workforce, left. The exodus caused widespread “brain drain” that continues to afflict some agency programs to this day. Nonetheless, Brown, who worked at the time in the agency’s Office of Children’s Health Protection, recalled that there continued to be some level of cooperation between Trump’s first term appointees and EPA staff. Structural changes handicapped certain offices, and the budget limped along, but many staff members were able to keep their heads low and do their jobs.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“There was an unbelievable amount of oversight because there was immense mistrust in the staff, but it was nothing like today,” Brown said.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">President Biden’s four years in office amounted to a momentary aberration. <a href=\"https://grist.org/project/accountability/biden-environmental-justice-epa-tour-pollution-revisited-cancer-alley-houston-jackson/\">Biden and his EPA administrator Michael Regan</a> added hundreds of new staff members, advanced the federal climate policy objectives, and <a href=\"https://grist.org/equity/civil-rights-cancer-alley-louisiana-epa/\">strengthened enforcement against companies</a> in industrial corridors like Louisiana’s “Cancer Alley.” For as much promise as Biden and Regan brought, their approach angered conservative state politicians known to favor the oil and gas industry, resulted in a spate of lawsuits against the EPA, and set the stage for Trump’s second term.</p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Trump’s renewed mission to crush the agency promotes a severely limited type of federalism in which states have full power to administer the nation’s environmental laws as they please, with minimal oversight from the federal government. The problem with that approach, Gilrein said, is that it overlooks state environment agencies’ reliance on the EPA to fulfill practically every aspect of their mandates. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">During his four decades in the Region 6 office, Gilrein said that federal staffers worked “hand in hand” with the states, offering everything from technical guidance on regulatory decisions to millions of dollars in federal grant money. Agency staffers, many of whom have advanced degrees in fields like chemical engineering and toxicology, simply have expertise that states cannot afford with their limited budgets, Gilrein said. He recalled that under Obama and the first Trump administration, the regional office maintained positive relationships with the states in its jurisdiction, often helping them review permits and plan inspections. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“We wanted our states to be as strong as they could be,” he said. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">One current staff member in the air division told Grist that few colleagues he knew were even considering taking the “<a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5136860-federal-judge-extends-buyout-deadline/\">deal</a>,” believing that it was legally dubious and a bullying tactic to spur mass resignations. Furthermore, he continued, it was insulting to the American public that he should be able to collect a government salary while doing nothing for eight months. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Trump and his appointees are explaining their early actions against the EPA as measures to spur economic growth. But current and former staff told Grist that the importance of the EPA will come into sharper focus when it is no longer able to fulfill the duties that staff have long dedicated themselves to.  </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">For instance, the Office of Environmental Justice, which Trump <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-administration-cuts-environmental-justice-programs-epa-doj-sources-say-2025-02-06/\">recently announced</a> would be closing, is responsible for administering billions of dollars in funds to communities on the front lines of the climate crisis. Under the previous Trump administration, the office had about 30 staff members; today, that number is over 160. If the plan to dismantle the office is seen through, Brown warned, “it will be impossible for those funds to be managed appropriately.” </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">Gilrein wondered aloud if Trump had been able to get away with a lot of his rhetoric about the agency because the services it provides have long been invisible to the public. </p>, <p class=\"has-default-font-family\">“Why are you celebrating the dismantling of an agency that’s proven critical to human health and the environment?” Gilrein asked. “You take for granted that you can drink the water out of your faucet. You can do that because of the EPA.”</p>, <p></p>, <p>A message from   <svg class=\"site-logo__logo\" viewbox=\"0 0 305 103\">\n",

Andrew Harnik/Getty ImagesThis story was originally published by Grist and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. Within hours of being sworn into office on Monday, President Donald Trump announced a spate of executive orders and policies to boost oil and gas production, roll back environmental protections, withdraw from the Paris climate accord, and undo environmental justice initiatives enacted by former President Joe Biden.Trump has called climate change a “hoax,” and appointed fossil fuel industry executives and climate skeptics to his Cabinet. His first-day actions represent a complete remaking of the country’s climate agenda, and set the tone for his administration’s approach to energy and the environment over the next four years. Related6 things we learned from Day 1 about how Trump will governIs Donald Trump’s agenda actually popular?The Trump executive orders that threaten democracy“Drill, baby, drill”Among the most significant actions Trump took Monday was declaring “an energy emergency,” which he framed as part of his effort to rein in inflation and reduce the cost of living. He pledged to “use all necessary resources to build critical infrastructure,” an unprecedented move that could grant the White House greater authority to expand fossil fuel production. He also signed an executive order “to encourage energy exploration and production on federal lands and waters,” and another expediting permitting and leasing in Alaska, including in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. “We will have the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth, and we are going to use it,” Trump said during his inaugural address. “We are going to drill, baby, drill.”The US Strategic Petroleum Reserve can store 714 million barrels of crude oil, but currently holds about 395 million. Under his administration, he said, the cache will be filled “up again right to the top.” He also said the country will export energy “all over the world.”“We will be a rich nation again,” he said, standing inside the Capitol Rotunda, “and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help.”RelatedTrump wants a big expansion in fossil fuel production. Can he do that?Richard Klein, a senior research fellow for the international nonprofit Stockholm Environment Institute, noted that fossil fuel companies extracted record-high amounts of oil and gas during the Biden administration. Even if it is technologically possible to boost production further, it’s unclear whether that will reduce prices. Dan Kammen, a professor of energy at the University of California Berkeley, said it is a “direct falsehood” that increasing fossil fuel extraction would drive down inflation. He agreed that the US should declare a national energy emergency — but for reasons exactly the opposite of what Trump had in mind. “We need to quickly move to clean energy, to invest in new companies across the US,” Kammen told Grist.Exiting the Paris agreement (again)Trump delivered on his promise to once again withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, the United Nations pact agreed upon by 195 countries to limit global warming, which the new president referred to on Monday as a “rip-off.” In addition to signing an executive order saying the US would leave the agreement — titled “Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements” — Trump also signed a letter to the United Nations to set the departure in motion. Due to the rules governing the accord, it will take one year to formally withdraw, meaning US negotiators will participate in the next round of talks in Brazil at the end of the year. By this time next year, however, the US could join Iran, Libya, and Yemen as the only nations that aren’t part of the accord. “It simply makes no sense for the United States to voluntarily give up political influence and pass up opportunities to shape the exploding green energy market,” Ani Dasgupta, president and CEO of the nonprofit World Resources Institute, said in a statement. Only two in 10 Americans support quitting the Paris agreement, according to a poll by the Associated Press.RelatedThe Paris climate agreement is at risk of falling apart in the 2020sTrump’s announcement came just 10 days after the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared 2024 Earth’s hottest year on record, one marked by life-threatening heat waves, wildfires, and flooding around the world. Experts say things will only get worse unless the US and other countries do more to limit greenhouse gas emissions. “Much of the very fabric of life on Earth is imperiled,” climate scientists wrote last October. They noted then, even before Trump’s election, that global policies were expected to cause temperatures to climb 2.7 degrees Celsius (6.9 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100. One analysis by Carbon Brief estimated that a second Trump administration would result in an extra 4 billion metric tons of climate pollution, negating all of the emissions savings from the global deployment of clean energy technologies over the past five years — twice over.Reversing course on electric vehicles Trump also took action to revoke “the electric vehicle mandate,” in keeping with his campaign promise to support autoworkers.RelatedThe first electric minivan will change the way you think about EVs“In other words, you’ll be able to buy the vehicle of your choice,” he said during his inaugural address — even though there is no national mandate requiring the sale of electric vehicles and consumers are free to purchase any vehicle of their liking. The Biden administration did promote the technology by finalizing rules that limit the amount of tailpipe pollution over time so that electric vehicles make up the majority of automobiles sold by 2032. Under Joe Biden, the US also launched a $7,500 tax credit for consumer purchases of EVs manufactured domestically and planned to funnel roughly $7.5 billion toward building charging infrastructure across the country. “Rolling back incentives to build electric vehicles in the United States is going to cost jobs as well as raise the price of travel,” said Costa Samaras, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Carnegie Mellon University who served as a senior policy leader in the Biden White House. “Fueling up an electric vehicle costs between one-third and one-half as much as driving on gasoline, not to mention the benefits for reducing air pollution. Ultimately, to lower the price of energy for US consumers, we need to diversify the sources of energy that we’re using and ensure that these are clean, affordable, and reliable.”Rescinding environmental justice initiativesTrump signed a single executive order undoing nearly 80 Biden administration initiatives, including rescinding a directive to federal agencies to incorporate environmental justice into their missions. The Biden-era policy protected communities overburdened by pollution and directed agencies to work more closely with them. That move was part of a broader push that Trump described in his inaugural address as an attempt to create a “color-blind society” by stopping the government from “trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life.” Klein said the objective was “embarrassing.” Kammen said it was a “huge mistake” to move away from environmental justice priorities.Blocking new wind energy Trump officially barred new offshore wind leases and will review federal permitting of wind projects, making good on a promise to “end leasing to massive wind farms that degrade our natural landscapes and fail to serve American energy consumers.” The move is likely to be met with resistance from members of his own party. The top four states for wind generation — Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma, and Kansas — are solidly red, and unlikely to acquiesce. Even Trump’s pick for Interior secretary, Doug Burgum, refused to disavow wind power during a hearing last week, saying he would pursue an “all of the above” energy strategy.RelatedOffshore wind finally gets blowing in the USMany state and local policymakers, including the members of America Is All In, a climate coalition made up of government leaders and businesses from all 50 states, pledged to take up the mantle of climate action in the absence of federal leadership.“Regardless of the federal government’s actions, climate mayors are not backing down on our commitment to the Paris Agreement,” said Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, in a statement. “Our constituents are looking to us to meet the moment and deliver meaningful solutions.”See More: ClimateDonald TrumpPoliticsTrump AdministrationMore in this streamSee allThe lawsuit seeking to kick Elon Musk out of government, explainedBy Ian MillhiserTrump’s new passport rules are trapping transgender Americans in bureaucratic limboBy Rachel Cohen and Kelsey PiperHow to stop Trump’s power grabBy Zack BeauchampMost PopularTrump’s new passport rules are trapping transgender Americans in bureaucratic limboHow Democrats should respond to Trump’s war on DEIThe roots of Donald Trump’s fixation with South AfricaTake a mental break with the newest Vox crosswordTrump’s petty revenge on the artsToday, ExplainedUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

His first-day actions represent a complete remaking of the country’s climate agenda, and set the tone for his administration’s approach to energy and the environment over the next four years. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Among the most significant actions Trump took Monday was declaring “an energy emergency,” which he framed as part of his effort to rein in inflation and reduce the cost of living. He <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/01/president-trumps-america-first-priorities/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pledged</a> to “use all necessary resources to build critical infrastructure,” an unprecedented move that <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/01/20/nx-s1-5268653/energy-emergency-trump-oil-evs\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">could grant the White House</a> greater authority to expand fossil fuel production. He also signed an executive order “to <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">encourage energy exploration and production</a> on federal lands and waters,” and another <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-alaskas-extraordinary-resource-potential/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">expediting permitting and leasing in Alaska</a>, including in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">“We will have the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth, and we are going to use it,” Trump said during his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFvLorAL5-8&amp;t=3s&amp;ab_channel=ABCNews\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">inaugural address</a>. “We are going to drill, baby, drill.”</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">The <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/ceser/spr-quick-facts\">US Strategic Petroleum Reserve</a> can store 714 million barrels of crude oil, but currently holds about 395 million. Under his administration, he said, the cache will be filled “up again right to the top.” He also said the country will export energy “all over the world.”</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">“We will be a rich nation again,” he said, standing inside the Capitol Rotunda, “and it is that liquid gold under our feet that will help.”</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\"><a href=\"https://www.sei.org/people/richard-j-t-klein/\">Richard Klein</a>, a senior research fellow for the international nonprofit Stockholm Environment Institute, noted that fossil fuel companies extracted <a href=\"/climate/24098983/biden-oil-production-climate-fossil-fuel-renewables\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">record-high amounts of oil and gas</a> during the Biden administration. Even if it is technologically possible to boost production further, it’s unclear whether that will reduce prices. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\"><a href=\"https://erg.berkeley.edu/people/kammen-daniel-m/\">Dan Kammen</a>, a professor of energy at the University of California Berkeley, said it is a “direct falsehood” that increasing fossil fuel extraction would drive down inflation. He agreed that the US should declare a national energy emergency — but for reasons exactly the opposite of what Trump had in mind. “We need to quickly move to clean energy, to invest in new companies across the US,” Kammen told Grist.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Trump delivered on his promise to once again <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cc7f60ea-6f42-49d0-8fde-5151e170c780\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate agreement</a>, the United Nations pact agreed upon by 195 countries to limit global warming, which the new president referred to on Monday as a “rip-off.” In addition to signing an executive order saying <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/putting-america-first-in-international-environmental-agreements/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the US would leave the agreement</a> — titled “Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements” — Trump also signed a letter to the United Nations to set the departure in motion. Due to the rules governing the accord, it will take <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/10/trump-withdrawal-paris-agreement-different-00188002\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">one year</a> to formally withdraw, meaning US negotiators will participate in the next round of talks in Brazil at the end of the year. By this time next year, however, the US could join Iran, Libya, and Yemen as the only nations that aren’t part of the accord. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">“It simply makes no sense for the United States to voluntarily give up political influence and pass up opportunities to shape the exploding green energy market,” Ani Dasgupta, president and CEO of the nonprofit World Resources Institute, <a href=\"https://www.wri.org/statement-paris-agreement-withdrawal-erodes-americas-standing-world\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said in a statement</a>. Only two in 10 Americans support quitting the Paris agreement, according to a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-poll-pardons-tariffs-taxes-drilling-climate-7fa453197520f091feb8956737feb278\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">poll</a> by the Associated Press.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Trump’s announcement came just 10 days after the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared 2024 Earth’s <a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/news/2024-was-worlds-warmest-year-on-record\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hottest year on record</a>, one marked by <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/74/12/812/7808595?login=false\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">life-threatening heat waves</a>, wildfires, and flooding around the world. Experts say things will only get worse unless the US and other countries do more to limit greenhouse gas emissions. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">“Much of the very fabric of life on Earth is imperiled,” <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/74/12/812/7808595?login=false\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">climate scientists wrote</a> last October. They noted then, even before Trump’s election, that global policies were expected to cause temperatures to climb 2.7 degrees Celsius (6.9 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100. One <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-trump-election-win-could-add-4bn-tonnes-to-us-emissions-by-2030/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">analysis by Carbon Brief</a> estimated that a second Trump administration would result in an extra 4 billion metric tons of climate pollution, negating all of the emissions savings from the global deployment of clean energy technologies over the past five years — twice over.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Trump also took action to <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">revoke “the electric vehicle mandate,”</a> in keeping with his campaign promise to support autoworkers.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">“In other words, you’ll be able to buy the vehicle of your choice,” he said during his inaugural address — even though there is <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2024/07/18/after-musk-commits-180m-trump-says-hell-end-ev-mandate-that-doesnt-exist/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">no national mandate</a> requiring the sale of electric vehicles and consumers are free to purchase any vehicle of their liking. The Biden administration did promote the technology by finalizing rules that limit the amount of <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/20/climate/epa-biden-electric-cars/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tailpipe pollution over time so that</a> electric vehicles make up the majority of automobiles sold by 2032. Under Joe Biden, the US also launched a <a href=\"https://grist.org/transportation/ev-tax-credit/\">$7,500 tax credit</a> for consumer purchases of EVs manufactured domestically and planned to funnel roughly <a href=\"https://grist.org/cities/numbers-americans-want-drive-ev-rises/\">$7.5 billion</a> toward building charging infrastructure across the country. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">“Rolling back incentives to build electric vehicles in the United States is going to cost jobs as well as raise the price of travel,” said <a href=\"https://cee.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/samaras-costa.html\">Costa Samaras</a>, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Carnegie Mellon University who served as a senior policy leader in the Biden White House. “Fueling up an electric vehicle costs between one-third and one-half as much as driving on gasoline, not to mention the benefits for reducing air pollution. Ultimately, to lower the price of energy for US consumers, we need to diversify the sources of energy that we’re using and ensure that these are clean, affordable, and reliable.”</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Trump <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/initial-rescissions-of-harmful-executive-orders-and-actions/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">signed a single executive order</a> undoing nearly 80 Biden administration initiatives, including rescinding a directive to federal agencies to incorporate environmental justice into their missions. The Biden-era policy protected communities overburdened by pollution and directed agencies to work more closely with them. </p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">That move was part of a broader push that Trump described in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFvLorAL5-8&amp;t=3s\">his inaugural address</a> as an attempt to create a “color-blind society” by stopping the government from “trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life.” Klein said the objective was “embarrassing.” Kammen said it was a “huge mistake” to move away from environmental justice priorities.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Trump officially <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/temporary-withdrawal-of-all-areas-on-the-outer-continental-shelf-from-offshore-wind-leasing-and-review-of-the-federal-governments-leasing-and-permitting-practices-for-wind-projects/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">barred new offshore wind leases</a> and will review federal permitting of wind projects, making good on a promise to “end leasing to massive wind farms that degrade our natural landscapes and fail to serve American energy consumers.” The move is likely to be met with resistance from members of his own party. The <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/wind/where-wind-power-is-harnessed.php\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">top four states for wind generation</a> — Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma, and Kansas — are solidly red, and unlikely to acquiesce. Even Trump’s pick for Interior secretary, Doug Burgum, <a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/where-is-doug-burgum-on-wind-power/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">refused to disavow wind power</a> during a hearing last week, saying he would pursue an “all of the above” energy strategy.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1\">Many state and local policymakers, including the members of America Is All In, a climate coalition made up of government leaders and businesses from all 50 states, pledged to take up the mantle of climate action in the absence of federal leadership.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1\">“Regardless of the federal government’s actions, climate mayors are not backing down on our commitment to the Paris Agreement,” said Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, <a href=\"https://www.americaisallin.com/america-all-doubles-down-commitment-paris-agreement-despite-trump-withdrawal\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in a statement</a>. “Our constituents are looking to us to meet the moment and deliver meaningful solutions.”</p>, <p class=\"mr4kuae\"><span class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup\">Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.</span></p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1neefeej _1neefeee _1neefeef\">Exclusive: The US Fish and Wildlife Service has frozen millions of dollars, imperiling animals abroad.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1neefeej _1neefeee _1neefeef\">Don’t let the bitter cold fool you — the world just had the hottest January on record.</p>, <p class=\"duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1neefeej _1neefeee _1neefeef\">California’s last resort for fire insurance may fail.

The western Indian state of Maharashtra has formed a panel to study a proposal to ban petrol and diesel vehicles in Mumbai city amid worsening air quality and only allow electric or gas driven vehicles, it said in an order.Any ban on petrol, diesel vehicles in the financial capital, if implemented, may not only impact automobile manufacturers, but also citizens and businesses which rely heavily on these vehicles amid inadequate electric vehicle charging infrastructure and still developing metro rail networks.The city, home to the country's stock exchanges and offices of several global banks and multinationals, has seen air quality worsen since the pandemic amid growing traffic congestion and several ongoing infrastructure and construction projects.AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementMaharashtra's government said it has formed a seven-member committee to study the proposal of banning petrol and diesel vehicles and only allowing electric and compressed natural gas vehicles in the Mumbai metropolitan region following a court directive. The government order is dated Jan. 22 but gained public attention on Tuesday after Indian media extensively reported it.Earlier in January the Bombay High Court in its own public interest litigation directed the Maharashtra state government to constitute a committee of experts to study and see if it is feasible to phase out petrol-diesel driven vehicles.\"The vehicular emission is one of the main sources of air pollution.
