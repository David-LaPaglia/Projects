If you’re coming in here to talk about soup on paintings, don’t.

THERE CAN BE NO ART IF THE PLANET IS UNINHABITABLE
“Scientists will figure out how to fix it. They’ll invent something” 

Meanwhile scientists, “Please for fuck’s sake stop!”
I think there comes a point when you’ve tried everything under the sun, moon, and stars to get the attention of those in power making these choices-choices that are destroying our planet, our communities, our lives.

And still THEY HAVEN’T LISTENED.

We never stop, no you will not annihilate this planet and all of the life on it without us trying everything we know to do to STOP THIS MADNESS.

With this new regime in power it’s only going to get worse.

The time is now, the time was 2000 when the science was finally available for us all to see-but almost no one cared-25 years later and all the indicators say we are now at the PNR.

We do whatever it takes to make them listen, even if I have to get arrested fifty times and die trying-I will never stop fighting for the planet, the animals, the human life at stake.

We need a friggin galactic intervention.
Just finished reading Babel (RF Kuang) this week.


Empire/capitalism/colonialism/patriarchy ARE violence but have fooled us into thinking we must comply and keep their peace. 


They will class us as violent when we disrupt but we must continue to resist. 


May we all take strength from our collective power. We will continue on, we will outlive them. 
My latest “radical” act of protest has been trying to grow a ton of my own food and compost my own food and paper waste. 

Or is that my therapy from the world burning around me? Both?
Most of the great protests of history were considered radical and useless by the folk of the time, especially in the Civil Rights era. They were constantly maligned and discredited because that's what works on the public and they need the public against protestors if they want to keep power. But that only lasts so long. It only lasts as long as there are a handful of people. It's easy to call the people throwing soup on paintings insane radicals because there's only a few of them at a time. It's a lot harder to call groups of hundreds, thousands, or millions of people insane. They still try it, but 1.5 million people across the country getting out to protest police brutality turns heads. It attracts more people who agree. Eventually the numbers get so overwhelming that the establishment has no choice but to comply. Do you think George Floyd would have gotten justice without the protests? No, never. That's the only way for us to get things done. We need to do that now more than ever. It's just a shame that organizing this type of thing can be really, really hard. I just hope we can manage it in the coming months.
They will never be happy with *how* we protest.

Exert from *Dear Matafele Peinam*, a poem from Marshallese artist Kathy Jetñil-Kijiner about climate change and the impeding sinking of her country. Slide 2 made my think of this, most relevant lines highlighted

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc\_IgE7TBSY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc_IgE7TBSY) Video of it being read out in the UN. It got a standing ovation

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J06af5xHD0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J06af5xHD0) Documentary about the Marshall Islands and their impending destruction due to sea level rise, and where I first heard the poem.
The clapback of this man towards the conservative news reader, on the whys and hows of the Australian protest are completely satisfying to watch. I wish I had all those facts in order and the mental restraint to calmy rebutt alll the faux outrage

This kind of protest gets attention because the oil companies see it as an opportunity to make propaganda against climate activists. Wynn Bruce self immolated outside of the supreme court and it got barely any attention because it can't be spun as being immature or misguided.
I am a design major with an art history minor and I have supported these folks from the beginning. The anger that is directed at someone who throws soup at a GLASS CASE is fucking insane
[removed]
It's always funny to me when people complain that a painting is "unique and precious". Yeah guess what, nature is, too. Would be a shame if someone spilled paint all over that, right???
What will it take to save Mother Earth? We chain ourselves to buildings, self-immolate, threaten suicide and acts of terrorism, protest peacefully, vandalize famous works of art, take to the streets and beg the world to listen, and still, it is silent. It is not enough. When will it be enough? When will it all end?
Not to mention they aren't even damaging the original works because they are either behind thick glass or REPLICAS. Disruptive action works.
Many of the protest stunts are stupid. 

But that's the point. Normal protests don't get publicity anymore, just shut down by police. If you want to get your message out there, you need something attention grabbing.
There are still people throwing soup. The media is blocking all the news on the topic, blockades and soup are equally frightening in the eyes of our masters.
I’m a historian, I focus on material culture, I LOVE art and material culture and I genuinely think it’s the thing that makes humans human. Folks bring up the JSO protests like I’m going to get upset, and my response is always ‘I prefer nice disruptive protests like barricading major highways, but if the only thing that gets people listening is soup on a painting, soup ‘em all! If that’s what it takes, soup all the paintings!
Media sure paid a lot more attention to Greta Thunberg before she starting talking about the connection between climate change, capitalism, and imperialism.
I knew I found the right group for me 🥹 I wrote a poem after people were so upset about some spray paint on stone because I desperately wanted people to be upset about what really matters, and maybe I’ll share it here sometime.
I am an artist, too and huge art & history appreciator but it won’t matter how many art pieces we have preserved, if we don’t preserve the balance of the planet. The past doesn’t matter unless there is a future to remember it. 

Throw soup on everything, if that’s what it takes to wake each other up.
As far as I'm aware, none of the soup throwing actually permanently damaged any of the paintings, so I say go for it. You're deriving new meeting from old art, and isn't that like the entire point of preserving art?
Really annoys me when people care more about paintings and Stonehenge than the only known habitable planet in the galaxy.

People get angry with Just Stop Oil because they’re disruptive. Which says to me that people care more about civility than action.
Here’s a reminder that a century ago the Suffragettes, who in their day were ridiculed, infantilised, hated, even tortured in jail, were straight up attacking paintings with an axe - now history remembers them as heroines. Nowadays public discourse completely demonizes activists pretty harmlessly throwing soup at paintings (or more accurately, and as is so often left out of the story, the glass panes protecting those paintings). I think I know who will end up on the right side of history.
Look, I'm a write. I'm a musician. I adore art. I wpuld be heartbroken if these paintings were damaged, but as it is, it's literally just display cases in front of them. No harm, no foul, and it gets people talking. More power to them, I say. 

I may not be good at loud protests myself, but I like to fight for the environment in my own ways. Thanksgiving is a good time for us to think about combatting food waste a little. Use those carcasses to make a stock! Make leftovers into something new (in my case turkey enchiladas and turkey and wild rice soup). Compost what you cannot use. Throw as little away as possible. <3
Whatever you want to say about the *historical* value of art works. A lot of this stuff is traded by the super wealthy as a means of avoiding taxation and, in some corners, as a form of money laundering. Throwing soup at it is a means of attacking them twice. Be angry that oligarchs are commodifying not just the continuation of all life but the expression of the human soul.
The AMOC slowdown has doubled in speed, it's now on track to be 30% slower in 20 years not 40. We are looking at a dark future if we don't change things now.
The meek shall inherit the earth...

As the strong will have destroyed themselves.
They’re doing these practices so there can be history books in the future. Because if they don’t there won’t be enough humans to have societies that could print books, if there’s any humans left at all.
I feel it would have been funny (not necessarily appropriate, mind you) on so many levels if they'd targeted an Andy Warhol

(Warhol was famous for many things including his Campbell's Soup painting, and was also an avid environmentalist and known to make spectacles)
I’ve never felt more lost than reading comment sections where people are shitting on climate change protesters. Like…how did we get so collectively foolish.
Currently standing by my statement, throwing soup at protected framed artwork is great performing art. 

The only downsides could be that one time the guy pressed his head against the artwork and actually damaged it a bit, and whether they used or not AI art to cover the peonies painting.

I don't think I ever saw a vandalized painting that wasn't protected, I doubt damaging the art is the actual point, yet the top comments under the news articles are always like "Omg why do they want to destroy art ?!". That's, missing the point ?
I’m always annoyed by people who are like “when they’re disruptive like that, it hurts their cause.”

The same exact shit was said about MLK Jr.
A reminder that the majority of people who feign outrage over defaced artwork have no interest in conservatory or art; they are reactonaries who value the status quo -- be it inanimate objects or levers of power -- over social justice.
The reason the media talks about the soup throwers is because they think it's bad optics. But, you know, screw optics, we're in a fight for the future.
The status quo is always so keen for peaceful, respectful protest. It even holds it up as democracy in action… as long as it’s something that doesn’t inconvenience anyone and can be readily shoved to the side and ignored.

If soup on a painting is what gets people’s attention, then that’s what works.

Wonder if someone could get soup near that Warhol…
And most of these are behind glass as it is, so they're not even damaging things (although I know a couple of artists likely would enjoy a protest clean-up being woven into the story of their work). People are clutching their pearls over the janitor having to do extra work.

For many, if it's out of sight, it's out of mind. Where the greatest damages are happening to our environment is away from where people live, so people can just ignore it. If it's inconvenient for people, if it's in front of people, if it effects things people say they care about? THEN you pay attention. That's why we need to be able to assemble in public places.


Hell, Nature themselves is protesting, and Natural disasters still seem to be getting the "wow, this is happening a lot for no discernible reason!" Treatment.

Huh. I was certainly anti JSO before this, because of that exact mindset of what they were doing wasn't helping their cause. 

I still don't know if I personally agree with their tactics, but I can certainly respect them for it more than I used to.

Looks like I need to dig a little deeper than what the articles are saying at the surface level.
I wish I had a multitude of upvotes for this.

"Ehhh we are making money now, if it becomes a problem later we will invent something and make money off of the solution" - some CEO somewhere
This reminds me of my favourite [The Onion post](https://theonion.com/scientists-politely-remind-world-that-clean-energy-tech-1819576507/)
But also "science is demonic and part of the jewish global conspiracy to control everyone something something satanism, we're done with experts!"
I always think about this skit https://youtu.be/wCo3XwTRg9o?si=0WwkW_7GULPHybtj
artist speaking here; please, please. cover them all in soups. yesterday
PREACH
The science was actually first available in the 50s. No one has cared for over 70 years. 2000-ish was roughly when scientists achieved consensus, and the public started hearing about it.
It does make Superman's origins all the more believeable.

As far as I'm aware, life on the planet is not in any danger. It's survived worse

Humanity, on the other hand... Let's just say that there's a reason why our numbers only started growing after the climate stabilised.
Babel is one of the most unique and engaging novels I've ever read. I picked it up after The Poppy Wars. At this point, RF Kuang could publish her grocery list, and I'd read it.
Babel is SUCH a good book, how did you find it?
So then what is the appropriate strategy to get climate change ACTION implemented?  I agree, soup at paintings is horrible.  I think force-feeding suffragettes was horrible.  But I'm not clear if any OTHER strategies are shocking enough.  Surely rumptD filling his so-called cabinet with petroleum lovers isn't going to bring global warming to an end.?
The themes were good. As a book written to counter Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, it seemed rather weak in comparison.

As an examination of the history of colonialism and the subjugation of women and people of color? Babel is the victor and well written in that aspect.

As a wholistic understanding of a magical system/world, it fails to be believable overall. Not bad, but nowhere near as complete as Susanna Clarke’s world.

That’s not a real substantial critique, as the themes of anti-imperialism and fighting for justice with violence as an inevitable consequence of subjugation under Western economic exploitation are the real points of the book. But I felt it never really seemed to be pointed directly at Strange and Norrell.

Also, why is there so much implied racism against the supposed under-inventive darker ethnicities? Why didn’t they have silver magical ages that reflect their actual cultural achievements or the heights of their technological achievements?

It’s a book that leaves me more upset that there’s not more lore investigating in the book. So few connections and so few “spells” written into silver that we get to see. It’s not satisfying as a book about magic.

It is a great piece of literature that fully explains exploitation under Western hegemony.

Read both books. They both are very good.
 Both ❤️‍🩹🙏🧿🌈🍀✨
progressive movements used to have some serious teeth. we got complacent and lost it somewhere along the way - like I've even seen leftists criticize stuff like this. but this new regime is a great time to bring direct action back.
Exactly. The fossil fuel companies/billionaires benefit if they can portray climate activists as a small group of nutjobs. I predict what's eventually going to happen is a paradigm shift wrt climate where many more people realize that it's everyone's cause, and in all of our interests to make dramatic changes to our ways of life (that starts w the billionaires, not our own individual choices). Yes, it's looking bad in the US currently, but I actually think that will mobilize a lot more activism. Can we all just recognize that this is our only home and a relatively few greedy people/organizations are actively destroying it/blocking the changes that need to be made.
I always thought the soup thing was gonna help because its a problem enough. Leftists might not get it, in france my family complains about the farmers' protests BUT THEYRE THE ONES FEEDING YOU. Of course you're gonna have to be really problematic and criminal to make things change because all your other ways did not work. All protests started illegally. A lot of leftists don't understand that, they're on the left because they're not homophobic or racist, that's all, they're still uneducated on a lot of problems like migrations that they're against. Anyways.
Ooo Dune!

It’s so timely that Wicked is popular right now, I hope many people understand its messages about propaganda and how people who stand against the status quo/patriarchy are villainized
omg hi i recognize u from punk subs
The Marshall islands have been fucked over so bad. I couldnt believe it (I could) when I read a book about nuclear testing and the lies to cover it up.
She tries so hard to bait him… i envy his patience
Yes!!! 👏
The party line was that we shouldn't glorify suicide but that answer smells. We don't have an epidemic of people setting themselves on fire. That's a very intentional act of protest.
The level of protection and care we give property that we don't give people is insane!
I actually genuinely believe that the billionaire owned and controlled media made it seem like so many people were angry about the paintings when in reality, not many people were. I’m struggling to pay rent and buy groceries while watching massive storms decimate wide spread areas, I truly do not give a flying fuck about glass covering a painting getting splashed with soup. And no one I personally know cared either. Everyone I know IS concerned about the environment and scared about climate change.

I’m sure in 150 years, if we still have a civilization, they’ll look back on this time period in scorn of the ultra-wealthy and say, “look at how they manipulated the media to enrich themselves. Look at how those selfish assholes destroyed the planet so they could have a few more bucks”. Elon Musk and his ilk will not be looked upon fondly
The conversation's meant to be about disruptive protest, not specifically soup on paintings.
Mother Earth will be fine, it's the humans who are fucked
All I’ll say is I know they definitely researched what painting to do that too, but if anyone else is pondering an extreme protest do be careful. Not all museums have protective glass or are displaying replicas.

*edit: hopefully none misinterpret this, but this isn’t me expressing dislike or saying extreme acts of protest aren’t good*
A quick google search would show all these people who miss the point of protest, that the painting wasn’t damaged in any way. It was covered in glass. And now thanks to that protest, people are talking about climate change. 

This protest inspired me to learn more about how to vote progressively in a system that is against any progressive change, and also how to take care of myself in the midst of massive social change that is overwhelming and scary.
Good points! But they're not actually destroying anything. They throw soup/paint on the glass enclosures, and use non-harmful materials. Nothing is actually being damaged. People just get outraged without knowing the facts.
The real crime is that art dealers are making 99.9999999% of all the money, while the original artists were likely poor and/or uncredited in their time.

And art dealers are just used car salesmen with classier product. They get paid to market stuff, *not to create* anything. The creators should get all the money, ideally.
Exactly. People who say "you just lost a customer" who were never customers in the first place.
And then climate refugees get villainized.
JSO has not defaced anything. Everything they do is temporary or easily removable.
Mod literally said if you’re here to talk about soup on paintings, don’t, and yet here you are 🤣 That painting was not permanently defaced or damaged in any way
You're gonna get sick if you keep licking so many boots

It’s not supposed to be a solution, it is a disruptive act to the normal violent order of society. You’re kind of proving the necessity right now, you’re more upset and critical about a style of actual activism than the world being destroyed by greed.

NO ART IS DESTROYED. Just google it ffs.

Thank you for sharing this gem!
So there were government discussions on this, in the 60s if I recall correctly. As a child in the 90s I was already aware of global warming as a concern. 

The issue is that around the time you’re referring to, it became a matter of panic. 

Because since it was known in the 50s there’s been an active disinformation campaign against it.
[removed]
No. The rate of change is what’s the really bad part. And there’s never been a climate catastrophe that’s happened over such a short period of time. It’s expected to kill pretty much all life on the planet. Bacteria and cockroaches notwithstanding..

I loved the Poppy Wars!

Picking up Babel as soon as I can find it (and then her grocery list ofc).
Very excellent!! The writing is beautiful, and world building is so immersive. Seeing different aspects of myself in each of the 4 students is enlightening as well: shows where my strength is and where I can continue to grow. 
Please, for the love of god, point me towards disruptive leftist groups that are actually planning stuff. Everywhere I look people are just complaining without organizing and I don't know where to start.
