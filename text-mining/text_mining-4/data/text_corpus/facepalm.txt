Now, when you stand in the water and pee it creates a cold spot.
"The ice we skate, is get'n pretty thin. The water's getting warm, so you might as well swim..."
Istg these people are just gonna say ‚Äúit‚Äôs fine I can just turn up my ac‚Äù
Theres gonna be a strong ass hurricane
Bye algae!  I hope we don't need 50% of our oxygen.
I live in the Tampa area. I went to the beach two weekends ago and the water was uncomfortably warm. It wasn't even cooling me off
I reckon experts aren‚Äôt really so stunned. I reckon experts are pretty annoyed that anyone‚Äôs surprised at this point after the decade of dire warnings they kept giving.
That's just woke Mother Nature. Ron will be suing her soon enough, don't worry
Relax guys this republican dude made a snowball once so it's not getting hotter.

Thats 38.4 ¬∞C for the rest of the world...

I went to Mexico (an hour flight from Miami) and the water there was almost as bad as just walking around
Climate change is def real and a serious issue that we (as a species) may be too late to fix. This years temperatures are a crazy mix of weather patters and other disasters happening all at once. El Nino is cranking things up in the pacific, Canadian wildfires releasing more CO2 and creating heat domes (early in the season but already the worst season on record for Canada), weaker winds pushing less dust from the Sahara over to South America, less dust over the Atlantic means more sunlight, Antarctic sea ice is barley forming (winter there now).

It‚Äôs like an avalanche of effects and I‚Äôm not sure what it will take for people in power to wake up. Things will change faster than we can react and by that time I fear it will be too late. The rest of this year will be crazy.
Whelp, we're fucked. It was fun while it lasted.
We are fucked. 70% of our oxygen is dependent on phytoplankton in the ocean that‚Äôs highly sensitive to temperature.
Playing with fire.
There's going to be a massive coral die-off.
No, it‚Äôs done. It‚Äôs happening. We don‚Äôt need agreement or even acknowledgement. We need to find solutions. The problem is what it is. Let‚Äôs figure that out.
Baffles me how in denial of climate change a state that stands to get battered by hurricanes is. Warm seas spell bad news the next few months.
I‚Äôm gonna play assassins creed through the apocalypse, what about you guys?
$1,000,000,000,000 says that people that don't believe in climate change will say "oh that sounds nice to me!"
[Skewed data but still concerning ](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2023/07/25/florida-ocean-temp-tops-over-101-degrees-fahrenheit-possible-record.html)
I dont deny climate change, just all the bullshit reasons they're suggesting as causes.  It's Always the everyday man's fault, never the huge industry dumping pollutants a billion times more than the average person.
We were past the point of no return some time ago, at this point the best we can hope for is damage control.  Give we can‚Äôt even agree on masks or vaccines I have little hope anything meaningful will be done.
Thank god for places like MOTE, UMiami, and Florida aquarium for trying to combat this. Seriously, they need all the help they can get to save floridas reefs
I think climate change is real. I also think we're fucking stupid about it. China and India are major contributors, but we let them get away with it. 

I also think we should hurry up and transition over to nuclear power and get off coal. We need low-maintenance cheap energy. Wind and Solar are nice, but fucking expensive. Fucking. Expensive. If you bankrupt people by trying to save the world, you'll create more people that wont give a fuck for long-term success, and start doing shit that only promises the short term.
That will certainly kill fish. At that temperature oxygen in the water decreases drastically
This is going to be fun hurricane season
I promise, no expert is stunned by this. They have literally been warning us for well over a decade
"Nothing to see here"

--Ron DeathSentence
Imagine having to get out of the ocean to cool off.
"ThE cLiMaTe Is AlWays ChAnGinG"--my conservative folks
The fact that is happening in the state that voted for DeSantis is some sort of divine Justice
Almost everyone in the world believes in climate change except for American Republicans
RIP fish
Actual question: why don't some people believe climate change is real?
Climate change deniers are just as bad as flat earthers, change my mind
If you think this is going to change their minds, you haven‚Äôt been paying attention. 

They will literally be dying from a flood and still find a way to blame the libs.
It‚Äôs a 100% real I see whales on beaches everywhere now
The Climate must have taken  the Covid Vaccine, obviously
It‚Äôs funny how when‚Äôs it really cold or we get a lot of snow anti climate change people will be like dur dur where‚Äôs your climate change, and all people thinking the sky is falling in these comments are like *crying liberal girl meme* that‚Äôs not how climate change works!!! But this article comes out and everyone‚Äôs like yup, that‚Äôs how it works. That‚Äôs it. 

Climate change is real and happening but it‚Äôs not going to be instant. Anomalies will happen. We will have mild summers and cold winters and everything in between. This sounds more like an anomaly.
This is so fucking scary!!
Time to drop a giant ice cube in the ocean and end the problem once and for all.
Let them boil like the lobsters they are!

So here is my question for everyone. When humanity is gone or greatly diminished, do you think the planet will recover? Or have we reached the point it's no longer recoverable and run away greenhouse makes Earth the new Venus?
Went to Florida last year and went to siesta key beach. It was insanely hot outside and the water gave absolutely no reprieve. I‚Äôve never been that hot in my life.
You forget! Florida is conservative and thinks that this is just a liberal hoax! The water doesn't know what temperature is!!!
That‚Äôs terrifying, hurricane season is gonna be horrible
My baby boomer co-worker, who's definitely a climate change denier, keeps saying things like (we live in Minnesota),

"I can't believe this smoke, I've never seen a fire season like this and I've lived in this area almost my whole life! What could be causing all of this?!"

Like damn, I don't fucking know...
No?
We‚Äôre vacationing in Greece right now and have done so annually since I was a little kid and yes we see soaring temps here too. Just like every single summer I can remember. For the past forty years. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
As a non US citizen reading the title all i could think of is "did physics just break".
Scanned the comments, shocked their isn‚Äôt an ‚Äúactually in 19-whenever the fuck the water saw 102 degrees! Checkmate left wing!‚Äù
It really feels like were entering a runaway phase of climate change.
HYPERCAINE Incoming!
That's some hurricane fuel right there
It‚Äôs just a phase‚Ä¶. /s
So are we just...Fucked? Are we all going to die?
The hotter the water, the stronger the hurricanes.  Do the math.
Hurricanes don't want you to know,  but they love warm water
Oh we‚Äôre way past stopping this. There is no going back. Combined with the Gulf Stream potentially stopping, this is the beginning of the end
Denying climate change is silly. Even so silly is trying to combat it, without the use of nuclear power.
I guarantee you some muricans will rather believe someone put a heater in the water than global warming
i dont think people deny it gets warmer, what causes it to be warmer is the point of contention
In 1990, the USA had a population of 249 million, and today is at  340 million. Even with almost 37% more population, total C02 emissions are down since 1990.

In that same time period, South Korea is up about 200%, Saudi Arabia is up about 350% India is up over 400%, and China is up about 500%.

I wonder why we don't hear more about how the USA has reduced their emissions, even with significant population growth. 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_countries\_by\_carbon\_dioxide\_emissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions)
i hope we all die honestly
Yea and all is good otherwise in the world ‚Ä¶thx republicans
Republicans are still denying climate change
Shark central surely?
Oh thank goodness Climate change is just a myth! Hahahaha!
Rookie numbers
By the time everyone agrees that climate change is a problem that needs to be addressed it will be too late.
And not a single hurricane this season yet
This will all eventually equal itself out and will go back to normal.  Human beings may not be around to witness it though.
Imagine how powerful the hurricanes are going to be this year.
LMAO and global warming isn't real? Bunch of morons
Prepare for the water wars now.
DeSantis is trying to kill off those "woke" pregnant male sea horses to own the libs.
At this point I‚Äôm almost convinced it‚Äôs for the best that we all die. So many fucking morons everywhere I‚Äôm so sick of it
Gotta hand it to the Chinese, they‚Äôre really committed to this global warming hoax. 

/s
I highly doubt real experts are stunned. This has been coming for decades.
I‚Äôm gonna need to see a pic of the actual thermometer to believe that.
You forget! Florida is conservative and thinks that this is just a liberal hoax! The water doesn't know what temperature is!!!
Honey did you leave the burner on when we left?
Can someone tell me why global warming doesn't affect the UK? I lived there (with my boyfriend, now husband) for almost a year and the highest the temp. got was in the 70's. There's a joke they have: 'Summer was great in Scotland this year. This time it came on a Wednesday.' Seriously though, why doesn't it affect the whole planet? My husband would love a little global warming where he lives. \*sorry if this is a dumb question, but I truly don't understand why this is\*
That can kill all fish in the water
The climate is always changing.  That doesn‚Äôt mean we will all die if you don‚Äôt stop eating meat and drive a golf cart.
The global south has been having a lot of heat waves, and abnormal disasters, there's been enough evidence already. But people just refuse to believe it
Buoy that‚Äôs hot.
100 degrees in normal metric system would mean death
Meanwhile I keep getting notified of Temps being at record lows for July
That's 38 degrees Celsius
*Stunning Experts*
I call bs.
Okay, in the defense of idiots, if "experts are stunned," then it's sort of understandable that the average person might think experts don't always know what they're talking about.
Probably want to research El Ni√±o. It would keep you for looking like suckers for taking the bait.
Haven't you guys heard of El Ni√±o? This whole thread says a lot xD
Climate change is real, it's a natural process. If you mean that humans affect the climate change, then you are also right. I just would be cautious to take one event as proof for something that may take hundreds of years.

Btw. My opinion is that humanity accelerated the natural climate change. Therefore telling that we need to stop the climate change is as wrong as stating everything is ok.

We need to normalise it again and adapt to the changes. There is a reason why we find the remains of stone age villages 20m underwater
The people of the GCC : Amateurs.
I remembering when Obama said that a Republican senate member brought in a snowball as "this is the proof that there is no climate change!" 
*If somebody is so stupid they don't understand the basics, you can't start arguing with them!*
Stop worrying, Futurama already solved this problem. Just drop a giant ice cube into the ocean
It‚Äôs not too hard to limit global warming, it‚Äôs just people are either too stupid or corrupt to do it
