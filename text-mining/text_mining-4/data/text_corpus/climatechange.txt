The next two months will be the peak hurricane season where 15 hurricanes are predicted. Upcoming events may finally force them to accept climate change.
Climate change is illegal in Florida
Great. Floridian migrants. Like peanut butter, they'll be spreading their nuttiness all over the US.
Zero sympathy for climate deniers.

Edit:¬†y‚Äôall are making some wild assumptions about me based off of this comment.¬†

A. Let‚Äôs start with the fact that I am from the south, love it, and have family everywhere from Florida, to Georgia (home state), Alabama, North Carolina, and Louisiana.¬†
B. My comment wasn‚Äôt political. I couldn‚Äôt care less whether you are Republican or Democrat. Met plenty of smart, level headed folks from both sides and an equal amount of people believing in nonsense such and climate change deniers and antivaxxers.
C. My comment was simply that people who are climate deniers and are complaining about the severe weather (yep this includes family members) get no sympathy from me. Just like I had no sympathy for people that were antivaxxers and then when they got COVID (yep this also includes family members) were complaining about how terrible it was‚Ä¶gee if only there was something‚Ä¶say a vaccine that only prevents you catching but also drastically alleviates all the symptoms.
They possibly will migrate. 

Insurance will go bankrupt.
Then the economy can't function.
‚ÄúUnless the county fixes the problem I won‚Äôt be fixing my home.‚Äù Were thoughts and prayers not good enough?
Climate change will affect everywhere to some degree. I live in the great lakes and heavy(200-500year) rains and flash flooding are things locally where I live. I have been busy improving my home and property appropriately for that.

However Florida and other states have it so much wore. Coping and adjusting will be become increasingly difficult.
They should have gotten the hint years ago.  How many hurricanes does it take, Ten, twenty, thirty?  The insurance companies got the hint a few years ago, they are all pulling out.  The federal government - you know the funding agency that Floridians hate so much, except when they need to be bailed out of the deep water of their idiocy, has been stretched to the limit and now is underwater itself -- all those bad puns are intended.

Personally, I can do with oranges and lemons.  Cannot wait until the entire limp penis of the North American continent goes into the sea.
climate change, like gravity, doesn't really care if you "believe" in it or not. 100 years ago, they pulled 8-foot blocks of ice out of rivers as far south as Cincinatti. Now the Detroit River doesn't freeze over. Ignore at your own peril!
says here that the majority of floridians believe climate change.

"90% of Floridians believe climate change is happening"

Okay, better late than never as they say but is it the same thing for those who are in charge at the state level or are they still in denial, I wonder‚Ä¶
No they are not go look at the subreddit
Relax, The Don said it's fake news. He wouldn't lie to make money. /S
Florida needs a governor who is willing to deal with science and reality.  Get rid of Desantis. He will not help you or your family.
"Max Defender 8 Chief Meteorologist Jeff Berardelli said Tropical Storm Debby‚Äôs rainfall was a one in 200 year event for Sarasota County."

Hmm. I wonder if it was a one in 200 year event, that's now happening every 20 years...
I live in Ohio and my relatives in Florida love to debate me on climate change when I visit. All I have to say is, "So let me get this straight... you disagree with the world's leading experts... because you've Googled 'global warming hoax' a couple times??" üòë
I can say one thing, whos going to foot the bill for rebuilding when the insurance companies completely call it quits? The government thats who, and who supports the government? we do. So we will be paying to rebuild them after every hurricane. Then there is the fact homeowners car owners renters anyone who has insurance or does business with companies that have to pay insurance will see everything go skyhigh , from insurance to the food and gas prices. 

This is an incoming economic disaster for the whole country not just florida, we are all going to pay the price because everything is backed by the insurance companies in this country. It will all get put on the consumer and passed down to us.
The actuaries pricing risk are in the process of making Florida unaffordable for the middle class.   The wage scale in the state isn‚Äôt high enough to offset insurance costs.   It‚Äôs priced into rent, too.  And auto insurance.   It will be priced into private mortgage insurance because of the risk of price collapse.  New construction to meet the latest hurricane building code is expensive.
I'd be unloading any properties l might own in Florida. In 30 years or less, they will be unsellable.
And they will be blaming scientists for not making them aware of the problem - and threatening that they better get off their asses and fix this now.
Well, I don't see any slow down in housing permit applications in Florida
We sold our house at almost peak value in Sarasota in January. Feeing pretty smart right now. Seemed like a pretty obvious move with a 30 year mortgage‚Ä¶ what will that place be like then?!
Have you tried telling the powerful winds and heavy rains that they‚Äôre just fake?
This is a real issue.  Vermont has had conferences where they've discussed the issue of where to house climate refugees.  The Northeast already has a major housing issue. 

And besides, Floridians used to cement everywhere - condos, strip malls, strip clubs, golf courses - aren't really compatible with the more rural and environmentally focus state of Vermont.
Wait, didn't desantis ban climate change?
Well if they can at least not make it worse by not voting for Orange Man that‚Äôd be great
This works out great for the Republicans, the ones who get the message are displaced and will have trouble voting.
A hint???? my friend we are well past that point.
 The whole state is ultimately doomed over the next thousand years with the majority of it ending up under water. That said most major cities are coastal cities and will suffer the same fate. New York, Houston, Philadelphia, LA/sanfran/sandiego, Seattle, Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, London, Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Tokyo, Beijing, Shanghai, Mumbai, Cairo, Dhaka, Karachi, Buenos Aires, Istanbul, Manila, Berlin, Hong Kong, ect ect, are all doomed to sink beneath the waves in the end.
If you pull up a Maps picture of the Sarasota neighborhood that flooded you will understand why. Greedy developers are putting houses in known flood zones knowing out of state buyers will assume distance from coast is the only concern. This piece of land flooded in 2017. The entire neighborhood is a giant retention pond with streets laid on top.
Both my parents, standard right-wing climate change deniers, have been living on the coast for some time - and are now speaking about climate change as a reality.
Oh god. Florida refugees. That is a terrifying combination of words.
The proof is just look at their governor and his beliefs. Who cares more about money and power and he does the people of his state. A real man could admit he‚Äôs wrong.
Those discussions are being had where people in government still think.
Too late for Florida and many coastal communities.
They will just be apathetic towards the weather ‚Äî these are dedicated contrarians.
I agree that millions, or at least hundreds of thousands in Florida will have to move in the next decade or two. An important question is whether they will be compensated for the total loss of their homes. Insurance companies are dropping coverage for these high risk homes.
But, but I‚Äôm dodging taxes so I‚Äôm still winning the bag! /s
I predict over the next 10 years they will have more people moving in than moving out, from places like California (unfortunately, it‚Äôs lovely there) New York, and now Minnesota (I live in MN and it‚Äôs getting progressively worse, while at the same time it‚Äôs going to become a climate destination, especially the Duluth area)
[deleted]
Then they should vote like it.
Sorry but FEMA should cut Florida off. You can‚Äôt keep helping someone who refuse to help themselves.
It‚Äôs coming for all of us.
so this was a couple years ago i read that the water in south florida reach 100¬∞ and animals we're basically being cooked alive in hot water. manatees, etc. if that doesn't convince you of climate change i dunno what would.
I wonder how many more insurance companies are going to pull out of Florida and other east coast states or communities?
Florida refugees are already in the Carolinas...
And they have a great governor who really believes in climate change.
I'm an actual middle aged Florida-born person.  A true Floridian.  I don't fit the mold and everyone seems to think I'm from NYC, but this is home.

I will outlast Florida Man, because Florida Man is actually just ill-equipped transplants from Ohio and New Jersey.   

Floridians are heat trained, storm prepared, and we know damn well enough where to build and not.  That neighborhood that's still under water in Sarasota?  I'd wager not a lot of native Floridians live there unless it was a last resort.

In Florida, and I mean real Florida (where we have no "accent" and can pass as being from anywhere but Texas) we can read elevation maps, love science (meteorology and aeronautics have a tight relationship in this state), we love and study our oceans.  Florida Man is a dumb Jersey low life.  Real Floridians launch rockets, entertain millions, keep clean beaches, invent computers (Atanasoff), herd cattle (the original cowboys are from here) and live with the land, animals, and weather.

We can't solve the **stupid** that's here right now... but if we can stop the gerrymandering Republicans long enough to get both parties, and Independents, back in the game here in local and state elections, we can get our education system working, teach the next generation (who may actually be Floridians), and stop being dumb and greedy enough to build in literal cypress swamps.

Nature literally showed us where the water would run, but dumb ass developers from out of state came here and thought they could use what they learned in the mountains, plains, or where ever else and it'd work here.  Nope.  Here, you don't conquer the land... you work with it or she'll wipe you out every time. 

It's a nice feeling to think that humanity conquered our environment... but we didn't.   In Florida we know it's all a lie, but Ohio-man who becomes Florida-man... he brings all his incorrect Ohio-gained assumptions here and inflicts himself, and others, with them. 

Just felt like saying hi and putting this here for anyone who wants to read it.
The really fucked up part is that the same people who have opposed anything to mitigate climate change will all demand government bailouts and want taxpayers to reimburse homeowners and property owners for their losses when they move out.
Im loving the schadenfreude of all of these stories about boomers who are stuck being uninsured because insurers now just refuse to cover properties in the state.  All this woe is me after decades of denial and/or just narcissistic pushback.
Think saying doom the state is exaggerating surely. Average elevation is 100 feet and seems unlikely it will get to that level any time soon. But yeah if I lived right on the coast I'd be getting out pronto in fact I'd already have cleared out.
Floridians ‚Äúgetting the hint‚Äù is a mighty bold claim that needs even bolder evidence. Flipping blue in November would be a start.
Florida will be under water soon enough.
Only once 100% of Americans believe in climate change will we be able to start making progress.¬†
Too late suckers! That ship has sailed!
I live in Ohio and my relatives in Florida love to debate me on climate change when I visit. All I have to say is, "So let me get this straight... you disagree with the world's leading experts... because you've Googled 'global warming hoax' a couple times??" üòë
That‚Äôs illegal
So they want government help?
Wonder if the govner has any more of those flights to Martha's Vinyard
But they took it out of their books, so its gotta be safe right.
Yes, we FINALLY are.
Hope they stay there   And face the consequences of their laws we don‚Äôt want any more people in my state and less from Florida.
Flooding had been getting worse for a while. A1A in Fort Lauderdale started flooding simply due to high tides. They get dump trucks and throw dredged sand down to fight the beach erosion. Hopefully they don‚Äôt do it during sea turtle season. 
I moved there in 1997 with my folks and left in 2021. My dad left in 2022 bc insurance went nuts after Ian. I brought my friend from Miami a few months ago. I feel bad for those who don‚Äôt have the means to move. The climate deniers can enjoy the ocean being in their living room.
Governor Meatball Ron is banning books and pot, and I can't afford homeowner's insurance anymore. Great job, Republicans!
As Ron desantis said last year"all the insurance companies will come back after hurricane season".
Nothing would give me greater joy than denying Floridians refuge. They asked for it.
Really climate change?! I‚Äôm shocked absolutely shocked! You‚Äôre telling me heavily polluting the planet would come back to bite us in the ass?! What‚Äôs next you‚Äôll tell me big companies knew this would happen? I thought we could trust the big guys as they‚Äôve always had our best interests at heart. I guess we gotta give them more tax breaks and rally the masses behind them for old times sake and chant drill baby drill. Surely that‚Äôll solve climate change! /s

Fucking took em long enough.
Go to r/sarasota‚Ä¶.. all screaming for more fema money‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not going to get better for them
‚Ä¶and meanwhile the Republican government forbids any discussion of it.
you think the state that has a literal trope called Florida Man (phone automatically capitalized that) is going to get the hint? Florida Man will be floating through Tampa on a raft made of Reebok shoes and bud light cans before they get the hint
They will all be poor and homeless. Guess maybe THEN the laws regarding the homeless will change
It doesn't exist because there is now a law against it! The Florida Governor knows how to handle this lie! Of course, that's why I live in Hawaii now...

[https://www.npr.org/2024/05/17/1252012825/florida-gov-desantis-signs-bill-that-deletes-climate-change-from-state-law](https://www.npr.org/2024/05/17/1252012825/florida-gov-desantis-signs-bill-that-deletes-climate-change-from-state-law)
At this point, I'd think it's best to wait until Florida is totally under water before we take any drastic steps...
I don't buy it. Floridians don't get hints. Or detailed scientific explanations backed by Powerpoint. Or frying pans on the head.
Sorry, the guy on the article won't fix his house until the county fixes the problem? The problem of climate change? Not sure one county can fix that by itself.
Reading through that I don't get the sense ther get it.  They are just insisting the government fix the problem.

Sadly, many of these are people who will vote out ant politician who speaks the truth about climate change.

I feel bad for people who lose their homes and belongings, but it is also very annoying to see the "small government" climate change deniers demand magical fixes when it's their property, but go back to "climate change is fake!" when it happens elsewhere.
Need to build that wall around Florida to Protect Georgia!
Florida already fixed climate change by banning the government from using the words ‚Äúclimate change‚Äù Done. Now ‚Äúclimate change‚Äù is not allowed to hurt them. It‚Äôs gonna have to be something else. Mission accomplished.
The guy quoted in the article says ‚Äúif they don‚Äôt fix this they‚Äôre going to see a for sale sign in front of my house. I‚Äôm not going to spent my hard earned money on renovations if they let this happen again.‚Äù 

Just one question Ben‚Ä¶ sell your house to who? AQUAMAN?
You are implying they have the grace, integrity, and fortitude to admit that they not only made a terrible mistake but that they could have been working on ways to lessen the suffering of other people. 

They argued heavily against the reality of global warming so they could continue to enjoy a lifestyle based on everyone suffering for their whims and pleasure. 

I'm afraid you mistake the character of Florida MAGAs. Their help can't take water breaks, says the law made by the politicians they elected.
Oh goody all the shitty Florida people going to move up here...
The blue states will pay to relocate them and cover the cost of the housing they leave behind because blue states elect idiots who won't put a stop to red state greed.
Ik some of these Florida jokes are funny but keep in mind many of those worst effected are going to be poor, and/or minorities who went to Florida to escape one thing or another. I'm thinking particularly of Puerto Ricans who left because of Hurricane Maria- arguably another climate disaster. Migrants who work in agriculture will also be incredibly vulnerable.
They will never admit it. They are already saying "yes it's real, but we didn't do it and there is nothing we can do about it"

They just change the talking points. This fight is worthless
It‚Äôs illegal to even discuss that in Free Florida. It has been removed from all government documents in the state.
It's Florida. This happens ever summer. Nice try.
For those who don't know, Florida is **very** flat and **very** close to sea level. It's basically a thin layer of marsh on top of a giant phosphorous deposit, only they turned a lot of the swamp into subdivisions and cities, so now the land is no longer so good at slowing down storms that pass over it.

The rate of sea level rise will be very slow. It is increasing at the rate of millimeters per year. But Florida will be one of the first to go underwater. Many home insurers are already refusing to insure homes in that state, or are jacking up home insurance rates to levels many can't afford.

And the delicious irony is that many of those Florida residents voted to make climate change happen faster. They are going to lose their homes in order to "own the libs."

I lived in that state for 4 years. Whatever impression you got about Florida from those "Florida man" news stories, I promise you that the reality is worse.
I live in a +55 community in NY.  My neighbors on both sides and across the street are New Yorkers who moved to Florida and moved back.  Could not take the shit show.
Wait wait wait‚Ä¶you think Floridians‚Ä¶are going to accept climate change? The people who believe the earth is flat, the government took away the old sun and replaced it, and that Trump is literally the messiah? Yeah no way. They‚Äôll just make up some wild conspiracy theory and find a way to blame ‚Äúthe left‚Äù.
If we just pay taxes it goes away
The sooner that state falls into the ocean the better.
I want my tax money back for encouraging these fools to move here, why do we keep bailing them out? Pre global warming it was bad, now forget about it
Let them all burn in hell or climate change. Whatever comes first to shitty ass state.

I have no doubts about climate change but Florida has been hit by hurricanes forever and if the climate went back to normal the hurricanes would continue. 

What‚Äôs going to create climate refugees from Florida is sea level rise which isn‚Äôt as sexy as hurricanes. It‚Äôs slow and inexorable
If anyone deserves this, it‚Äôs Florida
This article is embarrassingly poorly written.
