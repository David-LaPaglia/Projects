I'm from Spain, specifically from Burgos the city that used to be regarded as "coldest" of Spain. I remember that when I was a child it used to snow all winter, now we may get one good snow every year.

We've been talking about the strange weather we are experiencing, we ask ourselves... If we have this heat now in April, what can we expect to have in summer? 

We are worried, is not mainstream or talked about that much in television but for the first time Barcelona has allowed to fill the pools as "public health" even when our water reserves are low. I'm worried because in Burgos the heat is new, we don't have any air conditioning here since it has never been necessary in summer... But in recent years we are starting to think we might have to get air conditioning in what, I repeat, was once regarded as the cooldest city in Spain. 

There is not many climate change deniers in Spain, even when I talk to old people which you would maybe imagine to be conservative, they all say the same: they have seen the climate change drastically during their lives.
I think about 10 years ago we had the worst outbreak of tornadoes in our area's history.

A couple years ago, we had another outbreak of tornadoes that destroyed our house.

When we went to rebuild it, we had to lay down another 50+ truck loads of dirt to raise the area for the house because the flood plain had changed.

Then just spring last year, we had an active tornado warning every single weekend for 5 weeks straight.

The weather this spring has been swinging wildly between the mid 40's at night and the mid 80's during the day.

I used to get harassed by bees, hornets, and mosquitos like mad this time of year, and right now I'm lucky if I even see one of any of the three of those at all during the day.

Climate change is happening right here, right now, before our very eyes. The fact that over 50% of participants believe climate change is happening now or soon, doesn't surprise me.
Given that it's already be proven that the number of extreme weather events that the world have been experiencing over the past several years would not have been possible without climate change, to me this headline is pessimistic, in that nearly 50% of people are still living in denial.
I can tell you I used to ice skate on natural ice every year and that is just gone mostly, I see the change happen in my 24 year life time.

There was no winter in southern New Jersey this year. Fall just kind of stretched into spring and there were no accumulations of snow at all. It just spit flurries a couple times whereas in years past it's been snowy enough that I own (and used) a snowblower. The change in weather from year to year is plainly obvious.
This April has seen NYC swing from low 50s to about 90. In one week. Storms are angry and leave behind strong negative pressure zones. The trees are growing w e i r d. This is the new normal, it seems.
Title makes it seem like climate change is something to believe in or not.

Climate change is a naturally occuring phenomenon that has been accelerated by human actions. It's not a matter of belief, that is happening.

The only discussion to be had is how much sooner should we have limited our impact on the environment, and this conversation is going to play out in a few decades.


EDIT: OP may or may not have done this intentionally, but I wouldn't rule out the possibility of an entity mass-posting to make people's minds up. And for a 10m karma account, I think that's a pretty fair assumption.
It is affecting “other places”, indiana just had an 80 degree day and now its snowing.
Just read a study that climate change skepticism is on the rise.. i even know personally people irl who claim it isnt going to be that bad who thinks its just an excuse for more tax. I had never heard anyone doubt climate change before.

Lets be real, were screwed, nobody significant is going forward with massive changes thatll actually save the climate.
It's amazing that the other 50% aren't convinced.  Or maybe not amazing...the coal industry, the oil industry, the car industry, etc., pour billions a year into confusing the public.
I work in a large kitchen, we serve hundreds of thousands of people every year. Every day I end up having to throw out a stupid amount of food. I'm told by management not to worry about it, because our food costs are so good so don't worry about the money.

I'm not so worried about the money, as I am that we are living on a DYING PLANET and this kind of practice is actively making things worse. Not to mention there are people starving, not just in Africe or whatever, but here, in our city, right now.
I mean, anyone who has lived in New England for the last 30 years will tell you how different the winter and fall climates are now vs 30 years ago.
I'm facilitating a virtual weekend workshop right now in "ecopsychology". I'll have to pass this on to the presenter. 

Just yesterday she was talking about how she's been doing this work for 20 years or so--when she first started, describing her job would take a few minutes. Now people get it as soon as she says it.
Speak to the millions of people who gardening for decades. They know when it is safe to plant from last frost in the spring to the first frost in the fall.

in my area, it was safe to plant tomatoes after june 1st. Now days, it is mid April or earlier. Used to have frosts in Sept. usually around the full moon. now, it might be holloween or Thanksgiving and gardens are going strong.
Definitely feeling it when our winters in canada doesn't even go past -20c anymore.
[In December of 2021 a MASSIVE fire broke out and destroyed 1,100 homes and businesses in a matter of hours.](https://www.marshallfiremap.com) It's known as the Marshall Fire. So many people lost everything in the blink of an eye. [Entire neighborhoods were burned down to their foundations, leaving nothing behind but the metal skeletons of cars and appliances.](https://imgur.com/a/AUrGNS7)

I had to evacuate my home. The fire ended up coming within half a mile of my place. I drive by the fallout every day. People are rebuilding, but it was a long process to get to that point.

So, yeah. Climate change is happening near me.
Last summer in the UK, temperatures which we should be seeing in 2040 came to us last year. 

I remember in 2011/12 when talk about steps which the government could take to prevent water shortages in 2022. None of those ideas have been implemented, and now things are only getting worse.
“Smoke season” in the PNW is now a culturally widespread accepted term. Climate change is already here.
There is no consistent evidence that perceiving climate change as psychologically distant hinders climate action, with studies reporting mixed results," write the authors, led by Dr. Anne M. van Valkengoed of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.

van Valkengoed and her colleagues collected results from public opinion polls surveying people about their views on climate change, some of which included over 100,000 people from 121 different countries. The polls showed that over 50% of participants actually believe that climate change is happening either now or in the near future and that it will impact their local areas, not just faraway places.

The team also looked at the results of several studies designed to test the relationship between psychological distance and climate action. Out of 26 reviewed studies, only nine found a positive association between psychological distance and climate action. In fact, some studies showed that viewing climate change as impacting distant places and communities made people want to take more action. The researchers also found that 25 out of 30 studies failed to prove that experimentally decreasing psychological distance increased climate action.

The pervasive misconception about the relationship between psychological distance and climate action could actually be impeding progress in mitigating climate change due to social influence, suggest the authors. For example, if people think others perceive climate change as psychologically distant and therefore aren't taking action, they might be less likely to act themselves. Also, they might think that their efforts are futile because real environmental change relies on the combined efforts of many.

Aussie here.

I lived through the 2019 bushfires. The sky was covered in smoke.
I'm just realizing how much I've fucked up not buying a house s decade ago here in the Midwest.    Everyone is moving here to escape the extremes of the coasts, plains, and south.   I'm basically priced out of hone buying even with a decent job. 

We're a little bit isolated here, but winters are becoming milder, with greater peaks and valleys of dbowfakja and temps, summers are wetter.
I can't find a place in the western United States that doesn't have the haze.   Either that or I'm going blind.
There's an annual music festival during the summer where I live, last weekend in July, 3 days long. It's cancelled this year, they couldn't afford to cover the additional health and safety requirements. That period of July has, for the past several years now, been dangerously hot.  The potential to create a mass casualty incident is just too high.
We experience it every year with the extreme weather ramping up. Used to be mild summers and snowless winters, now we get 4-5 snows (and usually a pretty big one) and summer is sweltering heat that killed people in their homes. I had never heard of 100 degree weather for most of my life and we hit over 110 in 2021
All my work is worthless in the grand scheme, but I still do it.   

I'm glad all the private jet owners have pledged to stop using them, too.
They said "believe" but they meant "understand."
I live in Oklahoma and I’m fully expecting crops here to fail in the next 20 years
California was in a drought at the beginning of the year. We've gotten so many rain storms that they say we recovered from the drought. This is probably the best thing climate change could do, but this is exactly the definition of climate change.
In my country, the summers of my childhood reached 25C and were relatively short lived. Now it gets up to 34C and 20C is already getting hit during springtime
Hurricanes have a way of making far away weather become remarkably close.
Since it actually ***is*** happening, what is alarming is that ONLY 50% "believe". Do the other 50% believe in the existence of trees?
So only a bit over 50% of surveyed people are attuned to reality while the rest live in their fairy tale land of denial. Got it.
50% is actually a lot lower than I would think. I don't know anyone who hasn't noticed the change in weather. Here (in Canada) growing up the hottest weather we would have in summer would be around 27C for a few days, very rarely hitting 30. Now, in summer, almost every day is above 25C and often hitting above 30C, and we are even hitting 40C which was unthinkable 10 years ago.
New Jersey keeps getting tornados and I'm pretty sure that wasn't a common thing 10 years ago. So yeah, it's a bit "psychologically close".
Didnt we hit like 1,4°c above preindustrial temperatures last year? Cities are already getting wiped out by extreme weather occurences. How ignorant do you have to be, to not see the consequences of climate change happening in real time?
Let’s see it’s April and should be in the middle of spring here.  Instead it’s freezing like below winter. So yes, there is climate change, everywhere. Can’t see how anyone can deny it.  Started prominently in the 90s.  Before that weather was like the story books.  In the 90s it would rain on one corner, snow next block over and sun shine brightly when you turn the corner.
Climate change was being pushed even 10 to 20 years ago but it does not sink in because the impact was minimal. It is a really a knee-jerk reaction - it is now directly felt that's why they believe it is happening. And the worse is that we might have gone past the tipping point of uncontrolled changes.
I think there’s plenty of anecdotal evidence for people to identify with climate change the longer they live to see such apparent changes over the course of their lifetime.  I know I have.

I’m among the first to discount the naysayers’ own anecdotes, opposed to the concept of global warming, whereby they cherry-pick their current driveway weather conditions as a barometer and argument against climate change in a simple-minded bid to dismiss the work of hard science, however, given the knowledge many of us have gained watching subtle changes take place, noting the increasing frequency of extremes, observing climate forecasts becoming reality while models are belatedly revised upward for being too unrealistically conservative, etc, I think in such instances of personal observation, it would be foolish to dismiss the body of evidence one can easily observe within their lifetime.  

Especially so if they are supporting that understanding with a body of knowledge from the science.
I think if we take feelings out of the equation it becomes clear that the actual reform is about getting new clean tech to the point it's cheaper than the dirty and inefficient options.

You could view climate action/reform as mostly just a push for high efficiency.

Plus let's face it we all know we catch more flies with money than feelings.

Save ppl money and/or offer new useful features and ppl can all of a sudden find the money to buy computers and smartphones.

The same model we use to push semi conductors to the world works on anything when your making big improvements every 18 months or so.

Compared to just targeting the lowest efficiency process that save the most money all other reform is ridiculously slow.

Like asking ppl to behave is mostly a waste of time compared to coming up with higher efficiency propositions that save money and lure ppl like flies.

The path of least resistance is the path of least resistance for a reason, but the reason doesn’t really matter because it’s still the path of least resistance!The path of least resistance is the path of least resistance for a reason, but the reason doesn’t really matter because it’s still the path of least resistance
I live in the Sonoran, and the seasons are so different now than they were when I was a kid. It's all different. The change is happening and it's in our backyards
Every late summer, without fail for the past several years, the Greater Seattle area has been beset by smoke from wild fires for almost a month continuously. Last year we finally had a fire that was *very* local to us (The Bolt Creek Fire if anyone's wondering) and the wind was blowing such that the smoke from that fire was directly coming into the Puget Sound area. This fire, which was declared as man-made, would continue to burn almost unimpeded for a whole month starting in September, and last october we continued to have summer temperatures, we're talking 80F in what should have been the middle of autumn. 

Seattle had the worst AQI on the planet for a large city for at least one day, and I could not open the door to my home without wanting to vomit and even using a KN-95 did little to remove the taste of smoke from every breath. When the rains finally came in the middle of october it immediately went back to healthy, but by that point we were half way into autumn, a time of year that is usually marked by a temperature no higher than 55F. Summer and early autumn have went from a time of year for me to plan vacations around to being one where I do not leave home unless I have to.

You can not convince me that 80 degrees Fahrenheit in Seattle in the first two weeks of October is not a direct result of climate change, that was the typical high during the height of summer when I was growing up. The wild fire smoke just made it even worse and it will only likely continue worse from every year from this point forward.
The place I live has always been cold AF with 6 month of winter. The past few summers we’ve had record breaking temperatures above 40C. That was unheard of when I was young and we have so many more forest fires, floods, and other natural disasters than usual in the past 5-10 years. We also don’t have spring and fall anymore. It went from 20C and sunny to -10C and snowy within a week last fall and warmed up just as quickly this spring. I don’t know how anyone can look at that and think nothing is wrong
1972 Hurricane Agnes devastated Central PA. It flooded well beyond the Hundred year flood level. My father lost his home to the storm. I was only sixteen. The idea of getting a car that summer disappeared. 

This winter a massive typhoon circulated in the Indian Ocean for over a month, a category 5+ superstorm. 

Will this be the year that another major hurricane takes out a eastern seaboard city? 

Have you thought about flood insurance?
Last year in New England the summer was so dry my entire lawn and several well-established plants just dried up and died. The winters of my youth are nonexistent. How anyone can still be doubtful while it's staring them in the face is beyond me.
When you're experiencing worsening 'once in a thousand years' events every year, you have to be willfully ignorant not to see that climate change is here
Well, I suppose that’s *some* silver lining to this whole “debate” (i.e. it’s not a debate, it’s fact). It’s unfortunate that for some folks, it takes until they ade personally experiencing the effects directly to finally acknowledge that the issue exists.
I don’t know how people don’t understand that it’s happening. There is evidence of it now. In Pittsburgh, the winter there would be snow on the ground all winter long in the late 80s/90s. Hell, we had a blizzard during Halloween one year. Now, we barely get snow and when we do it will be for a week and then it’s gone.
The people who don't believe the climate is changing either lives in a place that haven't been impacted yet, or are just not paying attention.

There are ski resorts that altered their season significantly over the past decade because it doesn't snow as much anymore, floods and tornado in areas that historically didn't have them, or land that literally turned into deserts. That's not even accounting for more subtle things like the water got a couple degrees hotter so some species of fish doesn't go back anymore, or plants that are growing differently because their season is affected.
https://Climate.gov because it is happening right now and we have data to show it
Climate change has already affected almost every human being.

From the crazy storms to the record setting heat waves to the unforseen changes in marine flora and fauna.

Psychologically close?  How about physically close?  I literally spend my entire life here.
My backyard used to be chock full of fireflies this time of year. Like a thousand camera flashes per second at a huge sporting event.

I literally can't remember the last time I saw a single firefly.
That is of course terribly depressing mainly because it means nearly 50% of people are idiots.
That’s good because they are close to climate change.

The weather has significantly change in my lifetime and I’m only 30.
Oh they believe it could happen? That's cool. I don't suppose I need to point out it has been happening.
Looking forward to palm trees at the jersey shore
Will? ~laughs in no winter and a dry spring this year~  

If you enjoy time outdoors I'm sure you're noticing it NOW.
If they don’t think we’re living with the effects of it now they are delusional
My area has changed a lot. The precipitation all falls in a three month period and then it's dry the rest of the year. It never used to be like that.
"Actually believe"

It's been getting hotter and hotter every year. There have been unusual record highs in normally cold months. Warm weather throughout the winter when it's normally cold and snowy. Little to no snow anymore. It's hard to not believe when the last 5 years in particular have seen noticable changes in the yearly weather patterns.
“Imagine how dumb half of all people are and then realize the other half are even dumber.”
I'm on the East Coast in the United States. This past winter season was the very first one my residence experienced with negligible snowfall. Literally got less than one inch the entire season. Never had to take a snow shovel out of the garage. It's a very eerie experience. Last winter season there were multiple snowfall events each for multiple inches. This year, nada.
Let's stop burning oil, gas, and coal so climate change does not get out of control.
At this point, i’m just hoping that media and governments worldwide start collectively joining scientists in the effort to fix the problem before we hit the point of guaranteeing human extinction as a result of climate change.
Would've been nice if that was the case, say, 20-30 years ago
I mean my entire neighborhood was burned down in California wildfires. In 2018 a whole town burned down to a wildfire. Just about every year there is a major one that threatens whole communities. This was never the case before. Wildfires always happened, but they rarely encroached on communities this often and didn't cover the entire sky in smoke to the point that you would believe it was an apocalypse. Also, climatologists are literally saying this is because of climate change. There is no surprise here.
“Climate change is happening” isn’t very precise or specific wording. There is always climate change
[deleted]
It's pretty mind-bogling that even then, so many people are not willing to do much about it. Like, even vote for climate-conscious candidates.
We've got a science post titled "most people feel" based on maybe ten-ish years of personal experience within a multi-million, potentially billion year model?

Sounds more like a measure of media consumption but let's spin it to our narrative.
I hope so. Then, they need information about most effective ways personally and politically to bring change, including information about who to vote for. They need information about which companies are paying for misinformation and distraction. The Koch brothers, obviously, but there are many more.
Does the study give any timeline, or attempt to chart this feeling over time, or even identify any key moments when this feeling changed?  

I'm wondering if certain events like that town in Canada burning because of record setting temperatures would have been a sudden catalyst, or if this has been a slow gradual change in people's minds.
> ~~believe~~ **acknowledge** that climate change is happening
No amount of "I told you so" will ever be satisfactory. Now we all get to die together
This reads like climate change denying, do you believe in the climate magically getting hotter?
How do you suppose thats happening? God turned up the thermostat.
*applaud*
Don't these hyperbolic anecdotes serve to take away from the actual science though?
My hometown flooded during Hurricane Ian.

In living there for 23 years, my hometown *never* flooded.
I saw fireflies in JANUARY. Right now we have many male mosquitoes, very few females have been about, I found 5 dead owls in my area in a month. I never have seen a dead owl.
This isnt in doubt. Climate change is happening now and it is impacting your local areas.
[removed]
You can use historical data to validate that the climate is changing. Average temperatures are hotter. Droughts last longer. Above average rainfalls are leading to floods. Sea levels are rising. More frequent destructive storms. Higher frequency of winter storms in regions that very rarely have winter storms. All of this is validated by historical data.
50% is still pathetically low, especially since the observable effects to local areas have already been happening for several years.
It's a wonderful way to feel virtuous and involved and not actually do anything meaningful.  Banning straws because of a turtle video does essentially nothing when China, India, Africa are barfing out more pollution than ever before, building coal power plants faster than ever, burning raw petroleum in open soil burn pits to make sellable fuel. No green new deal is dealing with anything important.  Just another cash grab.
If you don't believe climate change has been going on for at least the last 10-15 years, then you're a fool. It's either that or Revelations.
Where a person believes it or not, it is still happening.
Makes me think of the bioload of insects each year around here. I remember growing up as a kid, twice a year, the lovebugs would be so thick in the air that you had to breathe with your mouth closed or inhale them. The car bumper and windows had to be cleaned after every non-local distance driven.

Now? I don't even notice when it's lovebug season. There's the occasional lovebug here or there, but theyre outnumbered by a litany of other bugs even during the height of their seasons.
The IPCC is BS and way too conservative, it shouldn't be physically possible according to the IPCC for the oceans to be as hot as they have been the past 2 days.
I don't understand how any millenial living in the northern hemisphere you think that climate change isn't happening drastically as we speak.

I live in Southern Ontario where winter temperatures were regularly -20 to -30 in January and February when I was growing up. As a now thirty year old man, it barely ever dropped below -10 this year, even in the coldest months, we had 30 degree days and the beginning of April this year, and the scorching drought last summer was so bad the apple orchards here grew fruit barely bigger than a golf ball. 

None of this is normal and the change is the last 10 years has been so drastic and accelerated year over year that you would have to be willingly ignorant to pretend otherwise.

(temperatures are in centigrade, for all you Yankees out there)
It’s sad it’s only 50%. More people need to wake up and take action
the other 50%: "i'm blind, deaf and dumb. mom, is that you?"
It used to be April showers bring May flowers, but its the end of April here and we just had a 2-3 days snow storm.
So, an opinion poll is something that gets posted on r/science if they like the results? uh-huh, gotcha
In my 58 years, there's been plenty of changes.  But, that's normal.  The generic term "climate change" is way over used.  At what point in Earth's history did the climate NOT change???  We live in an active environment, and nature doesn't like to sit still long.
Any mildly thinking person can actively see the changes in weather patterns over the past 10 years if they just payed attention. Winters are more mild, Summers are hotter, melting icecaps/glaciers. People that don't believe in it simply don't want to.
Birb fiend here, if anybody needs a source to basically prove climate change is happening just look to birbs. Plenty of southern species have rapidly expanded their ranges northward as northern states get warmer overall (fun for me but not really a good sign).

Warming trends getting earlier means insects arrive or are active earlier in the year than they used to be. This is bad for birb species whose migrations used to sync up with the emergence of insects and haven't yet shifted, if they even will at all.

Mountain tops in the northeast that used to have trees are now losing the habitat at the very top because mountain tops are getting warmer. This is very bad for one species known as the Bicknell's Thrush which is at very real risk of extinction thanks to habitat loss.
50? What illiterate cave dwellers signed up for this research?
uh, people feel weather skin close so technically we TIIIGHT with climate chamge
Fake narrative to divide Humanity by the raging elites.
>Research showed that over 50% of participants actually believe that climate change is happening either now or in the near future   


This is a statement of fact, not belief. Climate change is happening now and is impacting just about everywhere.
