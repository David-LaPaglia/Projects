Literally extinction for so many species. Crazy how much rides on today, one single day in history.
Bro, America is filled with morons.
If Trump wins then our grandchildren will live in a barren wasteland. Kamala 2024.
This is what he plans to do to the entire country [https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-ziklag-secret-christian-charity-2024-election](https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-ziklag-secret-christian-charity-2024-election) 

And the world

The people for whom this would be a compelling argument are already voting for Kamala
Well... Here we are. üòï

I believe it. His policies wouldn‚Äôt spell doom immediately, but they‚Äôd run us over a cliff that only a mcguffin could bring us back from.
The AI-generated trump surfing illustrations really undermine the quality and legitimacy of this
Thanks America. And a special thank you to the out-of-touch Democratic Party for handing Trump the win.
Gonna laugh when Florida drowns.
bad news then
And people actually voted for extinction.
Has Muskrat convinced him to be an accelerationist?
But what if he crashes the economy and produces $10 per gallon gas?
I'm feeling so depressed cuz it looks like he's going to win ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Oops, the world is dead.
You all do realize the US has broken world records for domestic oil production under a Democratic president?????

What exactly can Trump do that would be worse? Pump the same amount??

Neither party gives a shit about the environment.
Fuck
Well guys, it was nice for a while, but I guess it's time to call it.
Nice knowing you all
Too late. Don‚Äôt look up
 NBC had a graph showing polling exit interview concerns. Completely absent on that list was any mention of the environment or climate issue.

I'm so shaken. It looks like that is the future America chose...
Too late
Humans are not smart enough
Hey can someone like‚Ä¶shoot me? Can‚Äôt believe that a lot of people in my generation voted for this dude. Like he‚Äôs possibly the worst for our future that we coulda chosen. Whatever, I guess we‚Äôll reap what we sow. 

And they‚Äôll blame the democrats when Florida sinks.
maybe hurricane season will kill the confederacy where Sherman should have during the Civil war.
Spoiler alert.¬†


We didn't. Because people didn't want a black lady and they thought electing a monster would get them cheaper groceries.


We're all gonna roast, or drown or fight over dwindling resources because of American selfishness and racism.


Welp.
Good thing he‚Äôs gonna win cuz not enough dems voted. Can‚Äôt wait for a Nazi dictatorship
Look at it this way, he will succeed in extending the Florida keys up to Georgia.
Whelp, there we go.
Trump's tards are too stupid for their own good.
Yup and we fucking deserve it. Dumb ass mother fuckers don‚Äôt care about anything other than the current price of the Big Mac.
You couldn't have gotten this message out sooner?
Hello darkness my old friend‚Ä¶
now what
Well this post is more depressing now

GG everyone humanity had a good run
We are so dead
Turns out‚Ä¶people will sell their soul for cheaper gas and a 15% discount on groceries
Well shit
Guess we're fucked. Ignorance is awesome, eh?
We deserve to be wiped out. Let another species have a shot
Welp. Planet is effed.
Many people are cool with this as long as trans people pee in the bathrooms of their birth.
We're so fucked dude
Now that the results are in and Harris has conceeded, it's probably not helpful to point out (once again) that climate change has never been more than a public relations problem for industry. Their business model is not changed in any way by the reality of climate change, nor is it likely to.¬†


That's just as true under a Harris presidency as under a Trump presidency.
Capitalism will not allow the human race to continue. We've been cooked for some time. We currently pump more oil in the US than we ever have.
Too fucking late.
We are cooked
Correction, Trump will be*
This aged well
The sad reality is that even with Kamala, action would be lagging necessity by a rather large amount. We've taken things too far, and some harsh consequences are already baked in to our collective future. Another four years of trump and his big oil/Project 2025 cronies not only failing to take further action, but dismantling the pitiful efforts made thus far means an almost certain overshoot of even the slightest chance to salvage our future. 

I am a single issue voter; Livable Planet, Viable Future. Is she the best champion of this issue? No. She still got my vote, because the agent orange alternative is just as toxic as the name implies.
Fuck it, we deserve this
Think we're pretty turboed up already.
Lying bullshit
ROTFLMMFAO
GG EZ üá∫üá∏üòÇ
Stupid fucking post, and even more ignorant comments.
Is this Babylon Bee? üòÇ
Unfortunately it's nearer than you thought. Drump won
Papa Monzano of Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle
Drill baby drill /3
They did. They don‚Äôt care.
We did dipshit
Guess we‚Äôre gonna die. This sucks.
Like we didn't break oil and gas drilling and export records under a pro-fracking Biden admin
Oops
Welp
Ok then run a campaign against him
Oops
I'll be honest. I clicked on this Wednesday evening with the intention to sort by time posted and see how much both sides bullshit I see. Wish me luck. I honestly hope I'm being too cynical.

Edit: I was not too cynical. How fucked.
Mfers act like we haven't had decades to do more. Pinning it on one person is insane. And stupid.
Well this article aged like milk, didn‚Äôt it?
China and India have entered the chat
Well at least we‚Äôve solved the Fermi paradox. Well done America.
Can I get this in a respectful answer?  What exactly can Trump do to create such a scenario to increase negative climate change effects so much so from US current effect versus what is actually happening in other counties like China and India?  

Obviously any increase is bad, but there is zero chance US can get to a climate change effect as bad as several other countries creating more emissions than most other countries combined and in a manner to create an ‚Äúextinction‚Äù level event.  

Obviously effects get compounded down the road and we aren‚Äôt going extinct soon.  I just want to see the science from such a claim to maybe see something I‚Äôm not seeing.
It's over. Done.
People have voted
Too late‚Ä¶
I mean considering the fair chancw it doesn't destroycliterally everything, in millions of years from now new species will emerge so it won't be that bad and I'm not really worried in the long run, I wasn't affected by the Great Dying or KT that much considering new life emerged
Dems wouldn‚Äôt have done anything either. btw are we making more fuel energy or less fuel energy than a time in the past. Overt indifference or lip service, same dif.
Its fine. Im ready to die.
And, this right here, is why he won.
Too bad tree huggers, he won!
This didn‚Äôt age well
Not a minute too soon. In retrospect, I probably should've voted for him myself the sooner we get this over with the better.
trump + Elon chips= mark of the beast 666 new world order
Trump don‚Äôt surf .
Stupid
I did vote accordingly I voted for Trump. Yay.
United states emissions decreased during trumps term
Environmental whackos are going to cause ‚Äúan extinction event‚Äù!üôÑü§¨
But China and India and Russia are 100x worse and they won‚Äôt stop, so how is Trump extinction level exactly?
Well, we‚Äôre fucked.
Nice
America: uh oh spagetti-oh!
Welp
