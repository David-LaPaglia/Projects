Here\u2019s a graph showing that, from NOAA no less. For all of human \u201chistory\u201d we have been used to abnormally cold temperatures. This data comes from using mass spectrometry to analyze tiny trapped bubbles of ancient atmosphere found in ice cores. No this doesn\u2019t mean climate change is fake, yes it means those idiots saying it will be doomsday are factually incorrect. As usual with over politicized subjects, the truth requires nuance and pleases neither extreme.",

            "Whether you believe in climate change or not, I dont understand why we still wouldn't pursue alternative forms of energy considering natural gas and oil is a finite resource while renewable energy is infinite. Also, why cant we get behind preserving nature and wildlife on Earth. We also take clean drinking water for granted, but thats even a stretch (\"cough flint Michigan cough\")\n\nBut I do agree climate change fear mongering is a little blown out of proportion\n\nEdit: I love all of the comments I've gotten to read. I love reading different opinions especially about a topic im very passionate about. Im an energy engineer with a masters in renewable clean energy for reference. Yet at work I mainly deal with commissioning/ retro-commissioning projects.\n\nEdit: when I say renewable is infinite, im referring to how the sun n wind is practically infinite and will never disappear. We also have hydro and geothermal which a lot of people forget about.\n\nEdit: some people are commenting about residential solar. Which when chatting with them, I didnt portay my opinion correctly when saying solar is affordable. I dont expect the average Joe to buy the panels themselves. That duty and pressure will fall on the utility companies. BUT if you truely wanted to buy a small solar system for your house you absolutely can and it is affordable. \nhttps://www.consumeraffairs.com/solar-energy/how-much-do-solar-panels-cost.html\n\nI remeber research cost in college years back thinking $20k is not terrible. On average now for a simple system, it can be $15k or less. Which can probably lower your bill in half as well as sell energy back to the grind.\n\nEdit: Look up Evansville, Indiana if you want to see the true effects of coal on human health.",
            "The problem isn't really the temperature, but the rate of temperature increase.  You can even see in that plot you posted that the rate of increase is way higher than normal. The effect will be that ecosystems will have a hard time adapting fast enough, and many plant and animal species will go extinct.  The biggest issues for people will be a change in what land can be framed and how many people can be supported in different places.  That is going to be a huge problem for the developing world.  For the US, not so much.  We'll adapt.",
            "OP this doesn't mean anything. No one is arguing that humans are causing the planet to get too warm for the planet. Global warming is simply inconvenient for us. The earth goes through cycles of ice ages and glacial periods, regardless of what we do. But by pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere we're speeding up the cycle. If we had left things alone, the polar caps could take a long time before they melted again. By doing what we're doing, we're shortening that time dramatically, perhaps by the order of 99%. \n\nHaving tens of thousands of years to prepare for stuff is one thing, having only 100-200 is quite another. \n\nAnd I hate this attitude that calling it climate change is some kind of cop-out. It's not. Climate change is a more accurate term than global warming because pumping GHG into the atmosphere isn't going to make it a lot warmer in some places. The Sahara Desert, for example, is not going to get much warmer. Some places will get a little warmer, and some will get a lot warmer. Also, rainfall patterns will change, and this is a big problem, because it will change what land is viable as agricultural land. \n\nIf anyone doubts that GHG cause global warming, I really encourage you to just start learning the science. Don't look at anything political, just learn the science. Just learn some basic physics. Learn what heat is. Learn what blackbody radiation is. Learn what light is. Learn how we get energy from the sun and how we lose it into space. \n\nGreenhouse gases are transparent to visible light but opaque to infrared light. This means that increasing them makes the earth warmer. I don't have time to spell it all out, you've got to do your own reading and learning. \n\nDoes this mean that leftwing politicians are right? No. Politics is a completely different matter, and a lot of left wing \"solutions\" to this problem are garbage. But that's another debate. As for the science, human - caused global climate change through the burning of fossil fuels is 100% true. Trying to deny that is like denying very basic physics, it's just ignorant.",
            "Hey bud, 500 million years ago the Earth was uninhabitable. \n\n\u201cThe land was barren, likely dry and rocky. Locally, there may have been microbial soil crust. There was no vegetation as we know it today - no grass, no trees, no plants. This photo shows what the land may have looked like 500 million years ago, during the Cambrian Period.\u201d\n\nFrom: https://www.ontariobeneathourfeet.com/first-life-on-land",
            "Yeah sure, Earths average temperatures has fluctuated very often, and the planet is fine, life on it just goes on...\n\n...but you might want to take this graph and put a timeline of mass extinctions on top of it. These happened at 445, 375, 252, 200, and 66 million years ago, and the 6th is happening right now. Do you notice something with these dates and the dates on your graph?\n\nThen go and look up what triggered these events. You'll find that half of them were caused by asteroid impacts or volcanic activity. 2 of them are actually attributed to general rapid change in the climate (one cooling, another warming). \"Rapid\" in this case meaning over the span of over a million years. Not the few decades the current drastic change is happening in; also note that Earth was actually cooling down and based on historic data isn't supposed to be warming up at all, that is until the industrial revolution kicked into high-gear.",
            "The same science that produced this graph is saying that we are having a major impact on our climate. Couple that with our garbage problem, we need to change how we live.",
            "i shouldn\u2019t really have to say it, but some people dont understand. this graph really doesnt tell us about our current situation. even small degrees in temperature changes can cause dramatic and severe changes to our planet that can not be undone. i urge people, who dont believe or think its not serious, to really look into the facts. even if you dont believe in climate change, we should be trying to live more sustainably especially since fossil fuels are a limited resource and eventually we have to use something else",
            "\u201cplanet\u201d cant care less about global warming, cooling, co2 and so on. \n\nEven nuclear winter. \n\nSome species will go, other species will flourish. \n\nBusiness as usual. \n\nThe only ones who we hurting by this is ourself, and we should act with our own interest in mind weighting tradeoffs.",
            "I'm struggling to see your point. Yes, earth has been a lot hotter than it is now, no one is arguing that. The problem is that the rate at which earth is warming up is extremely high. Of course, that doesn't matter to earth. But to humans and pretty much all other species on earth, such a sudden rise in temperatures will probably have massive consequences. If we partially prevent, or at least limit the amount of sudden warming, the consequences will probably be less. And there is nothing in this graph that suggests this isn't the case. So what is your point?",
            "Most of these other events weren't step changes in the climate, but slower gradual processes, where life could adapt a little more easily. The ones that were step changes (meteorite impacts, mass eruptions) had very bad consequences. \n\nThe current change the climate is experience is on the order of 100-200 years, which is a step change on the scale you plotted, and something we should be very worried about.",
            "That's a great chart! You should add the 6 mass extinction events to it to demonstrate the effects of climate change. I wonder which genus will take over the world this time?\n\nMy bets are on Blattodea. Those cockroaches can survive anything!",
            "Doesn\u2019t mean that we shouldn\u2019t try to slow it down or find a solution.",
            "There is another graph that is also relevant.\n\nSome might argue that 500M years is mostly w/o human inhabitants. So the temp cycles of the last 5M years is a better argument (with similar results). It has to do with \"Milankovitch Cycles\" that science really can't totally explain w/planetary orbitals. Some suspect earth's core and magneto-dynamics are in play too.\n\nThe WikiPedia article on [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100,000-year\\_problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100,000-year_problem)\n\nSee the chart here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch\\_cycles#/media/File:Five\\_Myr\\_Climate\\_Change.svg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles#/media/File:Five_Myr_Climate_Change.svg)\n\nThe fluctuation changes are +2\u00b0 to -8\u00b0 C. It shows we are at the peak of the current cycle and about to go into another cold cycle. So yes, even if man-made CO2 does affect the temp more than say, venting volcanos and ocean bio-mass does, we need to be prepared for global cooling by Nature.\n\nThis is one reason for the global cooling scare of the 60s-70's, which was the first attempt at using climate for justifying globalism in autocratic Socialist/Marxist style governments.",

That usually takes a few million years, but it happened in a hundred this time. That\u2019s why people strongly suspect it\u2019s human-caused. Regardless, agree that politicization of this has gone to irrational levels. We should do our best to minimize our negative environmental footprints, but in a rational way that doesn\u2019t destroy our economy.",
            "There's very little meaning to historic data with regards to how the planet will react to a very swift rise in temperatures. Life won't go extinct, and humans neither, but it's everyone's interest to lower the rate and even stop the temperature rise.\n\nBut it needs to be addressed smartly, and not by wasting billions on useless policies that won't do anything or might actually do more harm than good.",

Let alone industrial civilization.\n\nThis is a perfect example of cherry picked scale chosen to suit a narrative. If the concern is the rate of increase over 100 years, how could you begin to call this relevant information? \"Today\" looks like a vertical line straight up and is kind of the only relevant piece, and it does *not* do your point any favors.

Honestly, I was skeptical about climate change until I started doing environmental chemistry, and it's pretty obvious humans and the things we've created (fossil fuels/agriculture/ ect.) Have and continue to play a significant role in various forms of climate change. The earth has been way hotter on average for much of it's history, but it's the rate of the temperature increase that's the biggest issue, not necessarily the fact that they are happening.\n\nMy biggest concern isn't the temp but the acidification of our oceans. THAT'S going to be the real issue in THIS generations life time. Combined with micro plastics in the oceans, you've got the recipe for predator species of fish becoming extinct in the coming years. Specifically marlins. 1 in 4 of them are born as hermaphrodites (male and female sex organs) and can't reproduce properly. Once they go, the whole thing (ocean) gets thrown upside down and will have to find a new balance. The time that will take will be the problem for us. Not to mention the bleaching of coral (Australia) that's pretty bad too."

I guess it's cool to love the effects of climate change while still smugging liberal by showing off your belief that climate change writ large is real.\n\nI've decided that most people are like this: abnormally warm weather is \"nice\" and, after having experienced a couple weeks of it, anything less than that abnormally warm weather is \"cold\" and thus bad. Like, it's going to be 77 in a couple days here, and I know for a fact that the news is going to say that when it drops to the upper 50s the next day that \"the cold will return\" or something like that, even though the upper 50s are themselves what would've been considered abnormally warm a couple decades ago. \n\nOne comment on another sub I read recently said that they think no one seems to care about climate change since the pandemic. I think that's true. It's like how people are way less aghast by Trump now than 4 (let alone 8) years ago. We're kind of tired, bored, and nihilistic as a nation now.

When they say \"we could see temperatures rise by 10 degrees over the next 10 years\" they don't mean that the average temperature is going to rise by 10 degrees. They mean \"there could be 10 degrees more thermal energy in this already kinda violent weather system over the next 10 years.\"\n\nSo, it's not that it's going to keep getting hotter. It's going to get more violent. We are already seeing this in places where the weather naturally has big swings. In 2021 Texas had a record breaking cold snap that almost took down the power grid. In 2023 Texas had a record breaking summer where it was over 100 degrees from June to September.  We are also seeing tornado alley shift east. Tornado Alley used to be a line roughly from Dallas to Omaha but we are seeing that shift east as the air coming over the rockies has more energy. \n\nSo if you live in a place where it's hot in the summer and cold in the winter, expect it to get hotter in the summer and colder in the winter.  If you live in a place with storms, expect them to get worse. \n\nWhere you live, it may be 10 degrees warmer this year, but  it might be 10 degrees colder with a blizzard next year.   The real problem is not that it's a little more uncomfortable for you and me, the problem is that our civilization is dependant on stable weather patterns.  If we go 1 year without rain in the great plains then there won't be any crops to harvest and a lot of people are going to die of famine the next year. \n\nIf Florida keeps getting pounded by hurricanes like it did this year we're going to have to stop building houses there.

The amount of CO2 in the air, if we burned all the fossil fuels in existence, would be equal to the way things would be if no living organisms had ever been buried (and less than if life never formed on Earth, due to sequestration by current biomass). Since the first life on Earth was able to survive before any life sequestered CO2 underground, it can be hard for some to believe we're headed towards a doomsday scenario by burning fossil fuels. \n\nI'm sure this will get down-voted, even though it answers your questions.

The maps of what countries do vs don\u2019t believe in climate change lines up pretty well with countries that have directly experienced very high levels of climate change mostly believing (India, Mexico, coastal Mediterranean countries, most of South America) and countries that have experienced significantly less of those direct effects not believing (and then there is Russia with insanely low belief levels even though they have had major effects but they are an outlier and sometimes just like to be contrary.) \n\nInside the US, the same pattern holds: the western states, upper Midwest and east coast into New England are far more likely to believe than the lower Midwest, south, or Great Plains.  It\u2019s easy to say in the US that this is a political difference; and some of it surely is, but it\u2019s much easier to convince people that the truth is a lie when they don\u2019t see daily evidence of it.

Farmers in those areas (even though they tend to be conservative) are more likely to believe because there have been some changes and they affect the farmers in a more perceptible way (crops tend to need to be planted earlier but are at more risk of a late freeze and droughts can be longer and more severe).",

After WWII, people became skeptical that science was good, that letting scientists pursue any avenues of investigation produced good things for society.  Atomic weapons made giant bugs and fire-breathing reptiles in the movies showing the consequences of science gone wrong.\n\nMove ahead to the '60s and counterculture began to talk about how pollution was killing people and destroying the world.  Cigarette and Oil companies developed massive campaigns to deny factual information that threatened their profits.  Conspiracies about 200mpg carburetors being kept hidden by oil companies made the rounds regularly.\n\nIn the late '70s and early '80s, movements like 'Moral Majority' found cable audiences and promoted the idea that they were really the majority and should have political influence.  \n\nA decade later in the '90s, add Fox News to the mix, unusually effective since they chose to be the only cable news that was in basic cable tier.  They were more corporatist than right-wing at the time, but developed an unhealthy symbiosis with their audience to tell them what they wanted to hear and get their loyalty in return.\n\nParanoia surrounded Y2K.  The Internet was becoming something people used casually for information.  WWW, cell phones and texting started to create mass distribution channels where individuals had faux celebrity.  9/11 created so many conspiracies because it was so undeniably horrific and so unbelievable at the same time.\n\nRegarding climate change, corporate interests don't want to invest in new technologies when others will profit from them, when it eats into profitable industries like oil, coal, chemical production, etc...  So, they hire scientists and find 'news' personalities to front them enough to perpetually muddy the water.  Politicians smell the blood in the water and feed on the division.  Ther's no 'others' worse than 'other party' others.\n\nNow, imagine you are someone who is normally low information swimming in this sea of misinformation.  You've always depended on your community to tell you what's happening, what's right and wrong.  Churches are promoting politics.  The news is spewing biased misinformation.  Your new communities on the web are putting it all together in ways that tell you: It's these 'others' that cause the problems.  It's these 'others' with their sophistry and overthinking that miss the simple and obvious important truths.  Smart people are the dumb ones.  'You' listen to the right scientists and spiritual leaders.  'You' are the smart one.  Everyone you know agrees.\n\nSo, they ignore the obvious self-interest of biased news, biased religious sources, biased echo chamber communities self-congratulating about how perceptive they are.  Their trust is invested in sources that confirm they are good smart people.  It's easy and comforting and allows them to be angry at 'others'.\n\nAnyway, it's a theory.",

Or in layman\u2019s terms, it was harder to make an accurate prediction. \n\nThere were 3 main predictions based on projections of 3 main factors. Consistent rise, gradual rise and drastic reduction of CO2 levels. We \u201cfailed\u201d the consistent rise, the prediction overshooting reality by a fair margin. That\u2019s the one that gets thrown around as scientists failing. It was deliberately the worse case scenario. We also failed drastic reduction. Because we never did any drastic changes, so our temperature is higher than our predictions. Again, that was expected to be wrong. Best case scenario. \n\nBut the one we\u2019re actually close to? The one that predicted a 1.2\u00b0 increase by 2020? The one that recognised that our CO2 output would gradually rise and cause severe effects on our climate? That\u2019s the one we hit. And the deviances are literally just lack of data which when plugged in continue to accurately predict our predicament. \n\n\nThe ice age ended a little under 12,000 years ago. Data for the last 2000 years puts a temperature variation of +/- 0.2\u00b0. Direct record for the last 300 years has us actually below at an average of -0.2\u00b0. 100 years ago we jumped to 0.3\u00b0. 20 years ago we were 0.8\u00b0. Today we are 1.2\u00b0. We are making a demonstrable impact. You cannot hide from this. The longer you and others like you do the worse it gets. We need to change.",

It is not a prediction of green gentrification, but rather a study on how census tracts have gentrified over the course of several years. Using this, we are using AI to hopefully predict green gentrification, which is a very real issue. \n\nIf you are statistically literate, I encourage you to read the paper since it will perhaps clarify some misconceptions you have about how this affects people beyond mere GDP, which is a very superficial understanding of climate impact on lower socioeconomic classes.",

They found that the aliens kept dying off within just 1,000 years because their planets would always get too hot to remain habitable. Not even totally switching to renewables changed their fates: their worlds would still slowly toast themselves to death, all the same.\n\n> The work addresses the thorny problem of waste heat. Thanks to the second law of thermodynamics, a small amount of heat will always be released into the planet's atmosphere no matter what energy source we use \u2014 be it nuclear, solar, or wind \u2014 because no energy system is 100 percent efficient.\n\n> The researchers suggest that this could offer a partial solution to the Fermi paradox. \"We have not encountered technological species because they are rare at any given moment in time,\" the researchers write in the study. That's because advanced lifeforms may simply keep succumbing to climate change within a thousand years, which is practically nothing.\n\n> On the other hand, they note, this doesn't necessarily explain why we haven't seen any lingering technosignatures that potentially outlast the civilizations they originated from \u2014 a radio signal traveling for many light years, for example, or an interstellar spacecraft like our Voyager probes.\n\n---\n\n Please reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1fw5hxz/scientists_simulate_alien_civilizations_find_they/lqc45o7/",

I don't know how any waste heat humans might generate in a carbon neutral or negative economic/technological state would come close to moving the needle by comparison. Right now we consume about 648 exajoules of energy from all sources, of which about 55% ends up as waste heat which would be 356 exajoules.

They are exactly as good as the model you give them, and the data you give them.  Since we have zero data on this we have to look at the model. \n\nJust gotta wonder if there isn't a little bias in the model and assumptions. \n\nBut it's not a new concept.  Larry Niven, a SF author wrote in the 60ss of a race that was moving their entire system because of heat waste.  As they became more industrialized, they could not radiate heat at the rate they generated. ie. Global warming.",
            "This is goddamn absurd. The levels of energy use they're assuming fail basic sanity checking. What do they imagine these civilizations are doing? Commuting 10 percent of their population to the moon and back daily ?",
            "[removed]",
            "this paper means nothing. they are modeling that if exponentially keeps using more energy eventually you will heat up the planet. so they say you use 1 unit of energy in year 1, by  year 1000 you will be heating up the planet beyond what is livable. they are modeling a 1% increase per year so in year 1000 they are using 20,000 more energy than year 1. and cumulatively you used 2million units of energy. \n\nevery unchecked exponential growth model will fail any system. duh!",
            "Unrealistic assumptions lead to really dumb results? Who knew?\n\nRemember SETI? It was based on 1950s tech. Radio was high tech at the time and radio stations built ever more powerful transmitters.  That trend was assumed to continue and had it done so we would radio stations broadcasting with petawatt power...\n\nSame flaw with the Kardashev scale, some energy good so infinite energy even more good!\n\nSame with Malthus, people will over reproduce like lemmings and run out of food and other resources.\n\nReality doesn't work like that! Our technology gets more efficient over time. Our population is expected to start shrinking. So we are near peak energy consumption and switching to renewables from fossil fuels means a 60% cut in total energy use at minimum since ICE vehicles are only about 20% efficient. And we get that cut in the next decade or two.\n\nI didn't know bullshit became a science but at least these artistes note that equilibrium is a possibility leading to billion year old civilizations",
            "So... I think this is a bullshit study.  \nThey just drew a curve for energy use and followed it until the waste heat boiled the planet. If you set energy production to increase forever, then yes, surprise surprise, the waste heat is going to kill everything at some point.\n\nThe didn't assume that in 1000 years a civilization might find solutions to this problem, increase efficiency, displace energy consumption to space, stop growing, etc. They just assumed the civilization is going to build the same type of infrastructure, on the surface, forever, until they cook.\n\nBut hey, at least it checks out a bunch of clickbait boxes. Aliens, death, climate change, solar power.",

            "Sounds like a poor simulation.  \nAfter reading this garbo of a paper, I don't really know where to start, but we can start with the global warming part, if ya look at equation 4, which is a very, very, very, very simplified global heat equation, cause it makes assumptions and ignored everything else, things it ignores off the top of my head: Regional Climate Variability, Atmospheric Wind Patterns, Ocean streams, this equation would only work on a star wars-esque planet where there is only One climate. To go off that, it assumes all planetary parameters will remain constant, from greenhouse gasses, atmospheric composition, and albedo, since deliberate engineering can dramatically reduce temperatures in an area, that is take a concrete city, rip up the concrete and plant shit tons of trees, and wow temperature mysteriously drops. It also assumed that energy needs grows exponentially, without any advancements in production, efficiency, waste heat recovery, cooling technologies, and greenhouse gas removal technologies, as well as many other improvements that can be done. I mentioned it did exponential growth on energy consumption, which is Usually fine... For short time projections, since for long term it ignore shit like logistic growth, or basically every non-exponantional growth, as in growth slows down and speeds up along with available technology and resources. It also does not thing about the fact that they would probably be equally as bloodthirsty as us, so a gengis khan or two would slow the scenarios something greatly. It also focuses on trends from the effin 90s when coal was still cool, cause today we got political, economical, and environmental pressuring a transition from shitty unsustainable energy consumption. And it also assumes everything will great heat... Like wind, wind will create more heat.... It also makes assumptions based on human consumption and growth, assuming that everyone would follow the same path and the same speed, imagine if we only found copper a decade ago. It also uses the kardashev scale to categorize the consumption, but forgets why you don't use it, when there is near zero nuance, among other things.  \ntl;dr it oversimplifies every methodology and model so much so it ignores that things can change.  \nIt's using a single person worth of opinions to build your world view on.",

While it doesn't contradict the overall trend, it implies there are phenomenon we are not taking into account which can regulate planetary temperature.\n\nThe same is true of ice regrowth in places like Antarctica. \n\n**The point I'm making is if we can't even correctly map out our own ecosystem to get an appropriate measurement of the point of no return, how could we possibly simulate an alien ecosystem which likely evolved along an entirely different path and ecological relationship from our own?**\n\nThis study doesn't offer us much.",

They found that the aliens kept dying off within just 1,000 years because their planets would always get too hot to remain habitable. Not even totally switching to renewables changed their fates: their worlds would still slowly toast themselves to death, all the same.\n\n> The work addresses the thorny problem of waste heat. Thanks to the second law of thermodynamics, a small amount of heat will always be released into the planet's atmosphere no matter what energy source we use \u2014 be it nuclear, solar, or wind \u2014 because no energy system is 100 percent efficient.\n\n> The researchers suggest that this could offer a partial solution to the Fermi paradox. \"We have not encountered technological species because they are rare at any given moment in time,\" the researchers write in the study. That's because advanced lifeforms may simply keep succumbing to climate change within a thousand years, which is practically nothing.\n\n> On the other hand, they note, this doesn't necessarily explain why we haven't seen any lingering technosignatures that potentially outlast the civilizations they originated from \u2014 a radio signal traveling for many light years, for example, or an interstellar spacecraft like our Voyager probes.",

How much wealth would need to be redistributed in order to truly address climate change? How much money would be needed to overcome that resistance? Basically treat this issue like a physical problem of gas pressure. The wealth converts into PR and lobbying and political power. \n\nFor example I'd be curious how many industrial processes there are that would have to be redesigned and how much investment would be needed for research and development, building new factories and fascilities, and how much previous investments and wealth would be lost or redistributed.\n\nI suspect that it never mattered if it was anthropogenic or not, humanity on a civilization level never had the ability to make a decision to address climate change.

We  live here too. Denial is also very real, particularly with older generations and lamentable. Unfortunately, the problem is even bigger than the average person imagines. Human beings aren't capable of voluntarily lowering their standard of living, and that is what it will take. Oil companies are producing a commodity that is demanded by the people and their government. If Exxon, for example, decided to shut in all their production today, the government would be in their office demanding they open the taps immediately, because the alternative is much higher prices for fuels, plastics, fertilizers, etc. The alternative leads to major shortages of all goods and services, particularly for the poorest people who can't bear the costs but do vote (in democratic systems).\n\nIt's a very complex problem, but it's one we bear as a species, not at the company level.

About 40 cents for 1 kWh. \n( and no it does not get cheaper with time, the last 3 remaining reactors in Germany did run since the 80's and produced the most expensive electricity on the marked before they got shut down) \n\n2. It is unreliable. France had to import electricity from Germany because their rivers didn't have enough water to run their power plants.\n\n3. The already existing nuclear waste is a problem for 40.000 generations.\n\n4. Nuclear Power plants use fossil fuel, with the current consumption there is about 60 years of nuclear material left.\n\n5. Fukushima and Tschernobyl.\n\n6. Nuclear Power plants are constantly targeted by hackers and with the exponential development speed of Ai it is only a matter of time until one is having a meltdown.\n\n7. Building new plants takes alot of time which makes the technology they are based on outdated before they produce their first kWh of electricity\n\nYou want nuclear energy? then build photovoltaic plants. The sun is basically a big fusion reactor",
            "Look at other EU countries. Their charts look similar. Most European countries lowered their per capita emissions a lot between the 60\u2019s and 90\u2019s and they have extremely different energy sources.\nPart of the lower emission can also be caused by the oil crises. And obviously a change in things like heating. Coal heating was pretty common until the 50\u2019s or 60\u2019s. Another part can be the huge change of population distribution. A lot of Frances rural population moved to urban areas. Especially the Paris metro area. Living in an urban area needs significantly less energy. (E.g. for heating and transport)\n\nPretending that NE is the reason this happened is definitely too simplistic.",
            "Sure that must be the reason. And maybe you did not know, most Nuclear plants were out of service, and Germany has to export electricity to France in the Summer. Not only because of maintance issues, but also because of drought: no way to cool the plants without water.\n\nAnd you completly disregard some of the most important thinks, like our ultra-right winged AFD:  \nNuclear fission is not magic, you need fisseable material for that. Mining that is expensive and quite dirty (will be in the statistics of some other country), enriching is also not quite cheap.  \nThen of course the nuclear waste issue: Sure, do it like some other countries, and just burry it! Out of sight, of of mind. Just some problems with that: In Germany, for instance our right winged CSU wants nuclear power, but NO nuclear waste in Bavaria... Also keep in mind most of our fission material came from russia, who is paying A lot for disinformation to destabilize.\n\nNo, nuclear fission is not super mega great as some to make us belive it is. It is by no means cheap, it is fucking ridicously expensive. But, to hide the costs, often losses are simply socialized, while earnings are privatized, much like with fraking:  \nCreate a company and do your dirty shit. When you want to stop, just go bankrupt. The Taxpayer will have to pay for the decade long and ridicously costly removal of the plant and take care of the waste.\n\nBut take a look at the UK, and their new fission plant: so FUCKING expensive, you could build enough renewables for that price to create much more power without the waste!\n\nNote, Germany has already 50 % renewables in the mix in the years median, in the Summer it reachers far over 70 %. If politics did not block and were not corrupted by lobbys of ga\u00df, oil and nuclear, we could have 100 % now very easily and could have used the surplus money for electrical infrastructure and energy storage.",

            "I will say what I will always say, when people talk about nuclear energy: It\u2018s a solution, but an emergency solution. It should be as little and as temporary as possible.\n\nWhy? Because you have to trust humans. Even worse, you have to trust humans and institutions. You have to trust workers in the power plant to not make grave errors, to not be distracted or be overconfident. You trust your government and companies to not cut any corners for personal or other gains and to not cover up problems. And that for both building and maintaining the power plant over a few generations and the disposal sites over many generations. You also have to trust other government and actors like terrorist to not try to blow up your power plant and your own government and companies as well as the working people again to not have any of the faults already mentioned and keep the power plant and waste safe so it\u2018s protected against terrorists and other governments.\n\nPersonally, as much as I truly stand behind our democratic governments in the west I think most government need to be closely monitored to not fuck up building a public toilet. So let\u2018s try to fuck up building renewables as much as we can before we consider to fuck up building nuclear power plants.",

Yes, of course, nuclear power is low in CO2, but it is the most expensive way of generating electricity. For comparison: One kWh of wind energy costs 7-11ct.",

He was worried about money, the utility bill, not climate change.  It was 50 years ago.  And his parents lived through the Great Depression.  Perhaps that's what it would take to get most onboard with mitigation: a depression that turned us all far left.  Lack of demand for everything would reduce production, leading to mitigation naturally, but temporarily.

Global warming, for example, will allow for the opening of the Northwest Passage, which could become a lucrative shipping route, and allow for the exploitation of Siberia's natural resources.

As a result, they're likely to prioritize short-term gains from exploiting their natural resources, including those in Siberia and the Northwest Passage. This means that being anti-climate (postponing action) change aligns with Russia's current goals, as they seek to maximize their economic benefits in the short term, even if it means delaying climate action. By opposing climate change efforts, the GOP is inadvertently(?) supporting Russia's strategy to reap short-term rewards, despite the long-term consequences for our planet",

But after the hurricanes last year were blamed on politicians controlling the weather, and the LA fires have been blamed on DEI, fish protection, and literally anything BUT climate change, I\u2019ve lost hope. We even passed the 1.5 degree warning limit set by the Paris Agreement this year and it was barely a blip in the news.\n\nAll this to say: you should be finding ways to protect yourself now. We bought some land in Buffalo a couple years back specifically because it was in the \u201csafe zone\u201d for climate disasters, and now Buffalo is set to be one of the fastest growing areas in 2025. If you live in an area that\u2019s high-risk for fire, drought, or hurricanes, if you don\u2019t get out now, the \u201csafe\u201d areas in the northern parts of the country are going to explode in price as climate migration worsens. Avoid islands, coastlines, and places prone to drought. The Midwest is expected to become desert-like, and the southwest will run out of water. \n\nI know this is a pretty privileged take. How many people can just pack up and move? But if the last 6 months has taught us anything, it\u2019s that we\u2019ll never have a proper government response to climate change. If you can, get the hell out and get to safer ground while it\u2019s still affordable.\n\nEdit: for those asking about Midwest desertification, let me clarify. The Midwest area around the Great Lakes is part of the expected \u201csafe zone.\u201d The Midwest states that are more south and west of this area are expected to experience hotter temperatures and longer droughts. When storms do hit, more flooding is expected because drought-stricken ground doesn\u2019t absorb water very well. \n\nFor those who don\u2019t believe in climate change, bad news my friends: climate change believes in you. I sincerely hope the deniers are correct, but the people who\u2019ve devoted their lives to studying our climate are the people we should be listening to, and they say things look dire. ",

Access to water is going to be a huge factor, and I think rural people will be in much better shape there. City people depend on reservoirs and things like that, while rural folks can use rainwater catchment and private wells and whatnot. \n\nAnd what makes me far more angry is that the corporations who are causing climate change by not adapting will actually *benefit greatly* from it by selling us air filters and will buy up the entire water supply to sell back to us at rates only some of us will be able to afford. \n\nAnd Russia, who is one of the largest sources of climate disinfo, will benefit by having more arable land after Siberia and all that area warms up some. \n\nThe governments and corporations will not take care of us.

My opinion is that the current rumblings in Ukraine and Mideast are a prelude to the energy wars. But anyway, you can guarantee that all that carbon IS going into the atmosphere. But eventually it won't be used in our cars and trucks; the last drop of fuel will go un an unmanned B2 Bomber. All that polymer resin WILL be created and eventually end up in the dirt - where it doesn't rot, it simply gets smaller. \n\nWorld leaders have done literally nothing to curb the use of hydrocarbons, and why would they? To \"stop using fossil fuels\" is to completely change (some would say 'destroy') the current society and replace it with something else. Which would mean new power structures with new people in charge. There is literally no incentive for people in power to change; if doing so dethrones them anyway, why not just ride the wave until it all comes down? \n\nAs OP has noted, anywhere declared a climate refuge is a temporary one. If you're interested in hard data, check out The Limits of Growth (30 year update). This in-depth study predicted agricultural and industrial collapse starting right about now, and when they revisited it, the model held up. It's now been almost fifty years on and the model is frighteningly accurate. They modeled out four main scenarios and the nastiest one (RCP 8.5) allows for +5 to C over pre-industrial norms. That's a world with no plankton, no pollinators, nothing. You won't even be able to grow food outdoors. Guess which model the current data aligns to? Yes, the nasty one. \n\nProbably billions will die. And if you think the country that built the world's craziest military is just gonna be chill and die quietly, you got another thing coming. Some things you should think about preparing for\n\n1. How to grow food indoors, with alternative fertilizers, and hand-pollination methods. It's counter-intuitive but the primary challenge is light indoors. \n2. Communal and familial living arrangements, completely off grid, with mutual or shared power governance\n3. How to shield future generations from debt peonage, compulsory labor, and military conscription\n4. Living without technology such as running water and electricity.",

            "Anecdotally, I have noticed climate change where I live (PNW USA). I've lived here for 70 years (with occasional short term deployments to Alaska/etc.) and I feel that is long enough to note the change in climate & weather here - e.g., for a LONG time, the running joke in Oregon was about the amount of rain in western Oregon during the summer. \n\nAbout 14 years ago I moved back to Oregon from Seattle and I have noticed the dry summers - now we often go 90 days or more with no more than a trace of rain, whereas before it was a 50/50 bet as to whether July 4th weekend would be clear & sunny or rained out. There were jokes about rain in summer \"yes it is raining, but it is a warm rain\" (which BTW, it *wasn't* warm rain) and so on. \n\nIt should not be news to anybody how the western USA is now plagued with forest fires. It wasn't unheard of when I was younger, to have a forest fire here, even some large ones, but the number and size of multiple fires ***is*** unusual. Climate Change certainly has played a part in that (along with past forestry practices - which are changing).\n\nDroughts are an issue in most of the PNW, even on the west side of the Cascades (where it used to be very unusual). Another issue is water shortages - mostly due to much increased water usage (populating increase and ag usage), but also due to climate change impacting snowpack and reservoir storage.",

The Paris Agreement at COP 21 in 2015 got people excited.  I was not convinced.   When it was held in Dubai in 2023, it was clear to me that no one was going to carry through on that agreement. \n\nThe wealthy countries will stop even pretending to do anything soon.  Some already have.  I doubt the USA will remain in anything having to do with NATO.  Most countries have too many issues themselves.

The impact, such as what is happening in California and many other places, will continue.\n\nGiven that the incoming USA President is threatening other countries while California burns and the east coast is being thrashed yet again by winter storms tells me that Americans should expect no help regarding \"the weather.\"\n\nThere are areas that will benefit from climate change.

I'd argue that a lot of people have already been priced out of the better choices, and that's going to get worse. People are moving to places where property values are going to decline, and they'll be stuck. Many already are.\n\nBased on the last US election, many US people simply don't care about this issue, and now bad policies are going to get set in concrete.

It helps out wildlife as well.... probably thenmain reasons why I'm doing it.\n\nI feel like summer droughts will become the norm, so i am producing water storage off of my roof and will eventually switch to warmer climate crops when the time comes.

So we could pay for about double that capacity for 10 years for the same price as building the rail.\n\nDoes anybody think a ticket on one of these new fangled trains from LA to SF will be $50-$100 like a plane ticket is today? \n\nIf there\u2019s a lot more demand for non-auto LA to SF travel, it sure seems like a much more economical approach would be to just subsidize more airplane capacity and make the tickets like $30.

            "There is no consistent evidence that perceiving climate change as psychologically distant hinders climate action, with studies reporting mixed results,\" write the authors, led by Dr. Anne M. van Valkengoed of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.\n\nvan Valkengoed and her colleagues collected results from public opinion polls surveying people about their views on climate change, some of which included over 100,000 people from 121 different countries. The polls showed that over 50% of participants actually believe that climate change is happening either now or in the near future and that it will impact their local areas, not just faraway places.\n\nThe team also looked at the results of several studies designed to test the relationship between psychological distance and climate action. Out of 26 reviewed studies, only nine found a positive association between psychological distance and climate action. In fact, some studies showed that viewing climate change as impacting distant places and communities made people want to take more action. The researchers also found that 25 out of 30 studies failed to prove that experimentally decreasing psychological distance increased climate action.\n\nThe pervasive misconception about the relationship between psychological distance and climate action could actually be impeding progress in mitigating climate change due to social influence, suggest the authors. For example, if people think others perceive climate change as psychologically distant and therefore aren't taking action, they might be less likely to act themselves. Also, they might think that their efforts are futile because real environmental change relies on the combined efforts of many.\n\nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/04/230421112646.htm",

Thats the insurance companies and especially the re-insurance companies, those that insure the insurance companies. Munich Re, one of the or even the largest re-insurance company, stated a while ago that it is questionable to keep building in areas that are under constant danger of climate induced impacts. Certain areas will get hit over and over again and rebuilding them every time is just too expensive. The costs for climate change will cause global recession all over the place if societies don't find ways to lower their costs for climate change caused damages.

            "This already happened in Louisiana in 2021-2022 after two rough hurricanes years (Laura and Ida). All but a handful of insurance companies went bankrupt or pulled out. Louisiana has an \"insurance of last resort\" called LA Citizens which is a public insurance company that has to write a policy no matter what, but their rates are required by law to be 10% more expensive than the most expensive private policy. Since the few private companies left in Louisiana jacked up their rates, LA Citizens became mind bogglingly expensive. Some people in a $200k house are getting $10k/year insurance rates.\n\nHowever the government put in an incentive program to lure in new companies, but it is slow going. It might work though, since companies' greed is very short sighted and you can charge a lot of money here. This also happened after hurricane Katrina and the prices did recover after a few years.\n\nIt didn't have much of an effect on house prices as far as I can tell (though they did stop rising like crazy; there were also new laws to restrict AirBnBs and also the rising interest rates may have had an effect). At least in New Orleans. The high insurance rates mostly affect single house owners and renters. Companies just pass the cost into the tenants.",

Instead the Obama's bought a multimillion dollar beach front property.\"  \n\nIt's not a terrible argument. It is wrong, but until now, it at least was factual  and relatively  logical.  \nThe Obama point was  always weak. They've got lots of book deal money they can buy a depreciating asset and not even blink about it, especially if they get a decade of nice memories at the beach with their family.

The Athabasca Oilsands which are primarily found in Alberta have more oil in them than all of the world's other reserves combined by some estimates, but Alberta's reserve estimate is usually only listed as the 3rd largest because of a nearly 20 year old \"economically recoverable\" estimate which is just 10%. Current estimates based on actual operations and newer technology could be much higher.\n\nQu\u00e9bec on the other hand has vast hydrologic resources and is home to 59 hydroelectric dams. With a dozen of those producing over a gigawatt. Most of these are controlled by a single provincially owned entity (called a Crown Corporation in Canada) called Hydro Qu\u00e9bec which then sells much of that energy to the US North East.

What it showed is that the solutions to increasingly frail and unstable systems are basically lost on the ruling class.\n\nIn 1945, there was basically an understanding that if you didn't produce your own goods, protect your economy from monopolies, guarantee employment, and drastically limit the ability of banks to speculate, then your society was just as likely to collapse from within as being invaded by foreign enemies. It wasn't that these were strictly moral issues, it's that there was a deep concern among elites to prevent revolution.\n\n But this attitude of \"efficiency\" above resilience has rotted out every level of leadership in the West. Taiwan says \"no you can't have our semi conductors\" and the USA can't produce cars. China said we couldbt have masks. Now India is limiting trade on food. Which, to a nationalist in times of crisis, makes sense. But to a globalist, someone totally alien to how production works and what is necessary to survive catastrophe *on your own*, seems unruly and dangerous. How dare they stop producing our goods??!\n\nPeople are going to die, and a lot of them. Obviously emissions have to drop fast.

We may bottom out on deaths per capita, soon. But at the current trend, climate related deaths are down and declining.\n\nHowever, are the Maui fires climate related deaths? \n\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-did-maui-fire-start-cause-lahaina-hawaii-wildfire/\n\nSome are counting this as a climate change death related scenario, however. We will see. Hawaii certainly goes through dry seasons and has their fair share of hurricanes and tropical storms. Is Hurricane Dora an abnormal or statistical anomaly? Hard to say with just one data point like Dora, for that region of the Pacific Ocean. \n\nWhat we do know is weaker hurricanes are decreasing and stronger hurricanes are increasing according to this analysis:\n\nhttps://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1920849117\n\nMy interest in this is getting ahead of the risks involved with climate change and making the adaptations necessary to save the greatest number of humans lives AND industry (just because you have created evacuation or shelter programs does not mean we are succeeding at saving climate-change related deaths...if you save lives but critical infrastructure is destroyed, we can still end up with an unhealthy situation that may result in a lot of deaths, anyway (crop destruction is also a variable)).\n\nClimate change is here to stay and no matter what we do with our emissions, we have to deal with climate change. Even if all of human industry ceased to exist, climate change is still going to happen (and the damage done by humans is going to last for quite a long time). Less pollution is a great start (I also call C02 emissions \"pollution\" to drive home the point of what it really is).",

            "This is anthropogenic bs. Any advanced and intelligent species wouldn't be driven by paranoia to compete against itself using chemicals that end the world. \n\nThis is yet another justification of our own stupidity.",
            "This seems to be based on a problematic set of assumptions and an anthropocentric bias.\n\nFirst, the main issue with human-caused warming is not waste heat, but the fact that its energy source has been locked up underground for millions of years and effectively removed from the system. If we're making an argument about waste heat from systems that are inherently not perfectly efficient, we must assume that these alien civilizations are also using supplementary energy sources. Pretty big assumption that other planets would also have the correct conditions to create fossil fuels, and create them in adequate quantities to be a substantial factor, and then that intelligent aliens on these planets happen to discover these reserves, and that they learn to and choose to use them as fuel. On the other hand, if they developed industrialization on an alternate energy source, such as harvesting solar energy directly or maybe even from some form of bioengineering to collect energy from photosynthesis, there would be no \"waste heat\" to speak of. You collect energy that's already in or entering the system naturally, the waste heat adds nothing to the equation.\n\nSecond, putting a year target on how soon these civilizations collapse themselves makes a ton of assumptions that are very biased. First and foremost, is the assumption that they consume at the same rate as us, and that they grow their population at the same rate as us. We identified this warning problem early enough to curb it, we just chose not to. Who's to assume that other intelligent civilizations are as self-destructive and short sights as we are? Maybe they choose to limit their consumption and limit their growth for self-preservation. It also assumes that they have similar lifespans and reproductive rates as us. A species that lives for ~1000 years instead of ~100 may have a psychology that's more focused on long term consequences. Likewise, if their lifecycle was proportionate and they produced 2-3 offspring around age 250, they would likely not grow their population at a pace that would collapse their civilization in 1000 years. It's not biologically impossible, we know there are complex organisms on earth that live for multiple centuries. Environmental conditions can influence lifespans and metabolisms, but physical processes should be the same everywhere. Maybe we're the outlier, maybe we are consuming ourselves to death because we naturally mature and reproduce at a rate that's unsustainable. Maybe that's why we don't see evidence of other intelligent civilizations too. If species that live 10x as long and mature at a proportionally slower rate are more suited for sustainability from a physical aspect, we may just be early to the party and will probably be long dead when \"peak civilization\" in the galaxy occurs. \n\nBasically I don't think this study is worth much. Its presumptions are only really valid on Earth, at least as far as our knowledge of other planets currently extends. And we have no other examples of independent life to base any other projections on.",

In a continued progression, we would exceed the total solar power incident on Earth in just over 400 years, the entire output of the Sun in all directions 1,300 years from now, and that of all 100 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy 1,100 years after that.

It only lasts as long as there are a handful of people. It's easy to call the people throwing soup on paintings insane radicals because there's only a few of them at a time. It's a lot harder to call groups of hundreds, thousands, or millions of people insane. They still try it, but 1.5 million people across the country getting out to protest police brutality turns heads. It attracts more people who agree. Eventually the numbers get so overwhelming that the establishment has no choice but to comply. Do you think George Floyd would have gotten justice without the protests? No, never.

Doing that would either liquidate it or else hand the reins to someone else. They're doing neither, because that would eliminate their control over the operation, which is exactly what they don't want.\n\nWhat just happened is more like an irrevocable promise to keep doing what they've already been doing, but on a larger scale and with protections in place as family members start dying.",

            "When I was studying abroad for a semester at the Universidad de las Americas Puebla located near Cholula, Puebla, Mexico I took a cultural anthropology course. The professor told us one day that he had heard from locals in Puebla that they stole the rain from the neighboring state of Tlaxcala. He made some initial questions, got nowhere, and let the topic rest. A few years later while he was in Tlaxcala, he heard people complaining that Puebla was stealing their rain. That perked his ears up so he investigated the topic again. Eventually, he met a curandero who explained to him that in the spring he and some others would go to the mountain chain that separates Puebla and Tlaxcala and burn all the vegetation that was growing. This created a blackened surface which absorbed the sun's heat and released it at night displacing the cooler, wetter mountain air towards Puebla. This professor asked to be taken to the mountains and while walking around noticed broken pottery. Even though he was a cultural anthropologist, he recognized that the multitude of artifacts on the slopes were pre-Columbian and that people had been \"stealing\" rain for centuries.\n\nSo, yeah, I would say the Aztecs and other Central Mexican groups are smarter than Walsh.\n\nShoutout to Timothy Knab, the cultural anthropology professor at UDLAP.

Right now, if energy sources such as coal and oil are to be relied on then everyone can agree they are non-renewable. And when a finite and valuable resource diminishes in supply it becomes increasingly unaffordable.\n\nSo for that reason alone we need to technologically advance from a bad thing to a better thing.\n\nI recently saw a climate change denier post on Facebook a video of a billionaire saying it\u2019s all bullshit because coastal properties are very expensive and are often mortgaged and no bank would lend on a risky property because that property is the asset on which their loan is secured.\n\nAnd if you listen only to his argument, it seems like a strong argument. Except\u2026 it\u2019s a requirement of a mortgage to insure the property and building insurance companies factor in flooding risks which increases the premiums of such policies. It also guarantees the aforementioned asset on which the loan is secured is also secured by insurance. The banks don\u2019t care if the $7m house falls into the sea, it\u2019s not only covered by an insurance policy, it\u2019s covered by an insurance policy they didn\u2019t even have to pay for.",

In Al Jaber\u2019s view, the success of COP28, not to mention the broader efforts to fight climate change, hinges as much on embracing the private sector and shifting market conditions as it does on wonky negotiations.\n\n\nprivate business got us into this mess, if the free market could solve it, it would be solved already. There are no regulations saying the free market isnt allowed to solve AGW.\n\nMind you also this idea is also like saying, why have taxes? lets just run the gov on voluntary donations. People who care. itll be fine. Or worse, this is like playing poker with a friend and you hate wild cards, think they mess up the game, and he says fine you dont have to use them, but he still gets to say 3 are wild but only for his hand, because you are a good guy and are choosing to ignore wild cards... you are going to lose all your money. it has to be the same game for everyone.\n\nThe reason why you CAN NOT count on the private market is competition. If one business can make more money saying fuck the planet than another business, thats what they will do. and sorry i cant vote with my feet on things like refineries.\n\nthats why you need gov to set rules to make sure all companies play on a level playing field.\n\nCapitalism produces wonderful things, and yeah it has flaws  but has been our best system to date at human advancement, but the things that make capitalism great for inventing things, makes it horrible for solving global problems. Competition.  sans regulation, of course any solution will use private business up the wazzooo.. solar farms arent building themselves. But without regs we will fly by all temp targets.
