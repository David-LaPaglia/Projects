Posting again to get eyes - I‚Äôm drawing houses lost in the fires. I‚Äôm also drawing houses that weren‚Äôt lost and all the money will go towards helping two families close to me that lost everything.,Drawing houses has been a way for me to process this grief and I would love to honor the homes and stories lost. If you didn‚Äôt lose your home but still want it drawn I will be donating the money to two close friends/families of mine that lost everything in the Eaton fire. It‚Äôs a small thing I can do to feel like I‚Äôm helping since I‚Äôm a broke artist and still evacuated. ,2569,2025-01-23 19:10:46

Erewhon is a joke ,"Many small businesses, operating on a fraction of Erewhon‚Äôs budget, are generously providing free meals to first responders, while Erewhon has the nerve to announce a mere $20 discount on orders over $20.

I thought this was so beautiful about how us Angelenos need to ignore the outside noise about our city ,"[Jan 11, 9:21pm]

Like many of you, tired of all the people from other states, mostly the red states, coming in to our sub this week to ask politically inflamed questions and laughing at us from behind their keyboards. That we deserve it for the way we vote or because of our supposedly Hollywood/elite culture. They don‚Äôt know us. They don‚Äôt know our true culture of love, empathy, courage, and resilience. I saw this on Instagram from a creative, Cristina Black, and I had to share it. 

I‚Äôve been getting so annoyed with the outside noise but this post was a good reminder to let it be. That we know our city best. We will pick each other up and we will fight for each other. FUCK the outside noise. 

LOS ANGELES FOREVER. LA LOVE.

Is anyone else feeling pandemic- like feelings all over again?,"I just need a place to vent, and I‚Äôm not even sure if this is making sense. It feels like 2020 all over again. I‚Äôm finding myself so frustrated with the lack of ‚Äúreading the room‚Äù from some people‚Äîlike seeing people washing their cars or just carrying on as if life is completely normal.

On one hand, I get it‚Äîif you weren‚Äôt directly impacted, you still have to work, eat, and live. But I‚Äôm at the gym right now, and I can‚Äôt shake this guilt. Like, how are we all just here, acting like this is fine? (Though I‚Äôve convinced myself that taking care of my mental health is important right now.)

Then there are the people in this subreddit asking things like, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the best WiFi provider in LA?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy hasn‚Äôt my trash been picked up?‚Äù and I‚Äôm sitting here like, umm hellooo?? It's so hard for me to focus on anything because my mind is just stuck on the people who are being impacted.

And this is coming from someone who isn‚Äôt directly affected‚Äîbut I‚Äôm 1) close in proximity, 2) have close friends and community who are going through it right now, and 3) have a partner on the frontlines helping with evacuations and dealing with looters (which is insane‚Äîhow are people even taking advantage at a time like this?!) 

I‚Äôm doomscrolling, getting frustrated with the lack of empathy, but also trying to remind myself that people don‚Äôt know what they don‚Äôt know. Still, it feels like 2020 again, listening to selfish people argue about masks, completely detached from the reality of what‚Äôs happening.

What‚Äôs really crazy is that I still have to work through all of this. The lack of empathy from employers is so frustrating‚Äîit feels like we should all be given at least a week to process because this is just a lot. I‚Äôm also in my PhD program, and it‚Äôs nearly impossible to focus right now. The lack of understanding is just wild‚Äîhow can anyone expect us to function? I just wish I could do more, but I feel so stuck.

Is it just me? I feel like I‚Äôm living in this alternate place where life is happening around me, but I can‚Äôt focus because it‚Äôs not okay‚Ä¶

Thank you all for being my outlet. I‚Äôve decided to channel my frustrations into something productive‚ÄîI‚Äôll be volunteering tomorrow and taking full advantage of that Google sheet of opportunities. I also serve in the kids‚Äô ministry at church, and I‚Äôve decided to have the kids make cards for those impacted. I‚Äôm going to try to turn all this frustration into action and do whatever I can to make a difference üôèüèΩ",2533,2025-01-12 05:14:49
"Jan 11, 5:30pm , I just found this in my backyard over 8 miles from nearest fire ","The last few days have been spent collecting donations, watching local news coverage, and generally staying inside. I finally got out to take a look around our yard and assess the wind damage. There's a lot, but honestly it's nothing in comparison to the real tragedies so many are experiencing. In my inspection amongst the branches, shingles, plaster, and ashes, I found this burned letter. I live near where the 5 & 2 meet, and the closest fire is like 8-10 miles from us as the crow flies. It's a letter to JPL employees to commemorate the launch of the Deep Impact mission from Charles Elachi. The power of heat and wind is incredible! Of course, yes, I'm assuming this came from that area and didn't originate closer, but it's a pretty safe assumption that's where it came from. Unreal.

Letter from a NorCal Fire Victim,"I shared this same post during the Maui fires, but the experience still stands. This is for all the folks impacted by great loss from these fires. 

It sucks, just plain does. I lost my home and my grandparents home in the 2017 Tubbs fire. It‚Äôs okay to feel how you feel and react how you‚Äôre going to react. Everyone copes and deals with it differently, some go full practical mode right away and start diving into insurance claims, others mourn the loss more visibly, I found myself going through my old photos of my home a for a while just to look at the little details (worn down kitchen cabinets we needed to replace, the little nicks on the fridge that never scrubbed out, etc). 

Sometimes you‚Äôll catch yourself replaying the sounds of your home in your head (the sound of the front door closing, maybe the hum of your oven fan), just wanting to be back home 1 week earlier. It‚Äôs comforting and totally normal. 

Folks will tell you that ‚Äúit‚Äôs just things, it‚Äôs all replaceable‚Äù. It‚Äôs the memories of it being _your_ things that were special to you that makes it hard. It‚Äôs okay to be frustrated with people when they say that, but just know they‚Äôre trying to console someone who‚Äôs gone through a terrible loss. 

The smell of smoke will be triggering for quite some time. I had trouble myself going to social events that were fire related for a while (beach bonfire, camping, etc). If you were lucky and got your car, if you have one, out of the fire, make sure you swap out your air filter a lot. The air that‚Äôs burning is super toxic, it has stuff like burned electronics from homes and other items that fill the air with stuff that‚Äôs not safe to breathe. Swapping out the filter will also help with the smokey smell in the car a little. 

When the time comes and your ready to do it, take your time sifting through your home. You may find small mugs or ceramics that survived. We were lucky and collected a few sentimental cups and things. Don‚Äôt beat yourself down though if you don‚Äôt find anything too. And again, everyone copes different through this process too. Some folks can‚Äôt bare to do it, others find it oddly comforting. I know I did. 

And one last thing, you‚Äôre now part of a community who, while has gone through something really horrific and wished upon no one, will always be there for each other. If anyone reading this wants to just chat and talk through it, feel free to IM me. There‚Äôs so much more than what‚Äôs in this post to chat about and my inbox is always open. It‚Äôs an inflection point in a survivors life and we‚Äôre all here to support each other through it. Big hug from one survivor to another. ",2460,2025-01-09 03:02:19

"I‚Äôm losing my mind. 4 dogs are living in dog prison, behind my house in Boyle Heights. I need help. ","These 2 pitbulls are chained, and the 2 bulldogs are in a metal crate. As of this month, they now live here, behind my house. Since the big dogs can and did jump over neighbors fences, the cops were called. So as of Thanksgiving, this is where all 4 stay. In this crevice. In that crate. The sun beats down on them during the day, it‚Äôs cold at night, they have no escape, no shade, no shelter. No bedding. Just dog food bowls and water. All they can do is stare at these cement prison walls. ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT. It does not change. 


I walk up to all 4 of them and they just look up at me. They don‚Äôt even bark. They have nothing to do. No enrichment. Nothing to even LOOK at. They are unable to MOVE more than their short chains, or outside of that crate. 

**Things I‚Äôve done:**

- Told landlord that the back house people have these dogs in inhumane conditions. Sent pictures.

- Told the guy (there‚Äôs a guy, his wife, and their toddler), that I hate seeing them stuck back there, he said he has to keep them there because they jump fences. He says he‚Äôs babysitting the pitbull but he told us *3 weeks ago* that it was only for a week. *Today* I saw him and his buddy carrying 3 giant bags of dog food in. 

- told the guy that I could shut my dogs inside and he can let them loose, that I don‚Äôt care if they want to jump into my yard for a little while. He says they can‚Äôt because they also jump over the others neighbors fence and she has little dogs.

- asked if I could take them for a walk. He said no.

I‚Äôm unable to be at peace in my own home, now. I‚Äôm just full of worry and anger and sadness. These poor babies. If there is one thing I will do anything to not face, it‚Äôs animal cruelty. I can‚Äôt handle it. I know it exists and I can‚Äôt go there, mentally. Now it‚Äôs being shoved in my face. 

Please direct me somewhere, tell me what I can do.

The Good Angelenos are Still Out There‚Ä¶,"I recently accepted a position in Santa Monica and I‚Äôve been commuting every day on the metro until I can find a place out there. 


Today, while getting off the train in Pasadena, I guess my phone fell out of my pocket when I got up. 

I realized it once I was off the train, but all I could do was watch it speed away from me on the last place you‚Äôd want to lose your phone. 

I ran home (literally) and whipped out my laptop and started calling it. On the second call I heard, ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

A young man named Daniel had found it on the train and he ‚Äúknew I‚Äôd never get it back if he left it there.‚Äù He was still at the train station in Monrovia. He waited twenty minutes for me to get there and refused to take any money. I insisted on doing *something* for him and he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 24. What advice would you have for me.‚Äù 

I sat there and told him what I would do differently if I was his age. Daniel, if you‚Äôre out there: you‚Äôre an angel. I hope life has really good things in store for you. ",2530,2024-09-07 04:55:18

Building more housing increases supply, which in turn leads to lower housing prices.  At the same time, investing in mental health infrastructure and drug rehab infrastructure allows many people to take the first steps in getting off the streets.

At the same time however, by not building more housing, not only are we putting recovered addicts at risk of being back out on the streets, but we are also putting more people at risk of becoming homeless.

Literally 30 seconds after we got to the spot on the hill we witnessed a drive by shooting like less than 50 feet away.

Obviously we're in danger being that close, so we ran back and called 911. we tell them what happened and they say ""Ok. we MIGHT send someone."" WHAT? MIGHT SEND SOMEONE? SOMEONE JUST GOT SHOT AT! and then they fucking hang up. We called again and demanded they send someone and they finally sent a car to us. 

The car gets here. The cops looked more scared than we were. They asked what color the car was and where it went. We pointed to the left then they're like ""ok thank u"" and THEY GO THE OPPOSITE WAY AND LEAVE. WTF!

A quick scientific readme.txt for all you East Coasters & Midwesterners checking our sub...,"Ok, ok, we get it. *""Are you serious!? 6"" of rain and California declares a State of Emergency! Talk about sunny weather entitlement snowflakes, emmeright? Hahahaha. Look at all the wrecked cars!! La-La Landers have never seen real weather!""*

Let's talk about the science of what's going on right now.

**A Visual Model**

Build a series of 4' tall mounds out of sand in the shape of the letter ""C""  a few feet away from the bank of a pond. The pond is the Ocean, the mounds of sand are our mountains, and we all live in the giant bowl between the two (""The Los Angeles Basin"")

Add a garden sprinkler. Ok, neat! You get little rivers forming and little mudslides in the mountains of sand... the land shifts around as the water makes its way to the pond.

Now add 10 more sprinklers, all at once, before any deep channel rivers have had a chance to form. What do you get? overnight formations of new rivers and flooding! So, so, so much flooding.

But we have a secret weapon! Now, imagine that you've dug some trenches between the sand mounds and the pond, and installed rain gutters. The water flowing from the gazillion channels in the mountains now has a place to quickly collect and flow into the ocean.

That's the LA River... but it's limits are being tested.

**The LA River is the steepest river in America.**

You read the correctly. From origin to ocean, it changes elevation more than the Mississippi river over her entire 2,000 mile stretch. When water surges like it's doing right now, the LA River's flow (mass of water times speed of water) surpasses that of the Mississippi and the Colorado combined. It will kill you & destroy your home. Homes here aren't built to withstand flood waters because the LA River keeps those in check (unless you have a freak storm).

**Without the concrete LA River channels, Long Beach would be an island right now.**

Periodic heavy storms like this one... with as ""little"" as 5"" of rainfall in 24 hours... send enough water rushing into the LA Basin to flood more than half of it. Think ""Hurricane Katrina"" levels of destruction. The last time this happened was in 1914 and it prompted the construction of the LA River.

**Building the LA River was such a massive project, that only the Military could do it.**

Second only to The Panama Canal, The LA River is one of the largest infrastructure projects ever completed by the US Army Corps of Engineers.

**5.88"" of Rain (in 24 hours, measured in Downtown LA) Killed 87 People in 1938.**

The storm surge was enough to overwhelm the LA River, burst a bunch of dams, destroy hundreds of homes and businesses, and resulted in a major political scandal that ousted our mayor at the time. This was our ""Hurricane Katrina.""

At present, this current storm is clocking in at **5.96"" (in 24 hours, measured in Downtown LA)**

**Our roads and cars aren't built for this, nor should they be.**

While we're ranked #9 in time-wasted-due-to-traffic (Chicago is #1), LA nevertheless has the third highest rate of ""car density"" in the country. Combine that with our weather (""75% of the time it's 75 degrees and dry""), and you got a gazillion cars shedding all kinds of oil, fluids, rubber, and particulate matter, onto the roads at any given time. When it rains hard, all that gunk rises to the surface.

The reason why you're seeing all kinds of car carnage right now is not because Los Angelino's are any worse at driving than drivers in other cities, it's because the ultra-wet roads we see every decade or so  are a near-equivalent to the ""Black Ice"" you see every winter! Your car with it's snow tires could handle our roads just fine. For us, slapping on snow-tires every rainy season in the off-chance an atmospheric river comes are way is just not economically feasible.

**Los Angeles is the 2nd largest Metropolitan Area in the World.**

Tokyo, Japan, is number one. The LA Metro Area is home to about 20 million people that are directly affected by this current emergency.

**This shit matters to you because we feed the world and make things fly.**

California is the BREAD BASKET of America, without question. We produce over half of all fruits and vegetables grown in America, and are the world's 5th largest supplier of food. Our agricultural alone contributes $44 Billion to national GDP. Flood rains fuck with that.

Additionally, California is the global nexus of the aerospace industry, with over $60 Billion contributed to National GDP, and 9% of all global aerospace industry activities. 30% of all NASA employees are  located in California! (the runner up is Texas at 17.5%). Flood rain fucks with that.

And, I dunno, Keanu Reeves lives here... I guess?

"Was told I wouldn't like LA, but I liked LA. Y'all got a nice city.","Coming from Texas you hear all sorts of shit about LA and California in general.  I tend to be more left leaning so took it with a grain of salt but ya never know.  

Well finally got a chance to go out there and must say, it was very nice!  Either I just had a very good experience or people are straight talking out their ass.  But granted I was only there Friday through Monday so not a huge time frame. 

1)  The homeless problem doesn't seem quite that bad?  No worse than Dallas in the downtown area.  Granted I did briefly drive through Skid Row and that place did look like a hellscape, but the rest of the city seemed no worse than Denver, Dallas, Houston, Chicago, or any other large city I've been to.  They all have their own set of problems (especially Denver).  

2)  The Griffith Observatory and the view was immaculate.  Holy crap, that place was awesome.  I'd love to catch a sunset up there some day.  

3)  The Huntington!  What can I say but holy shit!  What an awesome place.  Didn't get to see the whole thing (damn invasive snails!) but got to see the corpse flower which should be blooming any day now I reckon.  The Asian gardens were *chef's kiss*

4)  Downtown:  not bad!  Was told to avoid it completely and had considered doing so but went on the suggestion of some people here and was glad I did.  

* Got to see and ride the Angel's Flight which I honestly didn't know was real, had only seen it in the new Perry Mason show.  Then caught a random concert at the top there where there's an amphitheater. 
*  Went to the Broad.  Did not have time to go to the Contemporary Art Musteum across the way unfortunately but next time.  
* Checked out The Last Bookstore which was neat.  
* Went to the Grand Central Market which was hella awesome.  Wish we had somewhere like that here.   Then across the street the Bradbury is simply stunning.  
*  Didn't really feel unsafe just walking around and going about the place.  

5) The Queen Mary was *awesome*.  We'll probably stay there next time.  Did the tour but no ghosts were seen.  Who knew. 

6)  Natural History Museum was so great, especially the Pavilion area.  The Science Museum next door was ehhh.  Bit of a let down, really.  Seemed more geared towards kids but did get to see Endeavor and am very interested to see the finished display when they right it with the SRBs and fuel tank.  The aviation museum they have in the works seems really cool too AND the Blackbird just casually sitting there right in front was dope!

7)  Phillipe the Original was cool from a historical standpoint.  The actual product was kinda mid though. But plenty of free parking so that was nice. 

Think that's about it as to what I got to do.  Not much really, just didn't have a whole lot of time.  Missed out on a handful of stops like Little Tokyo, Koreatown, driving Sunset Blvd. to the ocean like recommended.  Didn't see any of Hollywood (was just going to drive through it anyhow).  Didn't get to see The Getty nor the Villa, just didn't have time.  No whale watching.  

**Cons:** 

1) Did not see near as many 'this product is known to the state of California' warnings as I was promised.  

2)  Y'alls traffic is truly insane.  The drivers are pretty good on an individual level but seriously why does it take 2 hours to drive from downtown to Anaheim in the evening?  Stop and go traffic the entire way and then when it finally clears up, there's nothing there to have caused the problem!  I guess it got cleared up hours ago.  Dallas drivers are much more aggressive but at least our traffic jams tend to only delay for 30 minutes or so.  

*  Speaking of traffic:  do people truly never hop those double white and black lines into the HOV lane?  I didn't once see it done, even in heavy traffic.  Here in Dallas people literally just run over barricades to get into the HOV lane at the slightest slow downs. 

3)  Got hurridrizzled out of Disneyland so we'll be going back in December sometime for that so I'll have to hit up the rest of the list then and add to it in the mean time.  

And man that weather, beyond the one day of hurricane/tropical storm fallout, was immaculate.  Such a reprieve from the 110 degree heat.",2103,2023-08-27 16:42:00
I love this place. Everyday feels like a dream.,"Hello!

I was born in Mexico and my family took us to USA, specifically Texas (sorry for being a transplant) when I was 4 and a half. 

Given my immigrational status, I‚Äôm not a citizen nor a resident even to this day. I‚Äôm what is called a Dreamer if the law would pass but thanks to Obama (no sarcasm) kids like me who aren‚Äôt given the best hand at life was given an opportunity to a social security number, and that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs also temporary visa that allows me to legally work and that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve needed to live my dream.

I got my bachelors in Microbiology from UT Austin (without debt) and got my first career type job at $15 an hour (still in Texas).
Moved to Florida doing scientific research for $17 which was bumped up to $24. This still didn‚Äôt satisfy me fully, I needed more in my life.

Ended up in UCLA making $27 and moved where I am at now working for a biotech CAR T-Cell company helping curing specific blood cancers at a salary + benefits that put me over 100k a year. 

I met my lifelong partner here in LA and we‚Äôre splitting a studio, with a beach view, of the Venice skate park where I bike to and from work around 11miles a day. 

Never in my life could even imagine I‚Äôd get this far in my life before 30. As an illegal immigrant without aspirations or financial help at 16 years old, a decade and change later, I feel I‚Äôve lived 3 lifetimes. And the best part is, I don‚Äôt seem to stop improving who I am. 

This city has a lot of extravagant highs and dreadful lows. Seeing rock bottom people tenting next to a Lamborghini, I‚Äôm always reminded of where I came from and where I want to be. Every city has its problems but the amount of opportunity here seems to be never ending.

I sometimes get mistaken for a native and it‚Äôs one of the biggest compliments I‚Äôve received. Perhaps my Hispanic heritage and laid back attitude but I‚Äôm glad to blend in. 

I couldn‚Äôt be happier with my life, man. I love you all and hope everyone can have their moments of bliss.",2166,2023-08-25 22:30:54

My friend was freaking out last night that he couldn‚Äôt survive in LA on a 900k annual salary.,"My friend came over last night for drinks and chit chat and we had a real sad moment in our drunken stupor. He is 29, single, and works in investment banking making approximately $50k a month in take home pay.

Now 900k sounds awesome as a single male salary, right? Apparently not in LA.

His mortgage is about $30k a month for a damn mansion in Brentwood (including his monthly landscaping of $2,500). I repeat, a damn mansion and not even in Beverly Hills. That is more than half his salary kissed good bye every month. On top of this he has two Mercedes he has been paying off and other bills (pool heating, lakers season tickets, etc) that equates to roughly $10k a month. He is budget conscious and for him, living in a mansion was his goal and serves as a reminder to keep working hard.

He is then left with approximately $10k for food, entertainment and savings. He tries to save $5,000 of that a month. However $5,000 a month doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôll be enough if he loses a job or if there is a medical emergency.

He became quite upset that even though he can barely keep up with just covering his living essentials, he cannot afford to date anybody while saving for a second home, multiple sugar babies, or buying twitter. As I understand, most ""influencer"" females in LA demand a certain standard of living from their future spouses. This may not apply to all LA women but he is rich with a preference of dating gold diggers, so the guy taking care of the women financially during marriage seems to be a thing.

As a result, he has been feeling lonely, depressed and like a loser.

What sort of advice would you guys give to my friend? Is he doomed to stay single due to financial reasons when he is making $900k a year?",2048,2023-07-16 18:46:07

Riding the Metro this weekend and seeing the new stations gave me hope of how much better LA could be. It was an amazing experience.,"The new Downtown stations are absolutely beautiful, convenient and so close to a bunch of things to do. There were no homeless, just people excited and curious about the new regional connector. My favorite stop is Grand Av Arts/Bunker Hill. It's super nice and it's literally only a couple of steps via a bridge that takes you The Broad's entrance.

I went from Palms to Pasadena, Little Tokyo, Arts District, Chinatown, Boyle Heights... all by walking and super chill rides. Even if you don't ride the Metro, it's important to emphasize how much of a big deal this project is. When you take into account all the projects that are also coming (LAX station, Purple line extension to Century City/Beverly Hills) we'll be closer and closer to having a respectable transit system that future generations will take fully advantage of. Of course, some issues that we all know about need to be addressed, but we can't stop taking these steps either.

If you've never taken the Metro, I encourage you to try it for yourself. You might end up experiencing LA in an entire new way and there will be no going back after that.",2052,2023-06-18 22:30:08

WARNING: Look into people's post history before sending gift cards or money.,"What's up guys! About an hour ago I read a thread on here posted by a guy who said his birthday is this Friday and asked for recommendations on where to eat on a $20-30 budget. That thread was 2 days ago, but he made another thread today thanking people for the suggestions and again reminded everyone he'll be spending his birthday alone. Quite a few people pitched in that thread and I saw that 1 lady even gave him a gift card to a sushi place in LA. I thought that was really nice of her. I was actually going to message the OP and ask him if he wanted some company for that sushi dinner since he seemed pretty bummed out about eating alone and not being able to afford a nice dinner. So I looked into his post history, and quickly changed my mind. I found 3 posts he made in the last 2 years where he said his birthday was April 19th, May 17th and May 22nd. He also said his credit cards are maxed out in his birthday dinner post, but he buys and resells sporting event tickets, sport jerseys and even tickets to Wrestlemania about 2 weeks ago. Wrestlemania tickets are incredibly expensive. Also, surprise, surprise, his recent birthday posts are all deleted after me and 1 other person called him out on his different birthday dates.",2310,2023-04-12 22:32:42

European who is visiting LA and USA for the first time... I'm shocked and I really need to vent.,"I'm visiting LA (and the USA in general) for the first time, as I'm attending a scientific conference this week. Honestly? I'm shocked. I did not expect this.  Let me start with some positive things. Americans are remarkably friendly. Many people go out of their way for you and try to help you out if you need help with something. I've already had numerous of kind, warm conversations that felt very honest. Many young people are progressive, want a better world and are doing volunteering work for the community. And it is awesome that interesting musea like the museum for contemporary art and The Broad can be visited for free. There is not a single reason for art to be inaccessible for underprivileged, and LA gets that. The Last Bookstore is great and the food is extraordinary. I really enjoyed the Central Market Square. Definitely hit me up with more tips, I'm sure there is a lot of great stuff to do.

But it's not all positive. Not at all. My hotel is in Downtown LA (the Intercontinental). I cannot count the people with psychosis that I've seen the last couple of days. Talking with themselves in the mirror, being very unpredictable in behavior. Drunk and high people. So many homeless and poor people. Five, six tents under each bridge. Two cops were touching a guy with their feet to see if he was dead or just sleeping. Trash, feces and piss everywhere. I thought it was a good idea to take the metro to Santa Monica and return with the last one, so I wouldn't have to take the car. But in the metro, several people were looking at me like they were assessing if they could rob me. Women were harassed verbally and looked with glassy eyes in order not to provoke anyone. I've never felt this unsafe in my life, although I'm 26 and I've visited over 30 countries of which many were low- or middle income countries. I'm not sure if it is a good idea to wander alone through the streets of Downtown LA at night.

Meanwhile, the streets are full of +100k$ cars. I cannot grasp the staggering inequality in this country and how racially structured it is. Where is the government? And where is their fucking responsibility? As if a government can only exist of police officers. This is the result of deliberate choices, masked as incompetence. The show must go on and taxes must remain low. At all costs, it seems. In the back of my mind, the USA was quite similar to Europe. But this does not seem to be the case. It feels like a different world to me, one that feels a bit dystopian. I've never experienced these things on such a scale, and it feels like politicians have never prioritized it. There is no equality at all, and some human lives seem to be worthless. It hurts me, if I'm honest.

How did it come this far? Are these problems specific to LA or does this provide me with a good image of other large American cities? Did it get worse last years? Is it better in other neighborhoods? How can this be solved?",4919,2022-08-05 07:00:03

I'm sick of LA being bashed when we are the ones keeping the US economy afloat .,"Democratic counties like LA represent 70% of the US economy and California is the best economy in the US and 5th largest in the world with multi billion dollar surpluses every year. 

Republican states on the other hand are some of the most dependent on federal tax dollars by usually large urban centers like LA that generate tax revenue. We here in LA are funding mainly Southern republican states who are unable to generate enough tax revenue to support themselves or what they would call socialism.

 They attack homeless , crime and often use racist dog whistles like the 6th street bridge to bash LA. LA's homeless is a multi faceted issue that's not easy to solve. 

We have many people from out of state attracted to our economy/climate . That along with the high cost of housing (due to it being one of the most popular places in the US to live)  and non existent social resources you end up with a lot of homeless . This is an issue thats going to take time to deal with.  

When It comes to crime It's an issue across the US but LA is nowhere near one of the highest crime city's in the US and aren't even in the top 50 city's with the highest crime. 8/10 highest per capita murder rates are in republican states. Strange how you don't hear anything about that on Fox.  

 The reason I say the 6th street bridge is a racist dog whistle is because of the hundreds of racist comments I've heard on social media. Everything from these people need to go back to Mexico to calling them ghetto trash . These idiots doing donuts need to have their cars taken away but Id be a fucking idiot if I didn't acknowledge the racist dog whistles I hear when people bring up the 6th street bridge.

Los Angeles is the reason certain parts of America don't look like third world countries and I'm sick and fucking tiered of us being used as a political talking point.

I'm fucking livid,"Apologies if this is poorly structured, this happened last night and I'm still raging.

For context, I live in DTLA.

So last night I decided to go to bed earlier than usual (10 PM) and my gf followed suit shortly after. Fast forward to midnight when my dog start barking. He's half German shepherd and half god knows what, so he's a 70 lbs dog. Not exactly huge, but still a big dog. He usually barks at shit during the day as people slam doors as they leave their homes, so when he started barking last night, I thought nothing of it. He barked for a solid 2 minutes, meanwhile my gf and I were calling his name and telling him to stfu. When he wouldn't stop, I get up to check on him. I carry my phone and turn on the flashlight and walk over to his kennel, only to see that he's still barking and not paying attention to my presence. I turn around to see what he's looking at and I shit you not, I see a figure standing in our hallway. My adrenaline shoots to 110%. I get the taste of copper in my mouth and get a clearer picture of the perp. I immediately lose my shit and start screaming at him, asking him what the fuck is he doing in my home and to get the fuck out. During this time, not once did it occur to me to grab my blade which I keep by my door (which I was standing in front of), or to let my dog out. Motherfucker calmly walks over towards me as I hold the door open, locking eyes the entire time. He mumbles that he thought he was in his friend's house as he steps out. I immediately grab my dog's leash, grab my blade, and run right back out to check that he's gone, and not harassing anyone else. Once I step back inside, I can still smell his stench.

I used to tolerate the homeless, but this was the last fucking straw. This is a problem. It needs to be solved. I don't care how. I never cared to own a gun, but that's something I'm looking into now. I know the laws are stringent on it and there's a waiting period, so you bet your ass I'm going to a sporting goods store to get a bat AND a 9 iron.

As I thought on how he could've possibly gotten in, I realize that I had left my door unlocked to let some Spectrum techs in and out of the house (they were on call due to some network issues I was having). People, for the love of god and all that is holy, please check your doors at all times. Even if you're stepping out to take out the garbage, lock your doors.

I'm glad nothing happened to me or worse, my gf. Nothing was taken. But things could've gone BAD.

Sorry about the rant, but I had to spread awareness to hopefully save someone from being injured, or worse. Stay safe out there.

"BEWARE: Crisis Pregnancy Clinic disguised as ""free help"" for pregnant individuals in Long Beach","hello from a concerned community member,

**pro-lifers, get off this post. this is not for you. if you read this and get butthurt, you are a part of the problem.**

i want to inform all of those who come across this ""clinic"" to stay away at all costs. there is a fake pregnancy clinic under the name of Horizon Pregnancy Clinic in Long Beach at 261 E Willow Street, 90806, CA.

this place is an outright attack on those who are pregnant in our community because they try to persuade people to have children in the name of ""religion."" my braindead primary care physician from anaheim sent me here and i was so stressed to the point where i can't even think straight to do research on the place. i thought i could trust my own doctor. i was completely wrong. no one should have to go through what i went through today.

**UPDATE**: did research on the doctor that sent me to this place and she is religious based off her Facebook post promoting gospel music. Reporting immediately to all necessary boards. because some KIND person thought i was out of touch with reality about her being religious, her entire facebook is nothing but religious propaganda to a militant church group. Is that enough proof????? 

**UPDATE #2:** the doctor is directly affiliated with the Nurse manager at this fake clinic. reporting both of them.

when i went today, it was clear at the end of my visit what their motives were. during the duration of the visit, there were no indication of it being a CPC. at the end, the counselor began to ask me what religion i believed in. she started handing me brochures with false information about a made up disorder called post abortion syndrome to try to scare me into having the child. a quick google search shows that no such thing is even acknowledged by the American Psychological Association. they handed me bible studies to attend for ""post abortion recovery."" they also handed me prenatal vitamins with text on it saying ""all life is precious,"" and other pro-life messages that do not help people feel comfortable making an informed decision. this place takes advantage of people in a vulnerable situation in the case of becoming pregnant.

if you care about a pregnant person in your life and want to spare them the stress of being manipulated and guilted by religious dogma. this place also has a location in Huntington Beach.

**please avoid at all costs. fuck this place.**

**every pregnant person should have the right to make a choice for their own body without the shame or stigma from outside pressures.**

Let's talk about how the State of California is bringing the hammer down on bad local governments who won't allow more housing to be built.,"**BOTTOM-LINE, UP FRONT**: *The State of California has issued an ultimatum to LA's local governments: reform your land use laws to allow more housing, or else we nuke your land use law this October and anything goes.*

**THE BACKGROUND**

We're in a housing crisis because it's not legal to build enough housing in LA to meet the demand. The epicenter of the problem isn't in the encampments under the 101 freeway - it's in leafy suburbs like South Pasadena, Manhattan Beach, and Beverly Hills, where new housing has been almost totally banned in the last 50 years.  Because of that, rich people priced out of South Pas move to middle-class Highland Park; middle-class people end up in working-class Boyle Heights; working-class people in Boyle Heights are shit out of luck.  Welcome to gentrification.

The State's solution is, each city has to meet a quota called the [Regional Housing Needs Assessment](https://scag.ca.gov/rhna) and create a legally binding plan to meet it.  (The quota for greater LA is 1.3 million new homes by 2029, and the cities divided up the quota amongst themselves.)  If a city's plan won't cut the mustard, and the State can veto the rezoning plans.  If the State vetoes a rezoning plan, local zoning law is void. Any building is legal to build, as long as it meets the health and safety code, and it's either (i) 20% rent-controlled affordable housing, or (ii) market-rate housing at rents affordable to the middle classes.  So, new residential towers in Beverly Hills? Kosher.  Rowhouses in Redondo? Sure.  Garden apartments in Glendale? Go for it.

**FUCK AROUND AND FIND OUT**

Anti-housing cities know these are the potential consequences of breaking the law, but they've been able to ignore state housing law and screw around for so long that none of them seem to have taken the consequences seriously.  Because most cities' plans are bullshit, full stop.  From my earlier post, a sampling of cities' rezoning plans are:

* Beverly Hills: ""We'll tear down a bunch of 10-story office buildings to build 5-story apartment buildings.""
* Burbank: ""It's legal to put all the new apartments near the freeway and the airport, with all the pollution and the noise, right?""
* Redondo Beach: ""We'll evict Northrop Grumman, which is our city's single largest employer.""
* South Pasadena: ""We'll bulldoze City Hall and replace it with apartment buildings.""
* Pasadena: ""Let's put all the new housing in the redlined neighborhoods.""
* Whittier: ""Let's build a ton of new housing in wildfire zones.""

Pretty much the only good plan that I've seen comes from LA City, which made a serious, data-driven effort to figure out how to meet its 450,000-unit share of the quota.  (If you want to see a rezoning plan, I can send you copies, but they're huge PDFs.)

**BRINGING THE BIG GUNS**

Because the cities' rezoning plans are so egregiously bad, there's all kinds of easy targets here for the State to open fire on.  But it requires the State to keep its nerve.  This only works if you don't give in to pressure from the annoying, loud minority of people who treat city council meetings as the [Festivus Airing of Grievances.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l8Eag9CAFk)  

At first, the State looked like it was going to chicken out.  This is because of what happened with San Diego.  San Diego's rezoning plans were among the first to be reviewed by the State.  And, unsurprisingly, San Diego's rezoning plans were full of the same garbage we've seen for decades:   lots of thoughts and prayers about building more housing, lots of unrealistic assumptions about how housing gets built, and very little concrete action.  With the recall looming, [Governor Newsom's people folded and they rubber-stamped Greater San Diego's lousy rezoning plans.](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/communities/north-county/encinitas/story/2021-08-07/encinitas-finally-wins-state-certification-for-new-housing-plan) It was bad. 

The State forfeited its biggest source of leverage and caved.  It boded ill for the fate of the rest of the rezoning plans all over the state.  After all, there's not too many ways that the State can force local governments to get their shit together without the State Legislature passing new laws.  And, of course, it set a lousy precedent for LA. LA is full of bad-behaving cities who just don't want to build new housing. Worse, it's not just stereotypically  affluent cities like South Pasadena or Santa Monica or Beverly Hills which behave this way.  Middle-class cities like Whittier also have put forth rezoning plans composed of fantastical nonsense.  In fact, there was exactly one well-done rezoning plan, and that was the one drawn up by the City of Los Angeles.  

When the State rubber-stamped the garbage plans from San Diego, I expected the worst.

I am glad to say that I was wrong.  100% wrong.  

**I AM VERY BAD AT PREDICTING THE FUTURE SOMETIMES**

When it came time for the State to review LA's zoning plans, the State didn't just veto these rezoning plans.  They took it one step further, and ordered that if a city's rezoning plan doesn't fix things for real, that city's zoning will be automatically voided in October of this year.  Like I mentioned above, if the zoning gets voided, any new building is legal, as long as it meets the health and safety code, and it's either (i) 20% rent-controlled affordable housing, or (ii) market-rate housing affordable to the middle classes.

But the State didn't just go after the traditional never-build-anything cities, like Redondo, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills and so on.  They're even threatening to nuke the zoning of the city of Los Angeles.  And LA City did a pretty good job of assembling a rezoning plan.  

The State is putting everyone on blast, for real, and taking no prisoners. I suspect that Gov. Newsom is going in guns blazing because he survived the recall handily, and a second term is virtually assured.

**OKAY, FINE, BUT WHAT SHOULD A GOOD ZONING PLAN LOOK LIKE?**

There's going to be a lot of bitching and moaning in LA local government about having to make a compliant rezoning plan.  The thing is, it's not even that hard to put together a rezoning plan that allows for pleasant old-school neighborhoods to be built.  It's basically:

1. [Small apartment buildings](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Dingbat_samoPerdy.jpg) and [SF-style row houses](https://i.imgur.com/9T9Lbu5.jpeg) legalized everywhere.
2. [Mid-sized apartment buildings](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/One-by-five_Apartments_Austin%2C_TX.jpg) near train stations.  
3. [More towers downtown.](https://i.imgur.com/vsWm9g8.png)
4. Automatic approval within 60 days of anything that meets the zoning law and the building code.
5. Abolishing the mandatory parking law.  (LA's current mandatory minimum parking laws require most office and apartment buildings to be 40-50% parking by square footage.)

This is the kind of zoning law that existed during the Red Car era. It ain't rocket science.  Coincidentally, up North, the city of Sacramento just approved this exact type of zoning plan.  (Since Sacramento can figure out how to put together a plan to build lots of new housing, there's no reason why LA's cities can't.)  But if LA cities can't get their act together like Sacramento did, their zoning is going to get nuked come October.  

Sometimes, you fuck around, and you find out. It couldn't happen to better people.

Some of y'all are legitimately fucking insane and need your licenses revoked.,"It's getting really old having my life be at risk every single day because you think it's okay to fly down the street at 100 miles an hour, swerving around and cutting people off with no turn signal and inches to spare. And then if I dare to honk at you we have to play this game of Mario Kart where I get to avoid your insane ass trying to run me off the road, or trying to side swipe, or brake checking me, all while flipping me off and yelling out your window, because how dare someone call you out for being a piece of shit. This shit happens legit every day. Fuck y'all. Seek help.

EDIT: and an extra special fuck you if you're one of those people who sit in the right turn lane at intersections so that you can floor it and swerve into the straight lanes so you get to be ""first"". Grow up and stop treating your one ton death machine like a toy

EDIT2: A lot of you triggered morons saying ""stay out of the left lane then""... First of all, the left lane is not some magical autobahn where you can do 120 and nothing happens to you. You still need to obey speed limits so that you don't cause an accident; cops will still pull your dumb ass over, only some will give you a 10mph leniency. Secondly, I never even said this happened in the left lane of a freeway. It didn't. In fact the vast majority of the time it happens in my experience is on regular main roads regardless of the lane. Thank you so much for your wise words in any case. Keep being mad.",6083,2021-11-08 18:51:25

"Just in case any of you were considering the Van Gogh Immersive event, DON'T waste your money or time.","If you live in LA, you understand there's huge hype and lots of advertising for this event all over social media and plastered on billboards around town. If I can save any of you from spending money on this absolute SCAM, then I won't feel so bad about wasting my time and money there. 

You get into the building and there are some interesting set-design elements: a cool wall, an interesting hallway, and you think, ""oh wow this might be cool,"" but then it spits you out into a room with a bar where you can overpay for canned wine, tacky printed cookies, and a shockingly tasteless ear-shaped lollipop (morally tasteless, I didn't actually spend $16 to try it). The actual event space is a couple big empty rooms with projectors on every surface playing a 35 minute loop of already-composed music paired with already-painted art with a couple of PowerPoint animations sprinkled in. 

I paid extra for the VIP experience because I'm a fucking sucker, so I got two Van Gogh posters. Not posters of actual paintings by Van Gogh, though, *advertising* posters for this bullshit event (two copies of the same poster, btw, they wouldn't waste money on more than one print because this event is a garbage scam that they put the least amount of effort into as they could). Also for the VIP ticket cost of entry, I got two cheap souvenir plastic cushions that'll end up floating in the ocean for a thousand years. They're literally less than an inch thick and do fuck-all for actually buffering my seat on the cold, dirty concrete floor of the event that you have to sit on (because you *won't* get a seat), and I'll literally never use them again.

How much did they squeeze out of me for this 45-minute total ""immersive"" experience? The low-low price of $212. Two hundred and twelve fucking dollars. No refunds. 

I left feeling scammed. They're capitalizing on Van Gogh's art and tragic story in a way that feels disgustingly exploitative. My Fianc√© and I had a good laugh about how bad the entire thing was, but that's about the only positive thing I can say for it. So bad it's almost funny. Don't believe the hype, don't waste your time or money like I did.

**Edit:** To address some common comments:

- $212 was for the VIP experience (for 2), which was sold to me like it would make a difference but it absolutely didn't. Standard entry was still like $40 per person and I STILL think that's too much for what it was. Am I embarrassed I spent that much? Absolutely. Have we maybe all spent a little too much on something we thought would be better than it was? I think probably yeah.

- I went a little high and it still sucked. I concede that psychedelics would probably make it cool, like some of your have said, but psychedelics make empty walls look cool so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

- The experience of seeing the *actual* Van Gogh's at the Norton Simon is 100x better for *significantly* less. Can't recommend that enough. LA has a *lot* of great art, I just thought this would also be fun because I've been to some other live events and exhibits that were great. This one was not only NOT great, it just also felt exploitative and scammy. The exhibit was short, low-effort, way too expensive, and you exited through a gift shop that didn't even exclusively sell Van Gogh merch. I'm not kidding when I say there was Bob Ross art kits, embroidered patches of Munch's *The Scream*, and iced Air Jordan necklaces, it just felt... Gross.",6796,2021-11-01 22:18:31
Performed CPR on someone in Hollywood and can‚Äôt sleep,My buddy and I went to Hollywood last night for Halloween. He started talking to some girls so I walked away since I have a gf. I walked like 2 blocks away to Schrader and Hollywood when I stumbled across a guy who was face down on the pavement. No one was paying attention to him at all. I rolled him on his side and started asking if he was okay but he was completely unresponsive. People started taking note and I asked them to call 911. Someone passed me a phone with an operator and they instructed me to start CPR. I couldn‚Äôt find a pulse so I started chest compressions as instructed by the operator. He started breathing again right before the ambulance pulled up but I‚Äôm still having trouble processing it all.,4197,2021-11-01 12:51:36

Our hospitals are overflowing.,"Hey fellow Angelenos - I write this not to be a downer, but to bring some awareness to our situation as a city going into what is historically a heavy party and gathering weekend. 

Yesterday I was rear-ended by a driver who was not paying attention and was the recipient of a pretty nasty concussion and whiplash. I was instructed by paramedics to go straight to the hospital. 

I‚Äôll cut to the chase: I am straight up traumatized by what I saw yesterday happening in the Emergency Room. Every five minutes a new patient coughing and wheezing was rolled into the ER with horrified family members in tow. You could see the looks on the patients‚Äô faces‚Ä¶it was quite obvious some were not going to be leaving the hospital alive. 

I was in the ER for 6 hours and was never actually given a room and was checked out in a makeshift area in what appeared to be a closet. When I was taken back for x-rays and a CT, patients were overflowing into the hallways‚Ä¶everywhere. The hospital was so busy they had to apologize for not having the time to even give me an Advil for my extreme headache because the doctors were dealing with so many patients and didn‚Äôt have the time to authorize it. 

I watched two families lose loved ones right in front of me. One family tried physically fighting the doctors and nurses and had to be removed by security. I will never forget the screams of the woman who had just wheeled her relative into the ER minutes before he died practically in front of me. It was absolutely traumatizing and something that will be with me for the rest of my life. 

When I was finally discharged I got to speak to a doctor for 2 minutes max. When I left there were at least 30 people OUTSIDE the ER waiting room waiting to be seen due to the waiting room hitting capacity. Babies‚Ä¶the elderly‚Ä¶the injured. All waiting hours because of sheer amount of COVID patients. 

So what‚Äôs my point? I‚Äôm younger and I get some of the frustrations with having to stay home or being told to take something like a vaccine, but yesterday I not only saw, but experienced what this pandemic is actually like first hand. 

Our doctors and nurses - true heroes - are burnt the fuck out. Our medical systems are breaking. People with serious non-COVID injuries are being forced to suffer (or worse) due to the sheer amount of COVID patients still overflowing in our hospitals. 

Yes, I understand the world must go on and we can‚Äôt hide inside forever. But if you are going out this weekend unvaxxed, or are knowingly hanging out with friends who use fake vax cards to skirt the rules, or are ‚Äúanti vax and anti medical‚Äù until YOU get sick with the virus and rush yourself to the hospital‚Ä¶well you are the problem and really need to reevaluate yourself. 

COVID is real. This pandemic is still very real. Just because it‚Äôs happening ‚Äúbehind closed doors‚Äù in our hospitals so we can all go along with our lives pretending everything is normal doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not happening. 

I hope no one has to go through even a sliver of what I saw and heard with my own eyes and ears yesterday. 

Get the shots. Wear a mask. This isn‚Äôt just about you or the virus. It‚Äôs about our doctors and nurses. It‚Äôs about all of us. 

I hope everyone has a great holiday weekend. Do what you can to mitigate the issues. Be safe out there and have a happy Halloween.

EDIT: I am no longer going to be responding to negative comments or accusations as my intention of this post was not to create an argument, but to let people know what‚Äôs going on in our hospitals right now. I‚Äôm just normal dude who had an emergency and had to see some tough shit while having an awful day so I shared.

You Should Skip The Immersive Van Gogh Experience,"This is just a quick PSA/review of the Immersive Van Gogh Experience that's a hot ticket right now. It's severely underwhelming, especially considering the cost of the ticket (ours were ~$55/ticket). If it were an add-on exhibit at LACMA or the Getty, I'd have been like ""this is pretty cool"". Considering it's a $50+ ticket for this alone, it feels almost like a scam.  
  
Essentially you walk into a large room where a collage of Van Gogh paintings are being projected on all the walls and floor. There's some ambient/classical music playing as well. You have to look past the ~200 people who are in the room with you obscuring your view so that detracts quite a bit. It's a big room so you aren't jammed together...but still feels not totally safe. I didn't feel the collage was particularly artful either, it has the feel of a screensaver to be honest. After about 20 minutes you walk into a gift shop and that's it.  
  
Unless you're obsessed with Van Gogh, have cash to burn, or just really want some cliche pics for IG...skip this one.  
  
edit: Just want to add that it seems like in other renditions of this exhibit in cities like NYC and SF, there's a VR component that was NOT present at the one I went to in Hollywood. Would be nice if that were reflected in the ticket price!

Took a LA Taxi for the first time in 15 years!,"So, rideshare is a mess now.  Arrived at LAX around 10 PM.  Checked Uber and Lyft and the fares were only $39 and $45.  I thought it would be easy to get home.  Ordered a Uber and made the long walk to the Uber tents.  

Waited about 45 minutes and neither Uber nor Lyft could find a ride for me.  There were probably a hundred people waiting and I only saw a handful of people actually picked up.  We were on East Coast time and it was cold so the kids and I hopped in a Taxi.  Same fucking shit at 15 years ago.  

I asked how much it would be and was given a vague answer of 'it won't be that much because traffic is not bad'.  Whatever.  We needed to get home.  Driver drove like a maniac, doing 80 to 85 and swerving lanes.  Fine.  That's taxi life I guess.  

$112 later we pulled up to my house and I asked the driver if I use this machine in the back for the credit card payment.  Driver said 'cash is good'.  I asked him how the machine works since it seemed to be off.  Again he said 'pay cash, machine doesn't work'.  I told him no and unloaded the luggage and sent the kids in the house.  Spent 5 minutes with him trying to get Square to work on his phone.  He eventually manually entered my credit card.  

He handed me the phone and told me to enter the tip amount.  He stared at me as I pressed 'no tip' and then gave it back to him.  He cussed me out as I went into the house.

Let's talk about how the State of California is finally starting to hold cities who try to stop building new housing accountable.,"*BOTTOM LINE, UP FRONT: The State of California's new quota system gives the State leverage to force city governments allow more housing, and the State is starting to bring the hammer down.  This is good, and it is long overdue.*

As you all know, we're in a housing crisis.  The root of the problem is that the most desirable places in greater Los Angeles and the Bay Area haven't grown in decades.  Places like Beverly Hills make it incredibly hard or flat-out illegal to build more homes.  This process is pretty straightforward - educated professionals get priced out of places like Beverly Hills (or Manhattan Beach, San Marino, Venice, etc), so they move to places like Echo Park or Highland Park - and poor people and minorities are out of luck.  It's gotten so bad that even outright wealthy types like lawyers and doctors are priced out.  These days, the average house sells for [$3.1 million in Beverly Hills](https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Beverly-Hills_CA/overview), [$2.4 million in San Marino,](https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/San-Marino_CA/overview) and [$3.2 million in Manhattan Beach](https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/Manhattan-Beach_CA/overview).  Housing should be no more than 1/3 of your income, so to afford a $3 million house, you ought to pull down $432,000 a year. That's about [3 1/2 times what the average lawyer makes,](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/california-lawyer-salary-SRCH_IL.0,10_IS2280_KO11,17.htm) and about [twice as much as the the average doctor.](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/california-physician-salary-SRCH_IL.0,10_IS2280_KO11,20.htm)

One of the State's major reforms to tackle this is to establish a binding quota system.  Each region of California gets a new homes quota for the next 8 years, and the cities divide the quota amongst themselves. In greater LA, the regional quota is 1.3 million, and rich cities hate it, [as I've written about at length on this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/m5mht0/lets_talk_about_how_rich_cities_are_trying_to/).   Each city is legally required to produce a realistic, binding plan to meet their share of the quota.  And if the city's plan isn't realistic, the State can veto the city's plan, with real consequences.  (More on the consequences later.)

**SO WHAT ARE THE CITIES DOING TO MEET THEIR QUOTA?**

There are a few cities which are doing things in good faith, like Culver City, and Pasadena. But most of these cities' plans to meet their new housing quotas are bullshit. To illustrate:

* [*Beverly Hills:*](https://beverlyhills.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=&event_id=4739&meta_id=472684) ""We'll tear down a bunch of 10-story office buildings to build 5-story apartment buildings.""
* [*Burbank*:](https://www.burbankhousingelement.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Draft-Burbank-Housing-Element.pdf) ""It's legal to put all the new apartments near the freeway and the airport, with all the pollution and the noise, right?""
* [*Redondo Beach:*](https://www.redondo.org/civicax/filebank/blobdload.aspx?BlobID=39254) ""We'll evict Northrop Grumman, which is our city's single largest employer.""
* [*South Pasadena:*](https://www.southpasadenaca.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/26138/637571138322600000) ""We'll bulldoze City Hall and replace it with apartment buildings.""

All of this is practically begging for the State to veto city housing plans.

**SO WHAT HAPPENS IF THE STATE VETOES A CITY HOUSING PLAN?**

If the State vetoes the city's plan, then all city zoning laws are suspended until they get a legally valid plan together.  Anyone can build any housing, anywhere, of any size, any density, and any shape, and there's nothing the City can do about it as long as: (i) it meets health and safety laws, (ii) it's 100% middle-class housing OR 20% rent-controlled affordable housing.  And if all the stupid City zoning laws disappear, [suddenly it's financially viable to build basic 3-story apartment buildings for normal people like the ones we used to build.](https://letsgola.wordpress.com/2014/12/04/dingbat-renaissance/)  Oh, and if your city doesn't have a valid housing plan, you're ineligible for a bunch of state and federal money.

*This is a big deal.*

Because each of the 88 petty kingdoms of greater Los Angeles has their own set of insane micromanaged laws that make it difficult or illegal to build more homes.  

For example: 

* *Beverly Hills's* law allows the city Planning Commission to kill any proposed apartment building if it doesn't ""[promote the harmonious development of the area](https://www.beverlyhills.org/cbhfiles/storage/files/1108659042674523311/BeverlyHillsMixedUseGuideFeb2021.pdf)."" (""Harmonious development"" = ""whatever we feel like."") Oh, and if the City's busybody architectural commission doesn't like your design, the architects can veto it, too.

* *Huntington Beach* requires [four parking spaces per single-family home.](https://ternercenter.berkeley.edu/research-and-policy/ab-1401-residential-parking-requirements/)  (Think to yourself: how many families do you know that own four cars? Why should this be a requirement?)

* *San Marino,* they ban apartments, period, and [three-quarters of the city is legally required to have a quarter-acre lot.](https://www.cityofsanmarino.org/Revised%20General%20Plan%20Map.pdf)

But if those local laws are suspended, all bets are off, because city governments can't use bad local laws to stop anything from being built.  You want to build [rowhouses](https://i.imgur.com/CthIE5H.png) in San Marino? 100% legal.  You want to tear down an old, crummy tract home in the Valley and [put up a dingbat](https://i.imgur.com/gOWldka.png)?  Mais oui!  You want to [put a skyscraper](https://i.imgur.com/hx531Gt.png) up in Santa Monica?  ¬°S√≠ se√±or!

With all these new State powers, the city councils are taking a big gamble.  The city councils are wagering that the State is going to rubber-stamp whatever bullshit paperwork they send in.  After all, the State has been doing wishy-washy nonsense on housing for 40 years.  The city governments were doing this back when [John Travolta was a sex symbol.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oKPYe53h78)

**SO, IS THE STATE GOING TO CRACK DOWN?**

Oh yes.  The State isn't having any of it.  

Last week, Gov. Newsom's administration vetoed the City of San Diego's housing plan. San Diego's problems were the same ones you see everywhere: putting all the new apartments in neighborhoods with minorities and poor people, not allowing any new homes in rich and white neighborhoods, and playing games with the numbers [to make it look like the city was trying to follow the law.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOTyUfOHgas) The State didn't buy it, and gave San Diego an ultimatum: [fix your plan in 30 days, or anyone can build anything anywhere they want if it meets the health and safety code.](https://twitter.com/CSElmendorf/status/1395054807665287169/photo/1)  The developers down in SD have said they can build [housing for the middle classes by cutting up lots into 1250-2000 square foot parcels and using each parcel for a house, East Coast style.](https://mobile.twitter.com/CSElmendorf/status/1395054817656152064/photo/1)  (For reference, LA lot sizes are about ~7500 square feet.)

You couldn't imagine a better target: San Diego's city government has done some good stuff to encourage more housing construction, and it's the state's second-biggest municipality.  But it's still nowhere near enough.  

This is good, and it's long overdue that the State is finally bringing its powers to bear against shitty, shortsighted local governments.  Local governments have screwed the pooch for almost half a century, and it's how we got into this crisis in the first place. It sends a message to city councils that the State isn't willing to put up with any more gamesmanship.

If city councils keep playing games, the State's response is pretty clear so far: [""fuck around and find out.""](https://i.imgur.com/RhWEj1Z.png)

But all of these options sting way, way less than the thousands of dollars you'll spend and other punishments you'll get with a DUI, (night in jail, if not more, community service + labor, classes, AA, potential house arrest, car repairs if you crash) all of which also steals time from your job that actually allows you to pay for all these things and family life. 

There's prob quite a few people who moved here during the pandemic and haven't ingratiated into normal driving culture yet. What seems shitty at the time is leagues and leagues better than a DUI.

Fuck you assholes who protested the city from cleaning up Echo Park,"[Echoi Park homeless removal protests ](https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2021/03/24/echo-park-lake-homeless-cleanup-los-angeles/)

The city has tried to provide housing for the homeless living in the park. They did what they can. It‚Äôs not the city‚Äôs fault some homeless people refused shelter and chose to stay homeless. Cleaning up this city (both literally and figuratively) starts with dealing with the homeless crisis head on by providing shelter (wherever that may be), offering mental health and drug rehab services, and food. We can‚Äôt start helping the homeless until we actually start removing them from public places all over the city. The longer they live in certain neighborhoods, the more comfortable they will continue living in that neighborhood fir a prolonged period of time, and attract other homeless to the area. 

I was born and raised in LA, and I‚Äôm fucking sick of seeing these goddamn hipsters from buttfuck Ohio, Nebraska or whatever shithole they come from and tell native LA people what‚Äôs good for us. Most of the homeless aren‚Äôt even from LA either, not that it really matters anymore. 

I‚Äôm tired of walking through my streets, seeing trash everywhere, smelling urine and feces, and seeing homeless people smoke crack openly. I know people here say everyday ‚Äúlet‚Äôs put them in a giant facility in the desert that provides health services, food, and transportation‚Äù and it never goes anywhere. But something really needs to be done about this.

I'll pay for you to get your clothes cleaned at my aunt's dry cleaning business,"For the past year, my aunt has been struggling day after day trying to keep her business afloat. Her business has been down 90% without fail every month for the past year. My heart is broken for her because she's the hardest working person I know. Her whole entire life is her job. She's amazing at what she does and will clean your clothes ten times if that's what it takes to ensure every piece comes out looking brand new (but will still only charge you for $8 if that's the original price).

She's struggling and I can't watch her suffer like this anymore. She's also the proudest person I know and won't take a dollar from me to help out during these tough times so here is my plan:

1. Go to my aunt's shop in Westwood. Bring your clothes. She will give you a receipt and will tell you that you pay when you pick it up.
2. Ask her how much it will cost. I will give you my number and you will text me the receipt with the amount on it.
3. I will then venmo/cash app you the total and BOOM FREE DRY CLEANING

EDIT- Oh my gosh, you are all so amazing and making my heart melt. THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart.¬†But look, it‚Äôs a pandemic. And she‚Äôs an upscale dry cleaners. So for those of you who say you won‚Äôt take my Venmo, PLEASE don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to me for help with the bill.

  
Some answers to your questions:

* She is sadly not open Sundays
* You can get your mens collared shirts laundered there if they don't need dry cleaning ($5 difference in price or something like that)
* No alterations but there‚Äôs a great place two shops next to her that does that

I‚Äôm going to bed but will respond to the rest of all you amazing people in the morning.

The LAPD are useless. Sorry for staying the obvious but I‚Äôd like to share this experience I‚Äôve had today with them not responding or taking seriously a violent crime.,"My son was viciously beat and robbed in Venice yesterday. Broad daylight by four people trying to steal his backpack. He was taken to UCLA medical center and treated, the UCLA police department went there. They told him that LAPD needed to take the report as it was in their jurisdiction. We were at the hospital for another 6 hours waiting for them to show up but of course nothing. He was in pain and I decided to take him home. 

Fast forward to today, I drive him to the pacific division to file the report. Their front door is locked and it says to call. So I call the number and they of course tell me a violent crime report needs to be taken in person, so they will get an officer to come out and take the report. 

Keep in mind, I am parked outside the police station. Two and a half hours. Nothing. Two more calls to the LAPD number to ask where they are. ‚ÄúAn officer has been assigned, he‚Äôll get to you when he gets to you.‚Äù Seen about a dozen cops pull into the station but even when flagging one down he says ‚Äúsorry it needs to go to the officer who it‚Äôs been assigned to.‚Äù We ended up leaving. We need the report for insurance but it‚Äôs going to have to wait considering my sons face is swollen and bruised and I want him to get home and rest. 

Where is all the money going? Why do we keep spending millions on the police when they can‚Äôt even bother to step outside the station and take a report? They can deploy 100 cops to pepper spray people protesting but they can‚Äôt get one lazy fuck off his ass to take my sons report?

Edit: I just want to thank everyone for the well wishes. I truly hope we can figure out how to redesign the LAPD as a department that exists to help us, as opposed to whatever it is you want to call it right now.",3473,2020-11-17 21:28:34

Don't eat at the Burbank Chick-Fil-A (Covid-19 related),"So my roommate works at the Chick-Fil-A in Burbank, and they've had four separate employees contract COVID-19, with the most recent case being yesterday. Each time this happens they pull the workers together to explain that these are ""isolated cases"" and that they're so proud of the workers for combating corona. Except they're not isolated. 

&#x200B;

They've taken ""measures"" to protect against COVID, such as having the kitchen workers and the front workers not be able to interact, as well as having separate morning and night crews that will never interact. That sounds fine on paper, except for the fact that some of the workers from different crews live together, and others hang out outside of work all the time. The managers also break their own rules by interacting directly with both crews and walking back and forth from the front and kitchen. They also gathered the entirety of both crews together for a photo to celebrate breaking their sales records during the pandemic.

&#x200B;

One kitchen worker got covid a few months back and was in direct contact with my one friend who worked there. My friend decided to self-isolate for 2 weeks, but that was of his own choice. The company didn't make anyone self-isolate or get tested. In fact, the guy that had corona was able to come back to work 2 weeks later WITHOUT GETTING TESTED. The managers won't tell anyone who ended up getting the virus, I suppose out of privacy, but it's not helpful when it's a matter of if you came into contact with someone that had the virus or not.

&#x200B;

Up until recently they didn't require masks either. Luckily they do now, but still too little too late. Either way, I'm just really worried for my roommate and my other friend, it's seriously dangerous there and I urge you all to not go to the Burbank Chick-Fil-A.

Protestors and looters are two completely distinct groups,"I've been seeing some people trying to lump everything going on today into one group. I know most of us are sitting at home, only able to get information from the news or reading comments here. I've been seeing a lot of brigaders and trolls trying to take advantage of that and spread misinformation. 

I want to make something very clear: The protestors and looters are two completely distinct groups

I was personally at the protests in Santa Monica today. I'm not some random 3 month old account. I'm writing this because what I saw today and what I'm seeing in comments here reaches a point where I cannot stay silent.

---

**The protestors and looters are two completely distinct groups.** 

I was with the various locations of protestors in Santa Monica. They were entirely peaceful, even complying with direct requests from cops. They were far away from the looting, on purpose. 

I looped through downtown SM several times, helping board up or guard small businesses where I could. I saw the Vans store get smashed, kicking off the wave of looting. I saw REI, Patagonia, Road Runner, Converse, jewelry stores get hit. 

The looters did not carry signs. There were no protests nearby. Some brought tools in order to get past metal grates. Groups of them clearly knew each other, and several were wearing gear from Bakersfield or Fresno or other cities well outside LA. 

The cops had droves of officers set up in full gear to intimidate the peaceful protests. They had reinforcements from many nearby cities, as far north as Santa Barbara. They easily had the manpower to prevent looting - preemptively and safely - and chose not to. They know how this looting degrades the image of the protests. They know this will scare up a larger budget for more toys next year.

I‚Äôm. Resident of Melrose/fairfax and own a biz in WehO what I saw last night was not a protest,"I saw mom and pop shops I personally know looted. This wasn‚Äôt one group I saw hundreds if not thousands of kids robbing the very businesses that would rally behind them. I saw butcher get robbed, I saw a nail salon robbed. You didn‚Äôt get me woke to anything, if anything I am more conflicted on lines than ever. They destroyed my community for sneakers and hoodies last night. Please keep these businesses in your thoughts, as most of us are mom and pops sorry for rant but I‚Äôm heart broken 

EDIT: Thank you to all who have already reached out to ask how we can help. Fairfax and Melrose are destroyed just walk down there to get a sense. 

To the people saying just get insurance, they will do whatever they can to not pay this, just like they did to us for Covid. These are people who barely pulled through and now most likely will shutter forever. Only a day before most of us would reopen. We were so optimistic now we are in tears now

Edit 2: more than half if not more on the certain stretch of Melrose are not big biz affiliated minus the obvious cvs. I know these people personally they were afraid for there lives and didn‚Äôt even get the chance to board up. Mostly Latino/Mexican and Asian owned businesses. Why didn‚Äôt they protest the places like lapd hq if those were the enemy?

Update: thank you all to have messaged directly asking how they can‚Äôt help me out. My business is ok as of now, I am lucky but my neighbor wasn‚Äôt so as he got completely looted. 

To clarify my point about being on the line, what happened  to George was murder. Not even here to dispute the fact. I am fed up as much as the next with the constant violence and killing of people by police. The point I am trying to make is that while I want to support this movement, I can‚Äôt and will not condone violence and hurting of innocent people‚Äôs businesses, not every business owner is filthy rich money grubbed looking to maximize profit over people. I am not here to scale murder against theft, we all know what is worst. The point is until the vocal peaceful minority is able to subdue the ranks of people who are looting this will continue to fall on deaf ears and you will lose support from people who agree with your stance but also need to protect their livelihood. I feel as if everyone never learned two wrongs don‚Äôt make a right and people just want to play the tit for tat game. The majority of the looters were for sure there for one reason to loot. The world is watching and for every place that burns you lose one more person who might be able to see what‚Äôs really going on and join the fight.",2280,2020-05-31 13:43:43

I hurry over and put myself between them hoping she takes the moment to leave. Shes frozen. Shes not going anywhere.

Guy is DETERMINED to get to this lady. Pacing like a cat waiting to get to a mouse. Just totally off his rocker. I tell him to fuck off and show I have my keys set up in my hand to hit him if neededm but hes so off he doesnt notice. After after a few minutes he goes for some punches (my real worry was a knife) and seemingly after doing so he notices I have quite a bit weight/height on him and just runs for it.

Behind The Scenes of an Utterly Horrific Night on the Streets and Freeways of Los Angeles...,"Dear /r/LosAngeles,

It was a horrific night on Los Angeles area streets and freeways, with multiple deadly crashes, including those involving at least four wrong way drivers and/or head-on collisions. While cause investigations continue, driver impairment is strongly suspect. 

*We speak of the 4 D's when we mention impaired driving: Those who are drunk, drugged, drowsy or distracted.*

We do hope you and your loved ones had a safe and restful night. Please be aware though, that while you and I rested, public safety personnel performed an unenviable task that could have been prevented...

- - - 

It is most often the duty of law enforcement or the Coroner's office to make death notifications. By all accounts, ""the door knock"" remains one of the most dreaded tasks in public safety. 

Walking up the driveway to a house in moonlit darkness, there is nothing but the empty sound of leaves or gravel beneath your feet, punctuated by the inevitable deep breath and long exhale of those in your group who are equally dreading their duty. Not a one likes to think that hours earlier, the deceased walked that very path. 

Sometimes a dog will bark, but most often it is the knuckles of a veteran Police Officer that will punctuate the solitude with a firm knock upon the door that might as well be cannon fire. 

Having done it. More deep breaths, as house lights come on - a scurry - as a person in semi-dream state asks ""who is it?"". Those three words will be the last ones spoken in a normal tone by the family that morning. 

The door soon opens, often by a blurry eyed spouse or parent in a tattered robe who kindly accedes to our request to enter their home. 

Before we have a chance to get them seated and explain... the ""Oh no, Oh no..."" phase commences. Sobs are stifled as they allow us to explain what they're hoping isn't true. 

The wails that follow take our breath away, and we attempt to be strong, as we patiently wait to see what we can do. At this moment, I can assure you that every member of ""the door knock"" team thinks of their own family. 

Things don't always go well or settle down quickly, and sometimes the task can take hours. The only thing worse that can happen is to have a family member, especially a young child, be awakened by the screaming and enter the room. 

I'll leave it there - as I assure you it isn't a task that any of us would wish upon our worst enemy.

- - -
**If you or a loved one is prone to drive impaired, you need to take action now... to prevent a knock on someone's door.**

Respectfully Yours in Safety and Service,

as a man of low morals I appreciate a good titty bar.  and this sub was **adamant** that I had to go to jumbo's. it was this place's header for a hot minute. 

but now, after experiencing it...i feel like i've been sold a lie. it was all a troll, wasn't it?  like some sort of test for the rookies, is that it?  whatever your motivations, i am not about it!

first of all, i had to wait like 45 minutes to get in this mf.  my first thought was ""oh shit if the line is like this then its gotta be poppin.""  **no**.  the line is long cause u can only fit 10 people in there. whole club bout as big as a toilet seat.  so im already stressed because my big ass is knockin drinks outta people's hands n shit, i got broad shoulders i need room to manuever and there was none to be had. 

then on top of that, there's one stage, one stripper, and its not even topless. and wells were $11. 

imma just be honest, for a 45 minute wait and $11 wells I better see some butthole.  i better see someone pop golf balls out of her cooch into people's drinks.  i need that kind of environment.  not this mickey mouse bullshit.  it felt like the club scene in a movie where the main actress is a stripper but also has a ""no nude"" clause in her contract.  jessica alba in sin city headass bar.

and then on TOP of that, shorties was in there bussin it open to fleetwood mac.  u cant make it clap to stevie nicks man. that just feels sacrilegious.

I'm an architect in LA specializing in multifamily residential. I'd like to do my best to explain a little understood reason why all new large development in LA seems to be luxury development.,"Top edit: thank you very much for the gold, its a first for me.  **And thanks to all the contractors, developers, GCs and finance side folks who have come into the comments with their own knowledge!**  Ill try to reply where I can to comments today.


A big part of my job is to ""spec and mass"" potential new large scale developments for developers who are considering building in LA at a particular site.  Understanding the code and limitations makes it pretty easy to understand why no developers in the city seem to be making the lower cost units everyone wants. 

EVERYTHING built in LA is defined by parking, whether we like it or not. More specifically, everything is defined by our parking code. Los Angeles, unlike, say, New York, has extremely strict parking code for all residential occupancies. For all buildings in an R4 zone (AKA condos and rental units with more than 3 units) each unit is required to have 1 full size dedicated parking space. Compact spaces are not allowed, nor tandem spaces. In making our assessments as to required space for parking, the typical calculation is that each full parking stall will require 375sf of space (after considering not just the space itself but also the required drive aisle, egress, out of the structure, etc. **So that 800sf apartment is actually 1175 sf to build.**

 

But wait, there‚Äôs more! That parking space for each unit either has to be at ground level (which is the most valuable real estate on the whole project), or it has to be above or below ground. Going underground is astronomically expensive, primarily due to removing all that dirt, and the fact that earthquake zones such as LA have expensive requirements for structure below grade. Even going up above grade is problematic, given that the required dead load of vechile parking makes for expensive structure. **So not only is 32% of your apartment just for your car and otherwise useless, but its also by far the most expensive part of that apartment to build.**

 

Now we have to consider the required open space. **Unlike most major urban cities such as New York or Chicago, Los Angeles has a requirement for each unit to have at minimum 100sf of planted open space on site.** At least 50% of that open space must be ‚Äúcommon open space‚Äù. What that means in real terms is that you are required, by code, to have a rooftop or podium garden on your building. As a developer you want as many balconies as possible, since you can charge more for a balcony and typically not so much for a nice communal garden / roofdeck. But even if you give every single unit a balcony, you STILL are required to have that stupid garden to a size of 50sf per unit. At least 25% of that garden must be planted with heavy plants / planter boxes that jack up your dead load and thus jack up the cost of the building‚Äôs structure. 

 

**So now that 800sf apartment you are building is actually a 1275sf apartment, with a garden and a large parking space.**

 

*Can we take at 800sf and divide it into smaller rooms? So a low income family could live there?*

No we can‚Äôt. The required parking and open space are defined by the ‚Äúnumber of habitable rooms‚Äù in the unit. Take that 1 bed room unit and make it a 3 bed room unit and now you have a requirement of 1.25 parking spaces (which rounds up) and 175sf of open space instead of just 100sf. 

 

*What if my apartment is right next to the metro? Do I still need all that parking?*

In January 2013, LA enacted its first major parking reduction, essentially giving developers the option of replacing up to 15% of their required residential parking with bike parking if they are within 1500ft of a major light rail or metro station. However, these bike spaces must be ‚Äúlong term‚Äù spaces, which require locked cages, a dedicated bike servicing area. Also, each removed parking stall requires 4 bike spaces and all spaces must be at ground level, the most valuable real estate on the project. **All this means that the trade is barely less costly than the parking spaces it replaces.**

 

Another thing to consider with building near the metro is something called ‚Äústreet dedication‚Äù. A street dedication is the area between the existing street and the area on a building site that you are allowed to build on. Essentially its space the city is reserving for future expanding of the streets (for wider sidewalks, more lanes, etc. Because the city expects more traffic near these new metro stations, they have altered their plans to have much larger street dedications near the metro stations, squeezing the neighboring lots and raising the cost per square foot of each of these lots. Understandable, but it does not help the issue at hand. 

 

*OK, fine. So how affordable can I make my new rentals / condos??*

All developers consider this as a cost per square foot (CSF). While all the parking and open space requirements make the CSF grow, lets just assume that its all the same. A modest, relatively affordable development might be $130 per sellable square foot to build and sold at $165 (these numbers are VERY oversimplified). If we built our tower in New York code, our cost to build would be $15,600,000. **The same tower in Los Angeles would be $24,862,500** after the premium for shakeproofing and higher dead loading. Now we price both buildings at $165 per square foot, and sell all units. We get 19,800,000. That New York building makes us 4.2million. The Los Angeles building? **You LOSE over 5 million dollars.**

 

This is why you will never again see a new skyscraper in Los Angeles with condos selling for the lower middle class. They literally can‚Äôt build a legal building to code and charge acceptably without destroying their own business. 

 

**Just to break even, our developer for this project would need to charge $207 per square foot.**  Now consider the cost of land (all time high), cost of tower capable contractors in Los Angeles (at an all time high due to demand), as well as marketing, and paying your employees, architects, surveyors, required consultants over the course of multiple years. $300 per foot would be little more than break even. What if something goes wrong? A delay? What do you pay yourself and your investors?

 

**TLDR: Los Angeles, right now, is simply incapable of building affordable rental and condo towers. The only way to make a new highrise building cost effective is to make luxury units, because what would be luxury amenities in New York or Chicago are required in Los Angeles by the building code, not optional. That was OK back when LA had cheap land and cheap construction, but our land and labor costs have caught up to other cities.**








edit: adding this from something I wrote in the comments because I completely forgot to mention:

**Traditionally, contracting was the best paying ""blue collar"" job out there**, and to a certain extent it still is. If you were smart, hardworking, but didn't go to college, you started hauling bricks on a construction site and then worked your way up to general contractor over the course of years. Lots of the best GCs out there did this. **But, as less and less of super capable kids DON'T go to college, there are less super capable 18 yearolds hauling bricks and 10 years later, less super capable GCs.**



**All that was manageable to an extent before the crash of 2008.** Architecture (my job) was hit VERY hard, but it was the construction industry that was hit the hardest. A massive portion of the best (older and experienced) contractors left job sites, either to retire or go into consulting. Now that development has exploded and we need as many GCs as possible, we architects have to deal with less and less experienced contractors, who charge more and more.



**While there are LOTs of guys and gals out there who can swing a hammer and go a good job on site, being the GC of a major project we are talking about is one of the hardest, most underappreciated jobs out there.**



**Its like conducting an orchestra where, for every missed note, thousands and sometimes millions of dollars are lost.** Everything is timed down to the day, sometimes the hour. Hundreds of people, from suppliers to subs are involved. Any mistake will gouge you. Safety must be watched like a hawk or OSHA will eat you. Its a rare breed of construction worker who can handle this job, and they've never been in higher demand or shorter supply in Los Angeles. In 10 years this problem won't exist (we may have a surplus of good GCs actually), but right now its a dog fight getting the good ones to work with you. They have all the power and charge accordingly.",2429,2017-07-07 19:08:07

TIL: The LA Parking Violations Bureau is actually run by Xerox. Jeff Galfer has spent 4 years trying to get a Class Action lawsuit started for us and has given up due to the threats from Xerox and the roadblocks run by judges with conflict of interests.,"Link is here and I think everybody here should read this: https://www.facebook.com/nomoretickets/posts/917361671637046?fref=nf&pnref=story

> FINAL UPDATE:

> As you all know (at least many of you), I have been fighting this case since December of 2011 (when I received multiple late fees on a ticket I had appealed in August of 2011). When I didn't hear anything from my appeal and was still charged late fees, it was clear that something was going on with this institution. Over the years, we learned A LOT about how they run the parking bureau. We learned that Xerox is contracted by the city to run the entity known as the Los Angeles Parking Violations Bureau. We learned that Xerox not only collects the ticket money from you, but also decides whether or not you are guilty (during the initial review of the appeal's process). We learned that Xerox gets incentives for drawing out the time it takes to collect on tickets. We learned that Xerox was not paying for mail forwarding - meaning - if the ticket went to the wrong address, they really had no interest in making sure it got the right address. We learned that Xerox calls the shots and the City is really their monkey boy. The city is often times ignorant to the practices of Xerox.
> 
> After we filed the class action and went after them in court, we hit multiple patches of bad luck. Our first judge's husband worked for Xerox and had to resign from the case. The second judge we received firmly believed (out of the gate) that citizens should not attempt to interfere with corporate interest. To this day, we find no other reasoning in the judgement that can clarify his position - essentially that everyone in LA is negatively affected by this, but we are not allowed to collectively take a stand against them. We can only assume his bias is for that of corporation good, citizens secondary to the good the corporation brings to the City.
> 
> So, we were shot down left and right. When the time came to settle (to avoid a trial), we were able to get Xerox and the City of Los Angeles fighting against each other for the first time. Xerox was furious because it was the first time they were not calling the shots. Because of this, the first mediation collapsed and things were looking very good for us.
> 
> Unfortunately, in between the first and second mediation, the judge got very angry - at everyone. He was not happy for the way Xerox handled the first mediation, but he was very clear that he didn't want this to go to trial. So, he decided to make a bunch of summary judgments against us. Again, we couldn't (to this day) figure out why he did this. There was really no rational argument aside from he did not want this to go to trial and he had to stop us.
> 
> At that point, we lost ALL of our power. Last week, we decided to settle the case out of court. As much as I felt the case should go to trial, Xerox was very clear with their threats. If we went to trial, they told me they would sue me for ALL of their costs - essentially taking away everything I own and making me homeless. This was a clear and calculated threat and one that was used against me in order to get my lawyers to back down. And unfortunately, there was nothing I could do. This was not my fight any longer.
> 
> Having said that, some policy changes have been agreed to as part of this case. Here they are:
> 
> 1. They have done away with most of the policies that allow an automatic upholding of the ticket on initial review.
> 
> 2. You automatically receive a penalty waiver and late appeal if a notice is returned as undeliverable.
> 
> 3. The California court has now held in the other case that Xerox is not allowed to perform initial reviews. This is subject to a pending appeal.
> 
> The City, in response to our suit, made multiple policy changes. The critical issue of Xerox performing the initial review is now subject to an appeal in another case in California State Court. Essentially, a California judge said it is absolutely illegal for Xerox to run the appeal's process. Xerox appealed. And so it goes. Another waiting game.
> 
> At the end of the day, I tried. And I spent 4 years trying. And as of now, I'm leaving the fight.
> 
> If Xerox loses their state court appeal, I would suggest going after this individually. If you can prove there was malpractice here, you'll have a good chance to go after them then (when the state of California officially deems their place in the appeals process is illegal).
> 
> Thank you all for the support. I wish you the best of luck with your individual cases.

Nothing like LA after a storm,,4512,2014-12-12 19:11:31
Ran into Nick Young's broken down Ferrari. Couldn't have been more of a douche. Rejected little kid's autograph requests then called me Alladin (I'm brown) and sent his thug entourage to threaten me.,,2138,2014-11-01 21:45:30
Can LAFD Paramedics ask you a personal favor?,"It's been a while since Halloween has occurred on a weekend night. To be blunt, we're expecting the streets and highways of Los Angeles to be especially bloody tonight - and we're not talking moulage.

Before the sun rises on Saturday morning, some of your LAFD medics are likely to accompany a Police Officer, Chaplain or Coroner to what we call ""the door knock"". It's a **profoundly** unenviable task that takes its toll. The wailing screams of parents, spouses, friends and family stays with us *forever*. 

Your wise choices and guidance of others during this weekend will go a long way in helping us. A simple and well communicated plan for key control, designated drivers, the use of taxis - or simply a place where drunk, impaired or drowsy guests can safely sleep it off until they're wide awake and 110% sober is all that we ask. 

Tonight, like every night - we'll be there when you need us. Let's work together though, to limit the chances of that happening by accident. 

Respectfully Yours in Safety and Service,

Brian Humphrey 
Firefighter/Specialist
Public Service Officer
Los Angeles Fire Department

"My Father Is Missing: Please Help - Last Seen In Koreatown Friday, September 5th","**MY** **FATHER** **HAS** **BEEN** **FOUND!!!!**

My apologies if this goes against any admin rules, but I know Reddit does wonderful things.

My father, Jin S. Kang was last seen leaving my sister's apartment (his temporary residence) near the 400 block of Occidental, between 3rd St. and 6th St in Koreatown, LA on Friday, September 5th at around 11 am.

Height: 5'9""
Weight: 142 lbs
Age: 70
Distinctive features: ""H"" tattoo on his left right finger, ""G-J"" tattoo on his right shoulder

Missing persons report has been filed:
Rampart LAPD: 213.484.3403
Case number: 140217024

Reward will be offered for any information that will help the police and my family track him down.

It's been over 35 hours since he left home. He didn't take his wallet, cell phone, or the house keys so we have no way of tracking him. He just moved to LA a few months ago for hospital treatment. 

Thank you

**Update #1:** Thank you for your support Los Angeles Redditors! I'm blown away by the support, thoughts, and love from my fair city.

My family is checking local Los Angeles area hospitals, morgues, and homeless shelters. We will check these locations again tomorrow.

No local hangouts: He's only been in Los Angeles for several months, mostly in hospitals and at my sister's place. He doesn't have any friends, but he did take occasional walks around 3rd St., Occidental Blvd., and 6th St. but could never get very far because of his weakened stated. He also doesn't drive.

Thank you thank you.

**Update #2:** Created the inevitable 'missing person' flyer. Thank you L.A.!

**UPDATE #3!!:** Redditor ""2Days"" may have found my father on the corner on FAIRFAX. My sister and brother are headed there now. Will update!

**Update #4!!!:** CONFIRMED - MY FATHER HAS BEEN FOUND! Redditor ""2Days"" gets all the love and respect in the world. I can't say thank you enough!!!  

My dad traveled 5 miles west over the course of 48 hours without any money. He's extremely HUNGRY and didn't get much water so we are going to give him some medical attention, food, and water. I have a lot of questions, but for now I can only be relieved.

I want to thank EVERYONE in REDDIT/LOSANGELES for the amazing support I've received. Without YOUR up votes, without YOUR kindness, without YOUR actions, this would have never, ever happened. I have a newfound respect for anything and everything LA. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!

**Update #5** People have been PM'ing a bunch of questions and rather than replying individually, I'm putting it up here. 

**A.** **Why** **did** **your** **dad** **leave?** Depresssion? Alzheimer's? Drunk and confused? He hasn't said much but we are going to get him a full evaluation so it doesn't happen again. We've left him at home countless times because everyone in the family works. He does take small walks around the neighborhood and never expected him to land 5 miles west -- no car, not very mobile, no friends, no $$$

**B.** **Your** **dad** **is** **not** **malnourished!** OK, agreed, he was just hungry, tired, and sunburned. I've changed the main text to reflect this. I apologize for sensationalizing it.

**C.** 2Days is a hero. My dad didn't make an effort to even try to get back home and I would have NEVER thought to have looked to Fairfax Blvd. We looked all over KTown and DTLA

**D.** **What** **do** **the** **tattoos** **mean?** Tattoos were related to my dad's thuggish life growing up in post-Korean War South Korea. The letters have no meaning, other than that they were tied to an ""initiation"" process.

**D.** **Reward?!** Yes, I'm mailing him a snail mail check reward. **2Days** **refused**, but I'm sending it to him anyways. I'm also sharing the more intimate process of my dad's recovery w/ him through PMs.
