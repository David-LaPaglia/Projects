"Whether you believe in climate change or not, I dont understand why we still wouldn't pursue alternative forms of energy considering natural gas and oil is a finite resource while renewable energy is infinite. Also, why cant we get behind preserving nature and wildlife on Earth. We also take clean drinking water for granted, but thats even a stretch (""cough flint Michigan cough"")

But I do agree climate change fear mongering is a little blown out of proportion

Edit: I love all of the comments I've gotten to read. I love reading different opinions especially about a topic im very passionate about. Im an energy engineer with a masters in renewable clean energy for reference. Yet at work I mainly deal with commissioning/ retro-commissioning projects.

Edit: when I say renewable is infinite, im referring to how the sun n wind is practically infinite and will never disappear. We also have hydro and geothermal which a lot of people forget about.

Edit: some people are commenting about residential solar. Which when chatting with them, I didnt portay my opinion correctly when saying solar is affordable. I dont expect the average Joe to buy the panels themselves. That duty and pressure will fall on the utility companies. BUT if you truely wanted to buy a small solar system for your house you absolutely can and it is affordable. 
https://www.consumeraffairs.com/solar-energy/how-much-do-solar-panels-cost.html

I remeber research cost in college years back thinking $20k is not terrible. On average now for a simple system, it can be $15k or less. Which can probably lower your bill in half as well as sell energy back to the grind.

Edit: Look up Evansville, Indiana if you want to see the true effects of coal on human health.",climatechange
"The problem isn't really the temperature, but the rate of temperature increase.  You can even see in that plot you posted that the rate of increase is way higher than normal. The effect will be that ecosystems will have a hard time adapting fast enough, and many plant and animal species will go extinct.  The biggest issues for people will be a change in what land can be framed and how many people can be supported in different places.  That is going to be a huge problem for the developing world.  For the US, not so much.  We'll adapt.",climatechange
"OP this doesn't mean anything. No one is arguing that humans are causing the planet to get too warm for the planet. Global warming is simply inconvenient for us. The earth goes through cycles of ice ages and glacial periods, regardless of what we do. But by pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere we're speeding up the cycle. If we had left things alone, the polar caps could take a long time before they melted again. By doing what we're doing, we're shortening that time dramatically, perhaps by the order of 99%. 

Having tens of thousands of years to prepare for stuff is one thing, having only 100-200 is quite another. 

And I hate this attitude that calling it climate change is some kind of cop-out. It's not. Climate change is a more accurate term than global warming because pumping GHG into the atmosphere isn't going to make it a lot warmer in some places. The Sahara Desert, for example, is not going to get much warmer. Some places will get a little warmer, and some will get a lot warmer. Also, rainfall patterns will change, and this is a big problem, because it will change what land is viable as agricultural land. 

If anyone doubts that GHG cause global warming, I really encourage you to just start learning the science. Don't look at anything political, just learn the science. Just learn some basic physics. Learn what heat is. Learn what blackbody radiation is. Learn what light is. Learn how we get energy from the sun and how we lose it into space. 

Greenhouse gases are transparent to visible light but opaque to infrared light. This means that increasing them makes the earth warmer. I don't have time to spell it all out, you've got to do your own reading and learning. 

Does this mean that leftwing politicians are right? No. Politics is a completely different matter, and a lot of left wing ""solutions"" to this problem are garbage. But that's another debate. As for the science, human - caused global climate change through the burning of fossil fuels is 100% true. Trying to deny that is like denying very basic physics, it's just ignorant.",climatechange
"Hey bud, 500 million years ago the Earth was uninhabitable. 

“The land was barren, likely dry and rocky. Locally, there may have been microbial soil crust. There was no vegetation as we know it today - no grass, no trees, no plants. This photo shows what the land may have looked like 500 million years ago, during the Cambrian Period.”

"Yeah sure, Earths average temperatures has fluctuated very often, and the planet is fine, life on it just goes on...

...but you might want to take this graph and put a timeline of mass extinctions on top of it. These happened at 445, 375, 252, 200, and 66 million years ago, and the 6th is happening right now. Do you notice something with these dates and the dates on your graph?

Then go and look up what triggered these events. You'll find that half of them were caused by asteroid impacts or volcanic activity. 2 of them are actually attributed to general rapid change in the climate (one cooling, another warming). ""Rapid"" in this case meaning over the span of over a million years. Not the few decades the current drastic change is happening in; also note that Earth was actually cooling down and based on historic data isn't supposed to be warming up at all, that is until the industrial revolution kicked into high-gear.",climatechange

"“planet” cant care less about global warming, cooling, co2 and so on. 

Even nuclear winter. 

Some species will go, other species will flourish.

The only ones who we hurting by this is ourself, and we should act with our own interest in mind weighting tradeoffs.",climatechange
"I'm struggling to see your point. Yes, earth has been a lot hotter than it is now, no one is arguing that. The problem is that the rate at which earth is warming up is extremely high. Of course, that doesn't matter to earth. But to humans and pretty much all other species on earth, such a sudden rise in temperatures will probably have massive consequences. If we partially prevent, or at least limit the amount of sudden warming, the consequences will probably be less. And there is nothing in this graph that suggests this isn't the case. So what is your point?",climatechange
"Most of these other events weren't step changes in the climate, but slower gradual processes, where life could adapt a little more easily. The ones that were step changes (meteorite impacts, mass eruptions) had very bad consequences. 

The current change the climate is experience is on the order of 100-200 years, which is a step change on the scale you plotted, and something we should be very worried about.",climatechange
"That's a great chart! You should add the 6 mass extinction events to it to demonstrate the effects of climate change. I wonder which genus will take over the world this time?

Doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t try to slow it down or find a solution.,climatechange
"There is another graph that is also relevant.

Some might argue that 500M years is mostly w/o human inhabitants. So the temp cycles of the last 5M years is a better argument (with similar results). It has to do with ""Milankovitch Cycles"" that science really can't totally explain w/planetary orbitals. Some suspect earth's core and magneto-dynamics are in play too.

The WikiPedia article on [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100,000-year\_problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100,000-year_problem)

See the chart here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch\_cycles#/media/File:Five\_Myr\_Climate\_Change.svg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles#/media/File:Five_Myr_Climate_Change.svg)

The fluctuation changes are +2° to -8° C. It shows we are at the peak of the current cycle and about to go into another cold cycle. So yes, even if man-made CO2 does affect the temp more than say, venting volcanos and ocean bio-mass does, we need to be prepared for global cooling by Nature.

This is one reason for the global cooling scare of the 60s-70's, which was the first attempt at using climate for justifying globalism in autocratic Socialist/Marxist style governments.",climatechange
So yeah we’ll continue to raise the temp until we humans can no longer exist on this planet and then earth will fix itself. Seems like our good old planet is a problem solver!,climatechange
"This is the sort of “gotcha” bullshit that turned news and reporting and journalism into…well, anything but.

We should do our best to minimize our negative environmental footprints, but in a rational way that doesn’t destroy our economy.",climatechange
"There's very little meaning to historic data with regards to how the planet will react to a very swift rise in temperatures. Life won't go extinct, and humans neither, but it's everyone's interest to lower the rate and even stop the temperature rise.

"The scale of this is misleading. It doesn't even represent western civilization (please try and isolate 400 or 1000 years and give me the slope, I dare you). Let alone industrial civilization.

""Today"" looks like a vertical line straight up and is kind of the only relevant piece, and it does *not* do your point any favors. Also what year is ""today""? Because that matters.

The notion that climate change is a liberal hoax is the product of propaganda. Oil lobby says hi.

The notion that any person in a position of power wants to press a button and “stop all fossil fuels”- is a product of propaganda.

Plus, the ocean at that time was one continuous ocean, and our oil comes from algae that flourished 350 million years ago in that 8 times CO2 level air.",climatechange
"It seems to show that in the last 150 years or so, the temperature has risen so abruptly that we are half way to having no ice caps. That is insane, and incredibly alarming.

Also, humans of only been around for the last 300,000 years. In the blink of an eye we have abruptly changed the make-up of the earth's atmosphere, and the impacts are being seen globally.

At this point, no-one but the most corrupt politicians and business heads deny man-made climate change. It's like denying gravity.

As always, follow the money. Those who deny or attempt to trivialize man-made climate change almost always have links to the fossil fuel industry.

The earth has been going through cooling and warming patterns for millennia, we have only been recording these temperatures for an extremely recent and insignificant slither of the earths history.

Have and continue to play a significant role in various forms of climate change. The earth has been way hotter on average for much of it's history, but it's the rate of the temperature increase that's the biggest issue, not necessarily the fact that they are happening.

My biggest concern isn't the temp but the acidification of our oceans. THAT'S going to be the real issue in THIS generations life time. Combined with micro plastics in the oceans, you've got the recipe for predator species of fish becoming extinct in the coming years. Specifically marlins. 1 in 4 of them are born as hermaphrodites (male and female sex organs) and can't reproduce properly.

For the US, not so much.  We'll adapt.",conservative
"OP this doesn't mean anything. No one is arguing that humans are causing the planet to get too warm for the planet. Global warming is simply inconvenient for us. The earth goes through cycles of ice ages and glacial periods, regardless of what we do. But by pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere we're speeding up the cycle. If we had left things alone, the polar caps could take a long time before they melted again. By doing what we're doing, we're shortening that time dramatically, perhaps by the order of 99%. 

Having tens of thousands of years to prepare for stuff is one thing, having only 100-200 is quite another. 

And I hate this attitude that calling it climate change is some kind of cop-out. It's not. Climate change is a more accurate term than global warming because pumping GHG into the atmosphere isn't going to make it a lot warmer in some places. The Sahara Desert, for example, is not going to get much warmer. Some places will get a little warmer, and some will get a lot warmer. Also, rainfall patterns will change, and this is a big problem, because it will change what land is viable as agricultural land. 

If anyone doubts that GHG cause global warming, I really encourage you to just start learning the science. Don't look at anything political, just learn the science. Just learn some basic physics. Learn what heat is. Learn what blackbody radiation is. Learn what light is. Learn how we get energy from the sun and how we lose it into space. 

Greenhouse gases are transparent to visible light but opaque to infrared light. This means that increasing them makes the earth warmer. I don't have time to spell it all out, you've got to do your own reading and learning. 

Does this mean that leftwing politicians are right? No. Politics is a completely different matter, and a lot of left wing ""solutions"" to this problem are garbage. But that's another debate. As for the science, human - caused global climate change through the burning of fossil fuels is 100% true. Trying to deny that is like denying very basic physics, it's just ignorant.",conservative
"Hey bud, 500 million years ago the Earth was uninhabitable. 

“The land was barren, likely dry and rocky. Locally, there may have been microbial soil crust. There was no vegetation as we know it today - no grass, no trees, no plants. This photo shows what the land may have looked like 500 million years ago, during the Cambrian Period.”

"Yeah sure, Earths average temperatures has fluctuated very often, and the planet is fine, life on it just goes on...

...but you might want to take this graph and put a timeline of mass extinctions on top of it. These happened at 445, 375, 252, 200, and 66 million years ago, and the 6th is happening right now. Do you notice something with these dates and the dates on your graph?

Then go and look up what triggered these events. You'll find that half of them were caused by asteroid impacts or volcanic activity. 2 of them are actually attributed to general rapid change in the climate (one cooling, another warming). ""Rapid"" in this case meaning over the span of over a million years. Not the few decades the current drastic change is happening in; also note that Earth was actually cooling down and based on historic data isn't supposed to be warming up at all, that is until the industrial revolution kicked into high-gear.",conservative
"The same science that produced this graph is saying that we are having a major impact on our climate. Couple that with our garbage problem, we need to change how we live.",conservative
"i shouldn’t really have to say it, but some people dont understand. this graph really doesnt tell us about our current situation. even small degrees in temperature changes can cause dramatic and severe changes to our planet that can not be undone. i urge people, who dont believe or think its not serious, to really look into the facts. even if you dont believe in climate change, we should be trying to live more sustainably especially since fossil fuels are a limited resource and eventually we have to use something else",conservative
"“planet” cant care less about global warming, cooling, co2 and so on. 

Even nuclear winter. 

Some species will go, other species will flourish. 

Business as usual. 

The only ones who we hurting by this is ourself, and we should act with our own interest in mind weighting tradeoffs.",conservative
"I'm struggling to see your point. Yes, earth has been a lot hotter than it is now, no one is arguing that. The problem is that the rate at which earth is warming up is extremely high. Of course, that doesn't matter to earth. But to humans and pretty much all other species on earth, such a sudden rise in temperatures will probably have massive consequences. If we partially prevent, or at least limit the amount of sudden warming, the consequences will probably be less. And there is nothing in this graph that suggests this isn't the case. So what is your point?",conservative
"Most of these other events weren't step changes in the climate, but slower gradual processes, where life could adapt a little more easily. The ones that were step changes (meteorite impacts, mass eruptions) had very bad consequences. 

The current change the climate is experience is on the order of 100-200 years, which is a step change on the scale you plotted, and something we should be very worried about.",conservative
"That's a great chart! You should add the 6 mass extinction events to it to demonstrate the effects of climate change. I wonder which genus will take over the world this time?

My bets are on Blattodea. Those cockroaches can survive anything!",conservative
Doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t try to slow it down or find a solution.,conservative
"There is another graph that is also relevant.

Some might argue that 500M years is mostly w/o human inhabitants. So the temp cycles of the last 5M years is a better argument (with similar results). It has to do with ""Milankovitch Cycles"" that science really can't totally explain w/planetary orbitals. Some suspect earth's core and magneto-dynamics are in play too.

The WikiPedia article on [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100,000-year\_problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100,000-year_problem)

See the chart here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch\_cycles#/media/File:Five\_Myr\_Climate\_Change.svg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles#/media/File:Five_Myr_Climate_Change.svg)

The fluctuation changes are +2° to -8° C. It shows we are at the peak of the current cycle and about to go into another cold cycle. So yes, even if man-made CO2 does affect the temp more than say, venting volcanos and ocean bio-mass does, we need to be prepared for global cooling by Nature.

This is one reason for the global cooling scare of the 60s-70's, which was the first attempt at using climate for justifying globalism in autocratic Socialist/Marxist style governments.",conservative
So yeah we’ll continue to raise the temp until we humans can no longer exist on this planet and then earth will fix itself. Seems like our good old planet is a problem solver!,conservative
"This is the sort of “gotcha” bullshit that turned news and reporting and journalism into…well, anything but.

"The thing is that last candle up on the right of your chart is way faster than it has ever been in the history of our planet.

Regardless, agree that politicization of this has gone to irrational levels. We should do our best to minimize our negative environmental footprints, but in a rational way that doesn’t destroy our economy.",conservative
"There's very little meaning to historic data with regards to how the planet will react to a very swift rise in temperatures. Life won't go extinct, and humans neither, but it's everyone's interest to lower the rate and even stop the temperature rise.

But it needs to be addressed smartly, and not by wasting billions on useless policies that won't do anything or might actually do more harm than good.",conservative
"The scale of this is misleading. It doesn't even represent western civilization (please try and isolate 400 or 1000 years and give me the slope, I dare you). Let alone industrial civilization.

This is a perfect example of cherry picked scale chosen to suit a narrative. If the concern is the rate of increase over 100 years, how could you begin to call this relevant information? ""Today"" looks like a vertical line straight up and is kind of the only relevant piece, and it does *not* do your point any favors. Also what year is ""today""? Because that matters. Was this mapped out in the 70's, 90's etc?",conservative

Let's say we all agree that the rise in global temperatures is all man made. Why does every solution demand a surrender of personal rights and freedoms to an authoritarian state?

Look y’all. I’m not saying stop burning gas. I do it every day on the way to work. I’m saying stop living in a fantasy land constructed from oil lobby propaganda. Support funding renewables WHILE MAINTAINING current critical fossil fuel uses. 

The notion that climate change is a liberal hoax is the product of propaganda. Oil lobby says hi.

The notion that any person in a position of power wants to press a button and “stop all fossil fuels”- is a product of propaganda.

"Something else that blows their minds is mentioning that, 350 million years ago, we had 8 times the CO2 levels we have today, and life not only survived, but flourished to the point of most of the continents had dense forests and swaps on nearly all coasts, and that's where our coal comes from.  Plus, the ocean at that time was one continuous ocean, and our oil comes from algae that flourished 350 million years ago in that 8 times CO2 level air.",conservative
"It seems to show that in the last 150 years or so, the temperature has risen so abruptly that we are half way to having no ice caps. That is insane, and incredibly alarming.

Also, humans of only been around for the last 300,000 years. In the blink of an eye we have abruptly changed the make-up of the earth's atmosphere, and the impacts are being seen globally.

At this point, no-one but the most corrupt politicians and business heads deny man-made climate change. It's like denying gravity.

As always, follow the money. Those who deny or attempt to trivialize man-made climate change almost always have links to the fossil fuel industry.

So it appears that this graph, removed from the context in which it shows you are wrong, is blowing your mind but no-one else's.",conservative

The earth has been going through cooling and warming patterns for millennia, we have only been recording these temperatures for an extremely recent and insignificant slither of the earths history.

The earth has been way hotter on average for much of it's history, but it's the rate of the temperature increase that's the biggest issue, not necessarily the fact that they are happening.

My biggest concern isn't the temp but the acidification of our oceans. THAT'S going to be the real issue in THIS generations life time. Combined with micro plastics in the oceans, you've got the recipe for predator species of fish becoming extinct in the coming years. Specifically marlins. 1 in 4 of them are born as hermaphrodites (male and female sex organs) and can't reproduce properly.
