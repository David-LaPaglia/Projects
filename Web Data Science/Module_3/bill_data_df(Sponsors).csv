1,HB16-1002,Employee Leave Attend Child's Academic Activities,"In 2009, the general assembly enacted the 'Parental Involvement in K-12 Education Act' (2009 act), which allowed an employee of an employer who is subject to the federal 'Family and Medical Leave Act' to take leave from work for the purpose of attending academic activities for or with the employee's child. Under the 2009 act, academic activities included parent-teacher conferences or meetings related to special education services, interventions, dropout prevention, attendance, truancy, or discipline issues. The leave was allowed for an employee who is the parent or legal guardian of a child enrolled in a public or private school or in a nonpublic home-based educational program in this state in kindergarten through twelfth grade.Leave under the 2009 act was limited to 6 hours per month and 18 hours in any academic year. The 2009 act permitted employers to:Restrict the use of leave in cases of emergency or other situations that may endanger a person's health or safety or if the employee's absence would halt the employer's service or production; andLimit the leave to 3-hour increments at a time and require the employee to submit written verification from the school or school district of the activity necessitating the leave.An employee was required to provide the employer with at least one week's notice of the leave except in emergency situations.The 2009 act specified that the 2009 act would repeal on September 1, 2015. The repeal provision was never amended, so the 2009 act repealed on September 1, 2015.The bill recreates and reenacts the 2009 act with some modifications as follows:Requires school districts and institute charter schools to post on their websites, and include in district-wide or school-wide communications sent to parents and the community at large, information about the act;Requires the Colorado state advisory council for parent involvement in education to also provide information about the act to the extent possible within existing resources; andContinues the act indefinitely and amends the original repeal date in the 2009 act to specify that the repeal was to apply only to the 2009 act.(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)Read More",Session:2016 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeJanet BucknerSenatorAndy Kerr
2,HB16-1003,Middle Class College Savings Act,"For purposes of calculating a taxpayer's Colorado taxable income, current state law begins from a base of the taxpayer's federal taxable income and provides for various modifications to that base, including subtractions from federal taxable income (state income tax deductions) in amounts equal to the full amounts of both contributions made by a taxpayer to the qualified state tuition program established by collegeinvest and distributions of investment earnings taken from the plan.

133,HB16-1134,Service-disabled Veteran-owned Business In Procurement,"In 2014, the general assembly established a goal that, in awarding contracts that are subject to the state 'Procurement Code', the state would award at least 3% of all contracts by dollar value to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. The bill changes the procurement goal into a requirement as follows:In the 2016-17 fiscal year, at least one percent of state contracts by dollar value shall be awarded to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses;In the 2017-18 fiscal year, at least 2% of state contracts by dollar value shall be awarded to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses; andIn the 2018-19 fiscal year and in each fiscal year thereafter, at least 3% of state contracts by dollar value shall be awarded to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses.Current law allows a state agency to grant a preference to a service-disabled veteran-owned small business to satisfy the procurement goal. The bill maintains the ability for a state agency to grant such a preference to satisfy the procurement requirement and also allows a state agency to grant a preference for a business that includes in its bid that it will use at least one service-disabled veteran-owned small business as a subcontractor if the business is awarded the contract. The bill also authorizes a state agency to include work performed by a subcontractor that is a service-disabled veteran-owned small business to satisfy the procurement requirements.If a business is given a preference on the basis of using one or more service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses as a subcontractor, the bill requires the business to submit certain information to the state agency that awarded the contract regarding the number of such subcontractors used and the approximate dollar value of work that was performed by such subcontractors.Current law requires a business to be certified as a service-disabled veteran-owned small business by the center for veterans enterprise within the United States department of veterans affairs before being given a preference. Due to the significant amount of time that it takes for a business owner to obtain a service-disabled veteran-owned small business certification, the bill extends service-disabled veteran-owned eligibility to business owners who have applied for certification from the center for veterans enterprise and who have submitted certain documentation to the secretary of state's office regarding the business owner's release or discharge from active duty military, the business owner's military service-related disability, and the business owner's efforts to become an officially registered and verified service-disabled veteran-owned small business by the center for veterans enterprise.The bill directs the secretary of state to create and maintain on its website a list of businesses that have not yet been officially registered and verified as a service-disabled veteran-owned small business by the center for veterans enterprise but that have submitted the required documentation for service-disabled veteran-owned small business eligibility. The bill specifies that businesses that are on the list maintained by the secretary of state are eligible for a preference in state contracting and authorizes a state agency to include work performed by businesses on the list to satisfy the procurement requirements.In addition, the bill modifies the information that a business must submit with a bid to be eligible to receive the preference and modifies existing reporting requirements.(Note:  This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)Read More",Session:2016 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeTerri CarverSenatorNancy Todd

In general, if the refund is greater than 1.5% but less than 3% of the total general fund revenues, then the required transfers are halved, and if it is greater than 3%, then the required transfers are eliminated altogether.For each state fiscal year that the required transfers are reduced or eliminated,section 1of the bill adds on another year of transfers to the capital construction fund and the highway users tax fund. Therefore, there will be 5 fiscal years with the full statutory transfers to the funds, regardless of the number of fiscal years that it takes to do so.Section 2  specifies that the moneys in the state highway fund allocated from any of the statutorily required transfers to the HUTF may be used for general highway operations and maintenance.(Note:  This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)Read More",Session:2016 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeJ.

Despite program limitations that allow a senior, disabled veteran, or married couple to claim an exemption for only one primary residence even if he, she, or they own multiple residences, the audit identified several statutory and administrative process deficiencies that have made it difficult for the state to prevent individual seniors and disabled veterans and married couples from claiming and being allowed multiple exemptions and from claiming and receiving exemptions for residences other than owner-occupied primary residences. The act implements the audit recommendations as follows:The department of revenue, after receiving from the property tax administrator (administrator) a list of individuals who are claiming the exemption, must share with the administrator certain taxpayer information pertaining to the listed individuals, including their names, social security numbers, marital and income tax filing status, and residency status, needed by the administrator to prevent exemption applicants who claim multiple exemptions or exemptions for residential real property that they do not own and occupy as their primary residence from receiving the exemption;The administrator must work with the state registrar of vital statistics to annually identify individuals who have received exemptions and have died so that the administrator and county assessors can terminate exemptions for which no living individual qualifies;The scope of the administrator's exemption application review responsibilities is expanded and the timelines and process by which the review is conducted is modified in order to enhance the ability of the administrator to prevent exemptions from being erroneously allowed. The expanded review process includes an additional review of exemptions granted by counties to ensure that exemptions denied by the administrator as a result of the initial review have been removed and that no new exemptions have been added.The administrator is required to annually conduct a second review of exemptions allowed in each county for the immediately preceding property tax year, to identify any exemptions that should not have been allowed, and to advise the state treasurer to reduce the amount of reimbursement paid to each county treasurer to account for any disallowed exemptions; andIn addition, if the administrator identifies any exemption improperly allowed for a prior property tax year commencing on or after January 1, 2016, for which the state treasurer reimbursed a county treasurer or identifies any exemption properly allowed for such a prior property tax year for which the state treasurer did not reimburse a county treasurer, the administrator must advise the state treasurer to adjust the current year reimbursement to the county treasurer to correct the error.For the 2016-17 state fiscal year, $29,270 is appropriated from the general fund to the department of local affairs for use by the division of property taxation in implementing the act.(Note:  This summary applies to this bill as enacted.)Read More",Session:2016 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeDianne PrimaveraRepresentativeDan NordbergSenatorCheri  JahnSenatorTim Neville

226,HB16-1227,Exemptions Child Support Requirements Child Care Assistance,"Under current law, a county may impose as a condition of receiving low-income child care assistance under the Colorado child care assistance program (CCCAP) that an applicant who is not a Colorado works participant apply for and cooperate with child support establishment and enforcement, unless the applicant shows good cause to the county for an exemption from this requirement.The act exempts an applicant who is a teen parent, as defined by rule of the state board, from child support cooperation requirements as a condition of receiving child care assistance until the teen parent has graduated from high school or successfully completed a high school equivalency examination. After the teen parent has been determined eligible for child care assistance and his or her chosen child care provider is receiving subsidy payments, a county may require the teen parent to regularly attend, at no cost and at a location and time most convenient to the teen parent, information sessions focused on understanding the benefits of child support to the child, the family as a whole, and the benefits of two-parent engagement in a child's life. Once a person who receives child care assistance no longer meets the definition of a teen parent or has either graduated from high school or successfully completed a high school equivalency examination, the county may require that person to cooperate with child support establishment and enforcement as a condition of continued receipt of child care assistance. Nothing in the act prevents a teen parent from establishing child support.The act exempts an applicant who is a victim of domestic violence, a sexual offense, harassment, or stalking from child support cooperation requirements or from establishing good cause for not cooperating as a condition of receiving child care assistance. The act sets forth the requirements that a victim of domestic violence, a sexual offense, harassment, or stalking must establish to qualify for this exception.A county may provide information about the importance of establishing child support to a teen parent or a victim of domestic violence, a sexual offense, harassment, or stalking who chooses not to engage in child support establishment and enforcement.The state board is required to revise its rules on CCCAP to implement the exceptions from child support cooperation for teen parents and victims of domestic violence, sexual offense, harassment, or stalking.On July 1, 2017, and every July 1 thereafter through July 1, 2025, each county department shall report to the state department information related to teen parents in CCCAP.

The state department shall notify counties when the human services case management systems are functional and when the tracking of compliance will begin.The act appropriates $268,562 to the department of human services from federal child care development funds to purchase information technology services.(Note:  This summary applies to this bill as enacted.)Read More",Session:2016 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeBrian DelGrossoSenatorLarry CrowderSenatorOwen Hill

The reduction in the funded pupil count and at-risk pupil counts enabled the general assembly to reduce the dollar amount of the negative factor. Due to variations in the amounts of state aid distributed to school districts, the act decreases the minimum amount of total program funding for the 2015-16 budget year to $6,233,835,044.The act: (1) reduces the state's share of total program funding by $133,542,173, including $93,542,173 of general fund and $40,000,000 cash funds from the State Public School Fund; (2) increases the appropriation for hold-harmless full-day kindergarten funding by $49,947 cash funds from the State Education Fund; and (3) adjusts the Long Bill footnote detailing funding for the ASCENT program in FY 2015-16 to increase ASCENT per pupil funding by $23 and increase total funding dedicated to the program by $12,826 based on the increased per pupil funding.(Note:  This summary applies to this bill as enacted.)Read More",Session:2016 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeMillie HamnerSenatorPat Steadman

274,HB16-1275,Taxation Of Corp Income Sheltered In Tax Haven,"The bill pertains to an affiliated group of corporations filing a combined report. In a combined report filing, the tax is based on a percentage of the entire taxable income of all of the includable corporations, but the tax is assessed only against the corporation or corporations doing business in Colorado. Including more affiliated corporations in the combined report may result in an increase in income subject to tax.There are jurisdictions located outside of the United States with no tax or very low rates of taxation, strict bank secrecy provisions, a lack of transparency in the operation of its tax system, and a lack of effective exchange of information with other countries. There are several common legal strategies for sheltering corporate income in such jurisdictions, often called 'tax havens'.Notwithstanding a current requirement in state law that those corporations with 80% or more of their property and payroll assigned to locations outside of the United States be excluded from a combined report, the bill makes a corporation that is incorporated in a foreign jurisdiction for the purpose of tax avoidance an includable C corporation for purposes of the combined report.The bill defines a corporation incorporated in a foreign jurisdiction for the purpose of tax avoidance to mean any C corporation that is incorporated in a jurisdiction that has no or nominal effective tax on the relevant income and that meets one or more of 5 factors listed in the bill, unless it is proven to the satisfaction of the executive director of the department of revenue that such corporation is incorporated in that jurisdiction for reasons that meet the federal economic substance doctrine.The bill requires the state controller to credit a specified amount per fiscal year to the state education fund to be used to help fund public school education.The bill requires the secretary of state to submit a ballot question, to be treated as a proposition, at the statewide election to be held in November 2016 asking the voters:To increase taxes annually by the taxation of a corporation's state income that is sheltered in a foreign jurisdiction for the purpose of tax avoidance;To use the resulting tax revenue to help fund elementary and secondary public school education; andTo allow an estimate of the resulting tax revenue to be collected and spent notwithstanding any limitations in section 20 of article X of the state constitution (TABOR).(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)Read More",Session:2016 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeMike FooteRepresentativeBrittany PettersenSenatorMatt JonesSenatorKerry Donovan

If the recipient files an appeal prior to the effective date of the intended action, the recipient's medical assistance benefits will continue unchanged until the completion of the appeal process. If authorized under federal law, the department may permit a recipient's medical benefits to continue even though the appeal is filed after the effective date of the intended action. The department shall promulgate rules, consistent with federal law, that prescribe the circumstances under which the benefits may continue.The act permits an applicant or recipient to request the county or service delivery agency dispute resolution process either prior to appeal to the department or as part of the filing of the appeal. If the dispute is resolved, the county or service delivery agency will inform the applicant or recipient of the process for the dismissal of the state-level appeal.Except as provided in the act, the act requires the person or persons involved in making the decision relating to the intended action to be available for cross-examination if requested by the appellant.The act appropriates $2,500 to the department to implement the act, which money may be used for Medicaid management information system maintenance and projects.

279,HB16-1280,Update Air Ambulance Regulation,"Under current law, Colorado requires air ambulance services to be accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Medical Transport Systems (CAMTS) in order to operate legally in the state. However, some of the CAMTS standards relate to an air carrier's rates, routes, and service, which are matters that have been determined to be exclusively subject to federal, not state, regulation.The act removes direct references to CAMTS accreditation as the necessary and sufficient condition for Colorado licensure and substitutes a regulatory structure in which CAMTS accreditation is one of a number of factors considered by the department of public health and environment in its licensing decisions. Other factors relate to patient care and the health, safety, and welfare of the general public, which are matters subject to state jurisdiction.The state board of health is granted rule-making authority to set minimum standards for licensure of air ambulance services; issue provisional licenses and recognize licenses issued by other states; waive certain requirements if health and safety are not adversely affected; establish fees; and take disciplinary action, including the assessment of civil penalties, for violation of the rules.For purposes of implementation, the act appropriates $18,036 to the department of public health and environment and $3,800 to the department of law for legal services. These appropriations come from the fixed-wing and rotary-wing ambulances cash fund created in section 25-3.5-307 (2) (a), C.R.S.(Note:  This summary applies to this bill as enacted.)Read More",Session:2016 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeFaith WinterSenatorKent Lambert
280,HB16-1281,Twice Monthly Payroll System For State Employees,"Currently, the majority of state employees who are paid through the state's payroll system are paid on a monthly basis and some state employees are paid bi-weekly. Pursuant to current law, for pay periods that begin on or after July 1, 2017, all state employees who are paid through the state's payroll system will be paid twice monthly.The bill allows the state personnel director to delay the implementation date of the twice monthly payroll system if necessary due to the implementation of the new human resources information system. If there will be a delay in the implementation of the twice monthly payroll system, the state personnel director is required to notify affected employers and employees and the general assembly of the delay and of the new start date for the twice monthly payroll system.In addition, current law allows any state employee to apply to the department of personnel for a one-time loan to assist the employee in July 2017 and specifies that an employee may repay the loan either with a deduction from each paycheck for a specified period or with annual leave. The bill eliminates the option to repay the loan with annual leave.

388,HB16-1389,Safety Procedures Photos As Evidence Child Abuse,"Current law in the 'Colorado Children's Code' allows certain specified medical professionals and law enforcement officials who reasonably believe a child has been abused or neglected to take or cause to be taken color photographs of the areas of trauma visible on the child so that those photographs may be used as evidence of the child abuse or neglect.The bill amends the law to more clearly distinguish what parts of the child's body, including private areas, may be photographed and by whom. The bill also creates different standards of conduct for government employees and nongovernmental employees.Under the bill, a government employee who reasonably believes a child has been abused or neglected may take or cause to be taken color photographs of the areas of trauma or abuse visible in plain sight on the child. 'Visible in plain sight on the child'' is defined as an area of the child's body that is normally viewable by the public and that could be observed visually without removal or rearrangement of the child's clothing. 'Visible in plain sight on the child' does not include a private area of the child. The bill also defines 'private area of the child'. 'Government employee' is defined as a person employed by the government or acting under the color of state law. 'Government' is defined as the state, any county, city and county, municipality, law enforcement agency, and any school district.If a government employee reasonably believes that a private area of a child suspected of being abused or neglected needs to be examined or photographed as evidence of trauma or abuse or as evidence of the absence of trauma or abuse, the government employee shall not examine, unclothe, or rearrange clothing covering private areas, or ask the child to remove or rearrange his or her clothing covering private areas, and shall not take color photographs of the child unless the government employee has:Obtained the consent of a parent, guardian, or legal custodian of the child or obtained consent from a child who is 15 years of age or older and less than 18 years of age; orObtained a court order, if the parent, guardian, or legal custodian, or the child, if between the ages of 15 and 18, refuses to give consent, ordering that the child be presented to and examined and evaluated by an independent medical provider, a sexual assault nurse examiner (SANE), or the child's own physician; orA reasonable belief that exigent circumstances exist that constitute a medical emergency, in conjunction with a call to 911, or a reasonable suspicion that the child is in immediate threat of serious bodily injury and that the examination and photographing of the private areas of the child is reasonably necessary to treat or prevent serious bodily injury to the child.Under the bill, certain medical professionals who are not government employees and who reasonably believe a child has been abused or neglected may take or cause to be taken color photographs of the areas of trauma or abuse visible in plain sight on the child, and may take or cause to be taken color photographs of the private areas of the child if such actions:Are performed for bona fide medical purposes and in a manner that is consistent with reasonable medical practices; orAre performed with the consent of a parent, guardian, or legal custodian of the child, or with the consent of a child who is 15 years of age or older and less than 18 years of age; orAre performed pursuant to a court order, if the parent, guardian, or legal custodian, or the child, if between the ages of 15 and 18, refuses to give consent, ordering that the child be presented to and examined and evaluated by an independent medical provider, a sexual assault nurse examiner, or the child's own physician.The bill does not prevent a coroner or a medical examiner from taking color photographs of a deceased child in connection with an investigation.The state board of human services is required to adopt rules that create child safety policies and safeguards applicable to county employees and others who are taking photographs pursuant to the bill relating to the taking of photographs of the private areas of children by county employees, the security and storage of any photographs or digital images of the children, and training regarding how to conduct legal searches and the appropriateness of searches of children.(Note:  This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)Read More",Session:2016 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeJanak Joshi

The state engineer will use the streamlined process to certify water deposit applications.Individual water bank transactions will not require water court approval. However, the board's rules governing the water bank will be published before becoming effective, and a person may protest the board's rules in a water division designated by the Colorado supreme court in the same manner that a person would protest a water referee's ruling in water court.(Note:  This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)Read More",Session:2016 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeJeni James ArndtRepresentativeEdward VigilSenatorLarry Crowder

394,HB16-1395,Juvenile Delinquency Record Expungement,"Under current law, there is some access to juvenile delinquency records. The bill limits that access by making certain records public only after a court orders that a child be charged as an adult, consistent with recent changes to the direct file statute, and by eliminating the requirement that the prosecuting attorney notify the school principal of minor offenses. The bill also ensures that the juvenile and his or her attorney can access the juvenile's records, and that juvenile record information is available to agencies that require the information for research purposes, with protections against the disclosure of identifying information.Under current law, a juvenile or someone on the juvenile's behalf must petition, after an applicable waiting period of one to 5 years, for expungement. The bill requires the court to automatically expunge records in certain situations. In some situations, the juvenile must still petition for expungement. Records will be expunged immediately upon:A finding of not guilty at an adjudicatory trial;Dismissal of the entire case;Dismissal after completion of juvenile diversion, a deferred adjudication, or an informal adjustment;The completion of a sentence for a municipal offense; andThe completion of a juvenile sentence for a class 2 or 3 misdemeanor that is not a sex offense and does not involve domestic violence.Records will be eligible for expungement upon the completion of a juvenile sentence when the juvenile has a class 1 misdemeanor; a misdemeanor sex offense; a misdemeanor involving domestic violence; or a first time felony adjudication and the adjudicated felony is not a crime of violence, is not an offense involving unlawful sexual behavior, and is not a class 1 or 2 felony. The court sends a notice to the district attorney that the records are eligible for expungement. The district attorney shall notify the victim, and the victim and the district attorney have the right to object to the expungement. If there is no objection, the court enters an expungement order. If there is an objection, the court holds a hearing to determine if the juvenile is sufficiently rehabilitated and whether expungement is in the best interest of the juvenile and the community.All other juveniles must file a petition to request expungement after an applicable waiting period. Records will be eligible for expungement one year after a law enforcement contact that did not result in a referral to another agency. Records will be eligible for expungement one year from the date of the completion of a juvenile sentence if the juvenile was not adjudicated a repeat, mandatory, aggravated, or violent juvenile offender. Records will be eligible for expungement 3 years from the date of completion of a juvenile sentence if the juvenile was adjudicated a repeat or mandatory offender and not adjudicated for a felony sex offense. Records will be eligible for expungement 5 years from the date of completion of a juvenile sentence if the juvenile was adjudicated an aggravated or violent juvenile offender or was adjudicated for a felony sex offense. After the petition is filed, the court shall hold a hearing, and the court shall grant expungement if it finds that the juvenile has been rehabilitated and that expungement is in the best interest of the juvenile and the community.The bill requires written notice of the right to expungement and the process to the juvenile.(Note:  This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)Read More",Session:2016 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativePete Lee

419,HB16-1420,CO Colorado Healthcare Affordability and Sustainability Enterprise,"The bill creates the Colorado healthcare affordability and sustainability enterprise (enterprise) as atype 2agency and government-owned business within the department of health care policy and financing (HCPF) for the purpose of participating in the implementation and administration of a state Colorado healthcare affordability and sustainability program (program) on and after July 1, 2016, and creates a board consisting of 13 members appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the senate to govern the enterprise. The business purpose of the enterprise is, in exchange for the payment of a new healthcare affordability and sustainability fee (fee) by hospitals to the enterprise, to administer the program and thereby support hospitals that provide uncompensated medical services to uninsured patients and participate in publicly funded health insurance programs by:Participating in a federal program that provides additional matching money to states;Using fee revenue, which must be credited to a newly created healthcare affordability and sustainability fee fund and used solely for purposes of the program, and federal matching money to:Reduce the amount of uncompensated care that hospitals provide by increasing the number of individuals covered by publicly funded health insurance; andIncrease publicly funded insurance reimbursement rates to hospitals; andProviding or contracting for or arranging advisory and consulting services to hospitals and coordinating services to hospitals to help them more effectively and efficiently participate in publicly funded insurance programs.The bill does not take effect if the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services determine that it does not comply with federal law.The enterprise is designated as an enterprise for purposes of the taxpayer's bill of rights (TABOR) so long as it meets TABOR requirements. The primary powers and duties of the enterprise are to:Charge and collect the fee from hospitals;Leverage fee revenue collected to obtain federal matching money;Utilize and deploy both fee revenue and federal matching money in furtherance of the business purpose of the enterprise;Issue revenue bonds payable from its revenues;Enter into agreements with HCPF as necessary to collect and expend fee revenue;Engage the services of private persons or entities serving as contractors, consultants, and legal counsel for professional and technical assistance and advice and to supply other services related to the conduct of the affairs of the enterprise, including the provision of additional business services to hospitals; andAdopt and amend or repeal policies for the regulation of its affairs and the conduct of its business.The existing hospital provider fee program is repealed and the existing hospital provider fee oversight and advisory board is abolished, effective July 1, 2016. The unexpended hospital provider fee cash fund (fund)  is created, and on June 30, 2016, the state treasurer shall transfer to the fund all money in the hospital provider fee cash fund  before the cash fund is repealed, effective July 1, 2016. Money in the fund, other than fund investment interest and income that is credited to the general fund, is continuously appropriated to HCPF through October 30, 2017, for the purpose of paying claims incurred under the hospital provider fee program before its repeal. HCPF must refund any money in the fund derived from hospital provider fees that is not used to pay such claims to the hospitals that paid the fees.The bill specifies that so long as the enterprise qualifies as a TABOR-exempt enterprise, fee revenue does not count against either the TABOR state fiscal year spending limit or the referendum C cap, the higher statutory state fiscal year spending limit established after the voters of the state approved referendum C in 2005. The bill clarifies that the creation of the new enterprise to charge and collect the fee is the creation of a new government-owned business that provides business services to hospitals as an enterprise for purposes of TABOR and related statutes and does not constitute the qualification of an existing government-owned business as a new enterprise that would require or authorize downward adjustment of the TABOR state fiscal year spending limit or the referendum C cap.In order to compensate for a proposed reduction in the amount of the fiscal year 2016-17 long bill appropriation of revenue from fees collected by HCPF from hospitals and federal matching money, the bill appropriates $146,693,573 in healthcare affordability and sustainability fees and federal funds to the enterprise for fiscal year 2016-17.(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)Read More",Session:2016 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeDickey Lee HullinghorstSenatorLarry Crowder

The repeal provision was never amended, so the 2009 act repealed on September 1, 2015.The bill recreates and reenacts the 2009 act with the following modifications:School districts and institute charter schools must post on their websites, and include in district-wide or school-wide communications sent to parents and the community at large, information about the act;The Colorado state advisory council for parent involvement in education must also provide information about the act to the extent possible within existing resources; andThe act continues indefinitely and the original repeal date in the 2009 act is amended to specify that the repeal was to apply only to the 2009 act.(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)Read More",Session:2017 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeJanet BucknerSenatorAndy Kerr

472,HB17-1005,Modernize Laws Relating To Office Of State Auditor,"Statutory Revision Committee.The bill updates various statutes pertaining to the office of the state auditor (OSA).Currently, the legislative audit committee (LAC) has the discretion to direct the state auditor to conduct a performance audit of any public highway authority; except that the LAC may not do so in any year during which the interim transportation legislation review committee (TLRC) meets. However, the TLRC is statutorily required to meet every year. Consequently,section 1of the bill repeals the timing limitation so that such a performance audit can be requested at any time.The executive director of the department of revenue (DOR) is currently required to account monthly to the state treasurer regarding working capital retained by DOR and to provide copies of this accounting to the governor and the state auditor. Because DOR does not retain working capital,section 2repeals this obsolete provision. Additionally, the state treasurer must provide copies of receipts for money transmitted daily from the executive director of DOR to the state auditor, in addition to providing one copy to the executive director and retaining one copy for his or her files. Section 2 also removes the requirement to provide the state auditor these copies.Pursuant to a statute created in 1881, holders of warrants from counties with more than $50,000 in floating indebtedness may exchange those warrants for county bonds, if the exchange is approved by election. County bonds so exchanged must be registered with OSA, and a ten-cent fee must be paid to OSA for recording each bond. Because this registration provision is obsolete,section 3repeals the registration and recording fee requirements.Section 4repeals an obsolete provision relating to an audit of the estimated actual operating costs of the enhanced emissions inspections program contractor, which audit was required to be completed by the end of 2001.(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)Read More",Session:2017 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeJeni James ArndtSenatorJack Tate

518,HB17-1051,Procurement Code Modernization,"The Colorado 'Procurement Code' (code) governs how executive branch agencies, other than institutions of higher education that have opted out of the code, buy goods and services. The code is administered by the department of personnel (department) and exists to help keep the public trust, promote fair competition, make efficient use of taxpayer dollars, and allow the state to effectively do the people's business. The code has been amended many times over the years, but it has not been reviewed in total since the general assembly enacted it in 1982.General updates (Sections 5, 6, 10, 13, 15, 17 through 20, 22 through 24, 32, and 37).The code is based on the 1979 American bar association model procurement code. When the state adopted the model code, much of the structure and terminology was adopted as drafted by the American bar association rather than conforming the structure and language to the Colorado Revised Statutes. The bill updates the terminology used in the code to make it consistent with common use, simplifies reporting requirements, and reorganizes provisions of the code for ease of use. In addition, the bill clarifies the authority of the executive director of the department to promulgate rules for the administration of the code.Promulgation of rules(Sections 9, 29, 33, 35, and 59).The executive director of the department is currently required to promulgate rules in furtherance of the code. The bill makes promulgation of rules by the executive director of the department (executive director) permissive throughout the code and authorizes the director to delegate his or her authority to promulgate rules.Ethics (Sections 2 and 4).State procurement professionals follow the 'Procurement Code of Ethics and Guidelines' (guidelines), which were established by the Colorado procurement advisory council. The guidelines are often interpreted to apply only to procurement staff and not to other people involved in the procurement process. The bill clarifies that state procurement officials, end users, vendors and contractors, and interested third parties are required to adhere to ethical standards during all phases of the procurement process.Procurement training (Section 4).The bill authorizes the chief procurement officer to develop and conduct a procurement education and training program for state employees and for vendors.Application of the code (Section 3).Certain purchasing activities are currently exempt from the code, such as bridge and highway construction, the awarding of grants to political subdivisions, and procurement by institutions of higher education that have formally opted out of the code. The bill exempts the procurement of specified additional goods and services from the code.Grants (Sections 3 and 6).Currently, the application, processing, and management of grants is inconsistent across state agencies. The bill amends the definition of 'grant' to provide consistency and to comply with federal requirements including the office of management and budget uniform guidance.Multiyear contracts (Section 38).Currently, the state may enter into a contract for any period as long as the contract term is included in the solicitation. If a contract term ultimately needs to exceed the period specified in the solicitation, the contract cannot be extended and a new contract is required. The bill authorizes the state to extend an existing contract, with approval of the chief procurement officer, for a reasonable period if extenuating circumstances exist.Contract management system (Section 38).The centralized contract management system and related requirements for contract provisions, monitoring, and reporting were established for the purpose of improving the state's contracting process. The bill repeals provisions related to contract monitoring and reporting and allows for remedies, including suspension or debarment, for contractors who do not perform.Contract terms and conditions (Section 39).The process to negotiate vendor terms and conditions sometimes requires the state to agree to a requirement that the state indemnify the vendor and that the contract be governed by the vendor's choice of law rather than Colorado law. However, indemnification is in violation of the state constitution. The bill prohibits indemnification of vendors by the state and requires that state contracts be governed by Colorado law.Market research (Section 15).A request for information (RFI) is a commonly used method for obtaining information about pending procurements and doing market research. Currently, RFIs are referenced in the procurement rules but not in the code. The bill establishes an RFI process in the code as a market assessment and information gathering tool and clarifies the appropriate methods to conduct market research.Administrative remedies (Section 40 through 51).The bill clarifies the administrative remedies provisions in the code and provides guidance regarding the remedies process. Specifically, the bill clarifies who may ratify a violation of the code, specifies when a stay will apply, authorizes the executive director to refer an appeal to the office of administrative courts, and states that only material issues may be appealed.Confidentiality and CORA (Sections 7 and 21).Pursuant to current law, procurement records are public records, with some exceptions under the 'Colorado Open Records Act'. Procurement records, including bids and responses to RFIs, often contain information that is proprietary or confidential by the submitting entity. The bill clarifies that all responses to RFIs are confidential until after an award based on the RFI has been made or until the procurement official determines that the state will not pursue a solicitation based on the RFI. The bill also authorizes the executive director of the department to promulgate rules to clarify the process for classifying confidential or proprietary information.Procurement set asides, preferences, and goals (Sections 25 through 28).Current law allows a set aside in state procurement for persons with severe disabilities. The bill streamlines the process by which state agencies and nonprofit agencies that employ people with severe disabilities may use the set aside program and authorizes the executive director to promulgate rules for the administration of the program.In addition, current law contains many procurement preferences and goals; however, these preferences and goals are located in various provisions of the code and in other provisions of the Colorado Revised Statutes. The various locations of these provisions, as well as inconsistent terminology in the preference and goal provisions, make it difficult for vendors and procurement officials to know how each preference and goal should be applied. The bill relocates currently existing procurement preferences and goals into a new part and makes the language of those provisions consistent where possible.Cooperative purchasing (Section 52).Cooperative purchasing is procurement conducted by, with, or on behalf of more than one public procurement entity. It increases the opportunity for the state and local governments to obtain volume discounts through joint purchasing and it lowers the transaction costs of both purchasing agencies and vendors. The bill provides state agencies with more flexibility to use cooperative purchasing to increase efficiencies and maximize state resources.Conforming amendments (Sections 1, 8, 11, 13, 20, 30, 31, 34, 36, 53 through 58, and 60 through 75).The bill makes necessary conforming amendments.(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)Read More",Session:2017 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeBob RankinRepresentativeAlec GarnettSenatorDon CoramSenatorAndy Kerr

The warrant or order must include a finding of probable cause to search and seize or produce the electronic or wire communication. An exception to the search warrant or order requirement is established if the time required to obtain the warrant or order would result in a risk of death or substantial  bodily injury to a person or if certain persons consent to the release of the contents.The bill also excludes from its provisions situations when a peace officer may lawfully obtain the information from an electronic device in the officer's lawful possession or when only location information is sought pursuant to another statute.The bill also requires the governmental entity to give the customer notice of the search warrant and the disclosure unless the court orders that the notice need not be given due to specified circumstances.The bill prohibits any evidence obtained in violation of the bill from being introduced as evidence or used to obtain a search warrant or court order and provides immunity to an electronic communication service or remote computing service for complying with or objecting to a search warrant.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)Read More,Session:2017 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeLois Landgraf

The state treasurer is required to credit that amount to the fund, and the general assembly appropriates from the fund to the department the costs of administering moneys designated for the fund. After that amount is deducted, the moneys remaining in the fund at the end of a fiscal year are transferred to Urban Peak, a nonprofit organization.Following the statutory 2-year grace period for new tax check-offs, the fund is required to achieve the minimum contribution amount of $50,000 per year to remain on the form.(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)Read More",Session:2017 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeLeslie HerodSenatorBob Gardner

Veterans' service organizations may be organized under other provisions of the tax code such as section 501 (c)(4) or 501 (c)(19).The bill expands the criteria for organizations that may accept community or useful public service assignments to include veterans' service organizations organized under 501 (c)(4) or 501 (c)(19) of the tax code, and specifies that the court or other entity making the assignment retains discretion to determine which organizations may be included in its program of community or useful public service.Section 1amends the statute dealing with misdemeanor sentencing generally.Sections 2 and 3insert analogous provisions into the statutes dealing specifically with sentencing of persons convicted of drug offenses and alcohol-related driving offenses, respectively.(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)Read More",Session:2017 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeMike WeissmanSenatorJohn KefalasSenatorBob Gardner

533,HB17-1066,Conservation Easement Tax Credit Landowner Relief,"A state income tax credit is allowed for a portion of the value of a perpetual conservation easement that is granted by a taxpayer on real property located in Colorado. In the past, when the department of revenue disputed the validity or amount of one of these credits, a taxpayer could attempt to resolve the dispute using an administrative appeal process  within the department. If the taxpayer was not satisfied with the final determination resulting from the administrative process, the taxpayer could appeal the final determination to a district court.Starting in 2011, after a backlog of disputed conservation easement claims developed in the administrative process, the law was changed to allow taxpayers to elect to appeal directly to a district court and avoid the administrative appeal process. Unlike taxpayers who stayed in the administrative process, taxpayers who elected to appeal directly to district court were not required to provide a surety bond or other deposit in connection with their appeals, and additional interest and penalties ceased to accrue during their appeals. The bill provides that no surety bond or other deposit is required and no interest and penalties are to accrue for both the administrative appeal process and the district court appeal process.The law currently allows a conservation easement to be terminated in the same manner as any other easement. The bill specifies that, in addition, a court may exercise its equitable jurisdiction to terminate a conservation easement for which a tax credit has been claimed in certain circumstances if the claim has been rejected.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)Read More",Session:2017 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeJon BeckerRepresentativeKimmi Lewis

The maximum amount of compensatory damages for injury to property is set at $350,000 per person or $990,000 for injury to multiple persons; except that no person may recover in excess of $350,000.The bill defines a 'sanctuary jurisdiction' as a jurisdiction that adopts a law, ordinance, or policy on or after the effective date of this bill that prohibits or in any way restricts an official or employee of the jurisdiction from:Cooperating and complying with federal immigration officials or enforcing federal immigration law;Sending to or receiving from or requesting from federal immigration officials information regarding the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of an individual;Maintaining or exchanging information about an individual's immigration status, lawful or unlawful, with other federal agencies, state agencies, or municipalities;Inquiring about an individual's name, date and place of birth, and immigration status while enforcing or conducting an official investigation into a violation of any law of this state;Continuing to detain an individual, regardless of the individual's ability to be released on bail, who has been identified as an illegal alien while in custody for violating any state law; orVerifying the lawful presence and eligibility of a person applying for a state or local public benefit as required by state and federal law.The bill sets forth the requirements for determining when an illegal alien has established residency in a sanctuary jurisdiction. An 'illegal alien' is defined as a person who is not lawfully present within the United States, as determined by federal immigration law.The governing body of any jurisdiction is prohibited from adopting a law, ordinance, rule, policy, or plan or taking any action that limits or prohibits an elected official, employee, or law enforcement officer from communicating or cooperating with an appropriate public official, employee, or law enforcement officer of the federal government concerning the immigration status of an individual residing in the state. The governing body of a jurisdiction is required to provide written notice to each elected official, employee, and law enforcement officer of the jurisdiction of his or her duty to communicate and cooperate with the federal government concerning enforcement of any federal or state immigration law. The governing body of any jurisdiction in this state is required to annually submit a written report to the department of public safety (department) that the jurisdiction is in compliance with the cooperation and communication requirements. If the department does not receive those written reports, the department is required to provide the name of that jurisdiction to the state controller.A law enforcement officer of a jurisdiction who has reasonable cause to believe that an individual under arrest is not lawfully present in the United States shall immediately report the individual to the appropriate U.S. immigration and customs enforcement office (ICE) within the department of homeland security. The governing body of any jurisdiction is required to report annually to the department on the number of individuals who were reported to ICE by law enforcement officers from that jurisdiction. The department is directed to compile and submit annual reports on compliance to the general assembly and to the state controller. The state controller is required to withhold the payment of any state funds to any jurisdiction that is found by the department to have failed to comply with these reporting requirements. The state controller shall withhold funds until the department notifies the state controller that the jurisdiction is in compliance.The bill creates the crime of rendering assistance to an illegal alien through a sanctuary jurisdiction, which is a class 4 felony. A person who is an elected official of a jurisdiction commits rendering assistance to an illegal alien through a sanctuary jurisdiction if, with intent to hinder, delay, or prevent the discovery, detection, apprehension, prosecution, conviction, or punishment of illegal aliens within the jurisdiction:He or she was responsible for creating a sanctuary jurisdiction in the jurisdiction to which the official is elected; andWhen, as a result of the protection afforded by a sanctuary jurisdiction, a third person engages in criminal activity and the third person:Is an illegal alien as legally defined by federal immigration law;Had established residency in the sanctuary jurisdiction that was created by the official; andHas been convicted of a crime that caused injury to a person or to property.A person who has knowledge of a crime committed by an illegal alien as a result of the creation of a sanctuary jurisdiction may file an affidavit with the attorney general or with a district attorney outlining the crime and requesting that charges be brought or that a grand jury be impaneled. The attorney general or district attorney shall investigate and respond in writing with his or her decision to the person filing the affidavit within 49 days. If the attorney general or district attorney declines to bring charges or impanel a grand jury, the person may file a second affidavit directly with the applicable court.The bill includes a severability clause and a provision that states that the bill is not subject to judicial review.The bill takes effect upon passage and applies to acts or omissions  occurring on or after said date.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)Read More",Session:2017 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeDave WilliamsSenatorVicki Marble

The inconsistent approach of requiring it in some cases and allowing it in others has created difficulty in administering the laws, particularly when the department of revenue tried by rule to provide a consistent exception in the form of an undue hardship waiver for EFT. The bill changes the EFT and electronic filing requirements for consistency, specifying in all cases that the department may require EFT and electronic filing and that the department may promulgate rules to implement EFT and electronic filing.(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)Read More",Session:2017 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeMike FooteSenatorBob Gardner

Several rural school districts in the state have recently experienced a shortage of teachers, school bus drivers, and school food services cooks and would ideally address the shortages by hiring service retirees. PERA's employment after retirement provisions, including the limitation on the number of days in a calendar year that a service retiree may work for a PERA employer without a reduction in benefits, make it difficult for school districts to fill their vacancies with retired teachers, school bus drivers, and school food services cooks.The bill modifies the current PERA employment after retirement provisions for certain retirees hired by an employer in the school division if:The employer that hires the service retiree is a rural school district as determined by the department of education based on certain criteria and the school district enrolls 6,500 students or fewer in kindergarten through 12th grade;The school district hires the service retiree for the purpose of providing classroom instruction or school bus transportation to students enrolled by the district or for the purpose of being a school food services cook; andThe school district determines that there is a critical shortage of qualified teachers, school bus drivers, or school food services cooks, as applicable, and that the service retiree has specific experience, skills, or qualifications that would benefit the district.A service retiree who is a teacher, a school bus driver, or a school food services cook and who is hired by an employer in the school division that satisfies the criteria above may receive salary without a reduction in benefits for any length of employment in a calendar year if the service retiree has not worked for any PERA employer during the month of the effective date of retirement.In addition, the bill requires the employer that hires the service retiree to provide full payment of all PERA employer contributions, disbursements, and working retiree contributions. The bill also specifies that a service retiree who is a teacher, school bus driver, or food services cook and who is hired by an employer in the school division:Is not required to resume PERA membership;Will not receive a PERA health care premium subsidy;Is eligible to participate in the health plan offered by the employer;May not receive salary without reduction in benefits and without limitation in a calendar year for more than 6 consecutive years; andMay not be employed by the school district from which he or she retired until 2 years after retirement if he or she retired without a full service retirement benefit.By December 1, 2020, PERA is required to submit a report including specified information to the general assembly regarding the additional employment after retirement provisions for teachers, school bus drivers, and food services cooks.(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)Read More",Session:2017 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeJon BeckerRepresentativeBarbara McLachlanSenatorJerry Sonnenberg

Excess student revenue is the amount of student revenue proportionate to the time the student remained in the school before changing schools.To determine the amount of the reimbursement, the bill requires the chartering school district to prepare an accounting for each charter school of the school district at the end of the budget year. The accounting  identifies students who transferred between a charter school and a non-charter school of the school district after the pupil enrollment count day, and students who transferred from a charter school to a non-charter school of a different school district after the pupil enrollment count day.Based on the accounting, the bill requires each charter school of the school district to reimburse the chartering school district for excess student revenue for students who transferred from the charter school to a non-charter school in the chartering school district in the same budget year. The amount of the charter school's reimbursement to the chartering school district is reduced by the total amount of excess student revenue attributable to students who started in a non-charter school of the school district and transferred to the charter school in the same budget year; except that the chartering school district is not required to reimburse the charter school if the calculation results in a negative number.Further, each charter school of the school district is required to reimburse the chartering school district for excess student revenue for a student who transferred from the charter school to a non-charter school of a different school district in the same budget year.

670,HB17-1203,Local Government Special Sales Tax On Retail Marijuana,"The Colorado court of appeals has held that current law does not authorize counties to levy and collect a sales tax on retail marijuana and retail marijuana products in addition to any sales tax imposed by the state and the standard sales tax imposed by the county (special sales tax). Current law is also silent regarding the authority of a statutory municipality (municipality) to collect a special sales tax on retail marijuana and retail marijuana products. The bill authorizes counties and municipalities to levy, collect, and enforce a special sales tax on retail marijuana and retail marijuana products; except that a county may levy, collect, and enforce a special sales tax on retail marijuana and retail marijuana products only under the following circumstances:The county levies, collects, and enforces a special sales tax upon all sales of retail marijuana and retail marijuana products in the unincorporated areas of the county;The county levies, collects, and enforces a special sales tax upon all sales of retail marijuana and retail marijuana products in the municipalities within the county that do not levy a special sales tax on the sale of retail marijuana and retail marijuana products. The county special sales tax is authorized only until the municipality obtains voter approval for a special municipal tax on the sale of retail marijuana and retail marijuana products. After such time, any county special sales tax is invalid within the corporate boundaries of the municipality unless the county enters into an intergovernmental agreement with the municipality to allow the county to continue to levy, collect, and enforce the county's special sales tax.The governing body of any county and the governing body of any municipality within the boundaries of the county that levies a municipal special sales tax on the sale of retail marijuana and retail marijuana products enter into an intergovernmental agreement pertaining to the county's levy, collection, and enforcement of a special sales tax upon all sales of all retail marijuana and retail marijuana products. The intergovernmental agreement may include a provision for the apportionment of a specified percentage of the gross retail marijuana special sales tax revenue collected by the county to the municipality.The bill specifies that a county or a municipality may not levy a special sales tax under any circumstance until the proposed tax has been referred to and approved by the eligible electors of the county or municipality, as applicable. A county or municipality must refer the proposed tax to the eligible electors only on the date of the state general election, on the first Tuesday in November of an odd-numbered year, or, in the case of a municipality, on the date of a municipal biennial election.The bill specifies that if a county or municipality obtained voter approval prior to the effective date of the bill to levy, collect, and enforce a special sales tax upon the sale of retail marijuana and retail marijuana products, the tax is valid; except that, for a county, the tax is valid only so long as the county complies with the conditions specified in the bill. If the county levies, collects, and enforces such tax in a municipality that has already obtained voter approval to levy a special sales tax on the sale of retail marijuana and retail marijuana products, the county's special sales tax is invalid unless the county enters into an intergovernmental agreement with the municipality.Any special sales tax on retail marijuana and retail marijuana products shall not be collected, administered, or enforced by the department of revenue. Instead, such tax shall be collected, administered, and enforced by the county or municipality imposing the tax.A county or municipality in which the eligible electors have approved a special sales tax on the sale of retail marijuana and retail marijuana products may credit the revenues collected from the tax to the general fund of the county or municipality or to any special fund created in the county or municipality's treasury. The governing body of a county or municipality may use the revenues collected from the tax for any purpose as determined by the governing body of the county or municipality.(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)Read More",Session:2017 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeSteve LebsockSenatorBeth Martinez HumenikSenatorLarry Crowder
671,HB17-1204,Juvenile Delinquency Record Expungement,"Under current law, there is limited access to juvenile delinquency records.

The bill also ensures that the juvenile and his or her attorney can access the juvenile's records, and that juvenile record information is available to agencies that require the information for research purposes, with protections against the disclosure of identifying information.Under current law, a juvenile or someone on the juvenile's behalf must petition, after an applicable waiting period of one to 5 years, for expungement.

The prosecuting attorney shall notify the victim, and the victim and the prosecuting attorney have the right to object to the expungement. If there is no objection, the court enters an expungement order. If there is an objection, the court holds a hearing to determine if the juvenile is sufficiently rehabilitated and whether expungement is in the best interest of the juvenile and the community.Records will be eligible for expungement upon the completion of a juvenile sentence for a municipal offense 42 days after the completion of the municipal sentence. The court shall send notice to the prosecuting attorney regarding the expungement and if the prosecuting attorney files an objection within 42 days, the court shall hold a hearing.

690,HB17-1223,OSA Office of the State Auditor Fraud Hotline,"Legislative Audit Committee. Section 1of the bill requires the state auditor (auditor) to establish and administer a telephone number, fax number, email address, mailing address, or internet-based form whereby any individual may report an allegation of fraud committed by a state employee (employee) or an individual acting under a contract with a state agency (contracted individual). This system is referred to in the bill as the 'fraud hotline' or 'hotline' and any report to the hotline as a 'hotline call'.Section 1 defines 'fraud' to mean occupational fraud or the use of one's occupation for personal enrichment through the deliberate misuse or misapplication of the employing organization's resources or assets.Section 1 prohibits the auditor from disclosing publicly, or when making a referral to another state agency, the identity of any individual who contacts the fraud hotline unless the individual grants the auditor express permission to make such disclosure. These restrictions do not apply when the auditor makes a disclosure to a law enforcement agency, a district attorney, or the attorney general in connection with a criminal investigation.Under the bill, the auditor is responsible for administering the hotline, including the screening of hotline calls and consulting and coordinating with state agencies to refer allegations of fraud by an employee or contracted individual that are reported to the hotline. In connection with the administration of the hotline, the bill requires the auditor to:Publicize the existence and purpose of the hotline on the official website of the office of the state auditor; andPrepare and maintain workpapers for the purpose of documenting the activities of his or her office in connection with hotline calls and investigations.All workpapers prepared or maintained by the auditor in connection with hotline calls and investigations must be held as strictly confidential by the auditor and not for public release. These restrictions shall not prevent communication by and among the auditor, a state agency, the governor, the legislative audit committee (committee), a law enforcement agency, a district attorney, or the attorney general in accordance with the requirements of the bill. The bill specifies that all workpapers prepared or maintained by the auditor in connection with hotline calls shall not constitute public records for purposes of the 'Colorado Open Records Act'.Upon receiving a hotline call, the auditor must conduct an initial screening of the call to determine whether the matter being reported constitutes an allegation of fraud committed by an employee or a contracted individual. The auditor is required to forward all hotline calls alleging fraud by a medicaid recipient to the department of health care policy and financing and all calls alleging fraud by a medicaid provider or contractor to the medicaid fraud control unit of the office of the attorney general.If the auditor determines that a hotline call constitutes an allegation of fraud committed by an employee or contracted individual, the auditor is required to consult and coordinate with the management or designee of the affected state agency or, in the case of alleged fraud involving a gubernatorial appointee, the governor's office for the purpose of referring the hotline call and any related workpapers to the affected agency. Upon receiving a referred hotline call from the auditor, the state agency is responsible for determining and taking appropriate action to respond to the referred hotline call and reporting back to the auditor. In determining appropriate action, the state agency may request either the assistance of the auditor to participate in an investigation or request that the auditor conduct the entire investigation.When, at the request of a state agency, the auditor either participates in or conducts an investigation of a hotline call, the following additional requirements apply:The auditor is granted complete access to all of the books, accounts, reports, vouchers, or other records or information maintained by the agency that are directly related to the scope of the investigation;The auditor is required to report the results of the investigation to the head of the affected agency or, in the case of alleged fraud involving a gubernatorial appointee, to the governor's office. The auditor is also required to provide any workpapers prepared or maintained by the auditor during the investigation.If the investigation finds evidence that the amount of the alleged fraud exceeds $100,000, the auditor is also required to report the results of the investigation to the committee and, with the approval of the committee, to the governor; andIf the investigation finds evidence of apparently illegal transactions or misuse or embezzlement of public funds or property, the auditor is required to immediately report the matter to a law enforcement agency, a district attorney, or the attorney general, as appropriate.When a state agency is referred a hotline call by the auditor and has not requested that the auditor either participate in or conduct the entire investigation, the state agency is required to report back to the auditor within 90 days on the disposition of the referral, including action the agency has taken to respond to the fraud allegation and the results of any subsequent investigation by the agency. If the state agency has not reached a disposition of the referred hotline call within 90 days, the agency must report to the auditor the current status of the referral as of the 90-day deadline. This reporting requirement continues every 90 days thereafter until the agency has reached a disposition of the referred hotline call.Commencing with state fiscal year 2018-19, section 1 also requires the auditor to prepare an annual report to the committee providing an aggregate summary of activity relating to the fraud hotline during the preceding state fiscal year.Section 2adds the administration of the hotline to existing statutory provisions specifying the auditor's powers and duties.Sections 3 and 4prohibit retaliation against either a state employee or an entity under contract with a state agency resulting from the employee's disclosure of information to the hotline except where the employee discloses information with disregard for its truth or falsity.(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)Read More",Session:2017 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeLori SaineRepresentativeTracy Kraft-TharpSenatorTim NevilleSenatorCheri Jahn

Financial examinations, which the commissioner conducts on every company domiciled in Colorado once every 5 years, are intended to ensure that regulated insurance companies have proper corporate governance and internal controls and are able to pay claims. Market conduct examinations are intended to ensure that regulated insurance companies are complying with applicable laws and rules and that policyholders, providers, and beneficiaries are treated equitably.

If the business:Cures the minor violation within 30 days, the agency shall waive the penalties or fine or both; orCures the minor violation after the 30-day cure period has run, the agency may reduce the penalties or fine in full or in part.The opportunity to cure a minor violation does not apply in cases where an agency is required by statute to assess a fine for noncompliance.The bill defines 'minor violation' as a violation that:Relates to operational or administrative matters such as record keeping, retention of data, or failing to file reports or forms; andIs enforced by a fine, either in total or in the aggregate, of $500 or less; andMeets one of the following conditions:The violation relates to a rule promulgated within the 12 months immediately preceding the alleged violation; orThe violation relates to any rule and the business that has committed the minor violation has been operating as a business for less than 1 year prior to the violation. 'Minor violation' does not include:Any matter that places the safety of employees; other persons; or the public health, safety, or environment at risk; orViolations relating to:The issuance of or denial of benefits or compensation to employees; orActivities required by federal law.Each state agency shall conduct an analysis of noncompliance with its rules to identify rules with the greatest frequency of noncompliance, rules that generate the greatest amount of fines, how many first-time offenders were given the opportunity to cure a minor violation, and what factors contribute to noncompliance by regulated businesses. The agency shall consider and review what actions should be taken to address the issues identified.Any principal department that conducts an analysis of noncompliance with rules shall forward that analysis to the department of regulatory agencies, who shall compile and summarize those analyses into one combined analysis of noncompliance with rules. The department of regulatory agencies shall include that compiled analysis in its departmental presentation to the oversight legislative committee pursuant to the 'SMART Government Act'.(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)Read More",Session:2017 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeTracy Kraft-TharpRepresentativePolly LawrenceSenatorAngela WilliamsSenatorDon Coram

The bill specifies that for purposes of the assignment of a vehicle to an officer or employee of a state agency, 'state agency' does not include the judicial and legislative branches of state government, any state institution of higher education, or the Auraria higher education center, and that 'state agency' does include the state board of stock inspection commissioners.Pursuant to current law, a state agency may assign a vehicle to an officer or employee when the executive director of the state agency determines that it would promote a legitimate nonpartisan state interest, promote the efficient operation of the state motor vehicle fleet, and is cost-effective to the state agency. The bill eliminates the current criteria and specifies that a state agency may assign a vehicle to an officer or employee of the state agency for business and commuting only if:Assignment of the vehicle is necessary to conduct official and legitimate state business;The vehicle meets the federal internal revenue service (IRS) definition of qualified nonpersonal use, or assignment of the vehicle is the most cost-efficient means of transportation to the state agency; andAssignment of the vehicle complies with any additional criteria established in rules adopted by the department of personnel.The bill requires the executive director of a state agency or their designee to authorize the assignment of a vehicle in writing and submit the authorization and any supporting documentation to the director of the division for review.The bill requires the director of the division or the state controller, as applicable, to review any assignment of a vehicle to an officer or employee of the state agency. The director of the division or the state controller is required to verify that the state agency's assignment of a vehicle complies with state and federal law. If the review establishes that the assignment of a vehicle does not comply with state and federal law, the division is required to revoke the assignment of the vehicle.Currently, any state officer or employee who has an assigned vehicle is required to reimburse the state for the use of the vehicle at a rate computed by the division. The bill eliminates the reimbursement provision and specifies that when an officer or employee is assigned a vehicle because it is the most cost-efficient means of transportation to the state agency, the officer or employee is required to pay income tax on the value of the fringe benefit of the vehicle. The bill requires the state controller to calculate and report as income the value of the vehicle's fringe benefit in accordance with IRS regulations.The division is required to establish a program and adopt rules providing for annual verification by the director of the division or the state controller that the assignment of each state-owned motor vehicle to an officer or employee of a state agency still complies with the requirements of state and federal law. The review is required for all assigned vehicles, regardless of when they were assigned. If the verification process establishes that the assignment of a vehicle does not comply with state and federal law, the division is required to revoke the assignment of the vehicle.On or before September 1, 2019, the department of personnel is required to report to the legislative audit committee regarding the implementation and enforcement of the bill. The department may make recommendations regarding further modifications to the criteria and requirements for the assignment of vehicles to officers and employees of state agencies for business and commuting purposes.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)Read More",Session:2017 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeDan NordbergRepresentativeTracy Kraft-TharpSenatorJim SmallwoodSenatorCheri Jahn

767,HB17-1300,Apprentice Utilization In Public Projects,"The bill requires the contractor for any public project that does not receive any federal moneys to use apprentices registered with an apprenticeship program for at least 25% of the workforce in an apprenticeable occupation that is hired to work on the public project (apprenticeship requirements). For purposes of the bill, a public project is a project under the supervision of any state agency, including the department of transportation, that is likely to cost $500,000 or more in any fiscal year. The apprenticeship program must be registered with the United States department of labor, office of apprenticeship.A government agency may consider a bid or proposal for a public project that does not receive any federal moneys only if the bid or proposal indicates that at least 25% of the project workforce that is in an apprenticeable occupation and that is hired by the contractor to work on the public project will be apprentices registered with an apprenticeship program.Upon completion of a public project, the contractor is required to submit an affidavit to the government agency stating that the contractor has satisfied the apprenticeship requirements or made a good faith effort to comply with the apprenticeship requirements. If the contractor complied with the requirements, the affidavit must include the names of the registered apprentices, identify the specific apprenticeship programs with which the apprentices are registered, and specify the total number of people in the workforce for the public project who are in apprenticeable occupations. If the contractor was unable to comply with the apprenticeship requirements, the affidavit must include documentation of the contractor's good faith efforts to comply and the reason why compliance was not possible. If the contractor fails to submit the affidavit or if the state agency finds that the affidavit does not reflect the contractor's compliance or good faith effort to comply with the apprenticeship requirements, the agency may retain any unallocated portion of the amount of the contract price that the agency is authorized to withhold until the contract is completed as liquidated damages.A contractor that is awarded a contract by a state agency shall require, through private contract, that any subcontractor used to fulfill the terms of the contract complies with the apprenticeship requirements. The contractor may require, through private contract, that a subcontractor provide necessary information to allow the contractor to comply with the affidavit requirements.The bill specifies that the apprenticeship requirements do not supersede existing statutory requirements for licensed apprenticeable occupations.(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)Read More",Session:2017 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeAdrienne BenavidezSenatorDominick Moreno

769,HB17-1302,Juvenile Sexting Crime,"The bill creates the criminal offense of posting a private image by a juvenile. The offense can be committed in 2 ways. The first way is if a juvenile, through digital or electronic means, knowingly distributes, displays, or publishes to the view of another person a sexually explicit image of a person other than himself or herself who is at least 14 years of age or is less than 4 years younger than the juvenile:Without the depicted person's permission; orWhen the recipient did not solicit or request to be supplied with the image and suffered emotional distress; orWhen the juvenile knew or should have known that the depicted person had a reasonable expectation that the image would remain private.The second way is if the juvenile knowingly distributes, displays, or publishes, to the view of another person who is at least 14 years of age or is less than 4 years younger than the juvenile, a sexually explicit image of himself or herself when the recipient did not solicit or request to be supplied with the image and suffered emotional distress. The offense is a class 2 misdemeanor; except that it is a class 1 misdemeanor if:The juvenile committed the offense with the intent to coerce, intimidate, threaten, or otherwise cause emotional distress to the depicted person; orThe juvenile had previously posted a private image and completed a diversion program or education program for the act pursuant to the provisions of the bill or had a prior adjudication for posting a private image by a juvenile; orThe juvenile distributed, displayed, or published 3 or more images that depicted 3 or more separate and distinct persons.The bill creates the criminal offense of possessing a private image by a juvenile that prohibits a juvenile, through digital or electronic means, from knowingly possessing a sexually explicit image of another person who is at least 14 years of age or is less than 4 years younger than the juvenile without the depicted person's permission. It is not an offense if the juvenile:Took reasonable steps to either destroy or delete the image within 72 hours after initially viewing the image; orReported the initial viewing of such image to law enforcement or a school resource officer within 72 hours after initially viewing the image.The offense is a petty offense; except that it is a class 2 misdemeanor if the unsolicited possessor of the image possessed 10 or more separate images that depicted 3 or more separate and distinct persons.The bill creates a civil infraction of exchange of a private image by a juvenile if a juvenile, through digital or electronic means:Knowingly sends a sexually explicit image or images of himself or herself to another person who is at least 14 years of age or is less than 4 years younger than the juvenile, and the image or images depict only the sender and no other person and the sender reasonably believed that the recipient had solicited or otherwise agreed to the transmittal of the image or images; orKnowingly possesses a sexually explicit image or images of another person who is at least 14 years of age or is less than 4 years younger than the juvenile, and the image or images depict only the sender and no other person and the juvenile reasonably believed that the depicted person had transmitted the image or images or otherwise agreed to the transmittal of the image or images.The civil infraction can be punished by participation in a program designed by the school safety resource center or other appropriate program addressing the risks and consequences of exchanging a sexually explicit image of a juvenile or a fine of up to $50, which may be waived by the court upon a showing of indigency.If a juvenile's conduct is limited to the elements of the petty offense of possession of a private image by a juvenile or limited to the elements of the civil infraction of exchange of a private image by a juvenile, then the juvenile cannot be charged with sexual exploitation of a child. If a juvenile is charged with posting a private image by a juvenile, he or she cannot be charged with sexual exploitation of a child. The bill allows a juvenile to petition the court to not impose sex offender registration if he or she is charged with sexual exploitation of a child and the juvenile's conduct satisfies posting a private image by a juvenile or possession of a private image by a juvenile. It is an affirmative defense to the two criminal offenses and the civil infraction if a juvenile is coerced, threatened, or intimated into distributing, displaying, publishing, possessing, or exchanging a sexually explicit image of a person under 18 years of age. The court must order the records of any of the 2 criminal offenses or civil infraction expunged within 42 days of completion of the sentence or program.The bill requires the school safety resource center to make available a sexting curriculum for school districts to use.(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)Read More",Session:2017 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativePete LeeRepresentativeYeulin WillettSenatorBob GardnerSenatorRhonda Fields
770,HB17-1303,Judicial Performance Evaluation System And Commissions,"The bill addresses issues related to the state commission on judicial performance and the various district commissions on judicial performance (state commission, district commissions, or collectively all commissions), including:Procedures and duties common to all commissions are combined in a more user-friendly fashion.The current membership of all commissions is left in place as-is until January 31, 2019, at which time the governor's attorney appointment to a district commission and the chief justice's two nonattorney appointments to a district commission expire. The terms of all other existing commissioners continue until such time as the commissioner's term was originally set to expire. Beginning February 1, 2019, the membership of the commissions is structured as follows, with new appointing authorities making appointments on or before March 1, 2019:The state commission consists of 11 members, one attorney and one nonattorney each by the president of senate and speaker of the house of representatives; one nonattorney each by the minority leader of each house; two attorneys appointed by the chief justice of the supreme court; and two nonattorneys and one attorney appointed by the governor.Each district commission consists of 10 members. The make-up of each district commission is the same as that of the state commission except that the governor only appoints two nonattorneys to each district commission and makes no attorney appointment.In the case of a vacancy, the original appointing authority shall make an appointment within 45 days after the date of the vacancy. If the original appointing authority fails to fill the vacancy within 45 days, the governor shall make the appointment.Other conditions related to the membership of state and district commissioners remain as they exist in current law.Duties of all commissions are outlined. The state commission is tasked with developing uniform rules, guidelines, and procedures,, including those related to the development and distribution of surveys for persons affected by justices and judges; promulgation of rules concerning the evaluation of justices and judges, the creation of a standards matrix related to statutory performance criteria and a description of the thresholds for the recommendations of 'meets performance standard' or 'does not meet performance standard', and the continuous collection of data for use in evaluations; and the development of a systemwide judicial training program and a systemwide volunteer courtroom observer program.The state commission is tasked with developing surveys to provide to persons who are affected by justices and judges and to develop guidelines and procedures to make such surveys readily available to those persons. The state commission shall develop rules, guidelines, and procedures to provide attorneys, pro se litigants, and clients with accessible and timely opportunities to review the surveys.Current law requires the state supreme court to approve rules promulgated by the state commission. That requirement is removed. The state commission may, however, at its discretion and within existing appropriations and resources, retain independent legal counsel to review any rules, guidelines, or procedures adopted. The state commission shall post a notice of any proposed rule, guideline, or procedure, allow for a period for public comment, and give the public the opportunity to address the state commission at a public hearing on the proposed rule, guideline, or procedure.The bill adds retired judges who have returned to temporary judicial duties per contract with the judicial department, as allowed by statute, also referred to as senior judges, to the list of judges that commissions are to evaluate. Every third year following the initial appointment of a senior judge to the bench through a contract, the state commission shall conduct a performance evaluation of such judge. The performance evaluation shall be completed and communicate the related narrative to the chief justice no later than 45 days prior to the expiration of the senior judge's contract for that year.Judicial performance evaluation criteria is retained, as is the requirement for all commissions to perform election-retention-year evaluations as well as initial and interim evaluations. Narratives and recommendations stemming from such evaluations are still required.The option to develop an individual improvement plan (improvement plan) for a justice or judge is authorized. If the state or a district commission recommends that a justice or judge receive an improvement plan, the commission shall communicate that recommendation to the chief justice or appropriate chief judge. The chief justice or chief judge shall then develop an improvement plan for the justice or judge in question and forward such improvement plan to the state commission for review. After the state commission reviews and approves an improvement plan, the chief justice or chief judge has the responsibility for implementing the improvement plan. A copy of the improvement plan and a statement of the results of such plan will be maintained in the appropriate commission's files. If a justice or judge is required to complete an improvement plan and he or she fails to satisfactorily do so, the appropriate commission shall automatically issue a 'does not meet performance standard' designation on his or her performance evaluation summary.The state commission is required to gather and maintain statewide data and post a report of the data on its website at least 30 days prior to each retention election; andBeginning in January 2019, and every 2 years thereafter, the judicial department shall include a summary of the commissions' activities in the department's 'State Measurement for Accountable, Responsive, and Transparent (SMART) Government Act' presentation to the joint judicial committee.A private right of action is established in which final actions of the state commission are subject to judicial review if a person is adversely affected or aggrieved by such final action. A 'final action' for purposes of the private right of action is defined as a rule, guideline, or procedure adopted by the state commission. A 'final action' does not include a final recommendation regarding a justice or a judge, an improvement plan, surveys developed by the state commission, or any aspect of an individual justice's or judge's judicial performance evaluation.(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)Read More",Session:2017 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeCole WistRepresentativePete LeeSenatorBob GardnerSenatorDaniel Kagan

806,HB17-1339,Colorado Energy Impact Assistance Act,"The bill, known as the 'Colorado Energy Impact Assistance Act', authorizes any investor-owned electric utility (utility) to apply to the public utilities commission (PUC) for a financing order that will authorize the utility to issue low-cost Colorado energy impact assistance bonds (bonds) to lower the cost to electric utility customers (ratepayers) when the retirement of a power plant occurs. A portion of bond proceeds will provide transition assistance for Colorado workers and communities directly affected by the retirement of the facilities (transition assistance). To repay the bonds at the lowest cost to ratepayers, the PUC is authorized to review and approve a financing order and authorize a special energy impact assistance charge that is separate and apart from the utility's base rates on all ratepayer bills. The establishment and ongoing adjustment of the separate charge will allow bonds to achieve the highest possible credit rating, at least AA/Aa2, from the national independent credit rating agencies and will therefore allow bonds to be issued at the lowest possible interest rate and lowest subsequent cost to ratepayers.Before issuing a financing order, the PUC must hold a public hearing, receive testimony from affected groups, and make specified determinations concerning the necessity, prudence, justness, reasonableness, and quantifiable benefits to utility ratepayers of issuing the financing order. After the public hearing process, if a financing order is approved by the PUC, it must include specific information and instructions for the utility to which it applies relating to the amount of bonds to be issued and the imposition of the energy impact assistance charge and must require the utility to pay a specified percentage of the net present value of the savings to a newly created Colorado energy impact assistance authority (authority) for the payment of transition assistance by the authority and the authority's reasonable and necessary administrative and operating costs. As an alternative to the financing order and bond issuance process, upon the closure of an electric generating facility, a Colorado electric utility may transfer to the authority an amount of up to 15% of the net present value of operational savings created by the closure of the electric generating facility, and such a transfer shall be deemed by the PUC to be a prudent action by the utility.The bill specifies that the authority is governed by a 7-member board of directors appointed by the governor and specifies mandatory and suggested occupational experience for the directors. The authority is authorized to receive bond proceeds from a utility to which a financing order applies and use the bond proceeds to provide transition assistance and pay its reasonable and necessary administrative and operating costs.Transition assistance is defined to include payment of retraining costs, including costs of apprenticeship programs and skilled worker retraining programs, for and financial assistance to directly displaced Colorado facility workers, compensation to Colorado local governments for lost property tax revenue directly resulting from the retirement of a facility, and similar payments, job retraining, assistance, and compensation for directly displaced Colorado workers and local governments in areas that produce fuel used in the retired facility directly resulting from the elimination of the need for fuel at the facility. When determining how best to provide transition assistance to a local community, the authority must, in conjunction with each board of county commissioners, municipal governing body, and school district that includes all or a portion of the impacted community, establish and take into consideration the advice of a local advisory committee. The authority is subject to open meeting and open records requirements and is required to submit a report to specified committees of the general assembly that sets forth a complete and detailed financial and operating statement of the authority for any fiscal year for which the authority has provided transition assistance.(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)Read More",Session:2017 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeChris HansenRepresentativeDaneya EsgarSenatorAndy KerrSenatorMatt Jones

965,HB18-1122,Accounting Of Conservation Easements In The State,"A conservation easement is an agreement in which a property owner agrees to limit the use of his or her land in perpetuity in order to protect one or more specified conservation purposes. The instruments creating the easement are recorded in the public records affecting the ownership of the property. The easement is held by a third party (holder), which monitors the use of the land and ensures that the terms of the  agreement are upheld.Current law allows a taxpayer to claim a state income tax credit for a portion of the value of a perpetual conservation easement that is granted by the taxpayer on real property located in the state. The aggregate amount of credits that may be claimed each year by all taxpayers is capped at $45 million; except that the amount of credits allowed in recent years has been substantially lower than that amount.There is currently no centralized public source of information to identify the number, size, location, or validity of conservation easements in the state and whether the conservation purposes of the easements are being monitored and defended. The bill requires a comprehensive accounting of the conservation easements that have been created in the state since 1998. The state auditor shall contract with an independent contractor to perform the accounting. The accounting includes information about the instruments creating each easement, the size and location of each easement, the grantors and holders of each easement, tax credits claimed for the donation of each easement, and whether the conservation purposes of each easement are being protected. The accounting includes the creation of a corresponding map showing the location of each conservation easement in the state.Certain public entities are encouraged to provide information and input into the preparation of the accounting. The state auditor is directed to review the accounting and present it at a public meeting to the legislative audit committee by a specified date.

1021,HB18-1178,Hold Colorado Governments Accountable Sanctuary Jurisdictions,"The bill is a referred measure to be voted upon at the election on November 6, 2018. It is known as the 'Colorado Politician Accountability Act'. The bill includes a legislative declaration that states that addressing sanctuary jurisdictions is a matter of statewide concern and that makes findings about how sanctuary policies are contrary to federal law and state interests.The bill creates a civil remedy against the state or a political subdivision of the state (jurisdiction) and against its elected officials for creating sanctuary policies. The bill also creates a crime of rendering assistance to an illegal alien that can be brought against an elected official for creating a sanctuary jurisdiction.An elected official is responsible for the creation of a sanctuary jurisdiction if the elected official votes in favor of imposing or creating a law, ordinance, or policy that allows the jurisdiction to operate as a sanctuary jurisdiction; fails to take steps to try to change a law, ordinance, or policy that allows the jurisdiction to operate as a sanctuary jurisdiction; or is a county sheriff who imposes or enforces a policy that allows the jurisdiction to operate as a sanctuary jurisdiction in a county in which the elected officials have not voted to impose or create a sanctuary jurisdiction.The bill allows any person who claims that he or she is a victim of any crime committed by an illegal alien who established residency in a sanctuary jurisdiction to file a civil action for compensatory damages against a jurisdiction and against the elected officials of the jurisdiction who were responsible for creating the policy to operate as a sanctuary jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the protections of the 'Colorado Governmental Immunity Act', the jurisdiction and its officials who are responsible for creating a sanctuary jurisdiction are civilly liable for damages if the person who engaged in the criminal activity:Is determined to be an illegal alien;Had established residency in the sanctuary jurisdiction; andIs convicted of the crime that is a proximate cause of the injury to a person or property.The maximum amount of compensatory damages for injury to persons is $700,000 per person or $1,980,000 for injury to 2 or more persons; except that no person may recover in excess of $700,000. The maximum amount of compensatory damages for injury to property is set at $350,000 per person or $990,000 for injury to multiple persons; except that no person may recover in excess of $350,000.The bill defines a 'sanctuary jurisdiction' as a jurisdiction that adopts a law, ordinance, or policy on or after the effective date of the bill that prohibits or in any way restricts an official or employee of the jurisdiction from:Cooperating and complying with federal immigration officials or enforcing federal immigration law;Sending to or receiving from or requesting from federal immigration officials information regarding the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of an individual;Maintaining or exchanging information about an individual's immigration status, lawful or unlawful, with other federal agencies, state agencies, or municipalities;Inquiring about an individual's name, date and place of birth, and immigration status while enforcing or conducting an official investigation into a violation of any law of this state;Continuing to detain an individual, regardless of the individual's ability to be released on bail, who has been identified as an illegal alien while in custody for violating any state law; orVerifying the lawful presence and eligibility of a person applying for a state or local public benefit as required by state and federal law.The bill sets forth the requirements for determining when an illegal alien has established residency in a sanctuary jurisdiction. An 'illegal alien' is defined as a person who is not lawfully present within the United States, as determined by federal immigration law.The governing body of any jurisdiction is prohibited from adopting a law, ordinance, rule, policy, or plan or taking any action that limits or prohibits an elected official, employee, or law enforcement officer from communicating or cooperating with an appropriate public official, employee, or law enforcement officer of the federal government concerning the immigration status of an individual residing in the state. The governing body of a jurisdiction is required to provide written notice to each elected official, employee, and law enforcement officer of the jurisdiction of his or her duty to communicate and cooperate with the federal government concerning enforcement of any federal or state immigration law. The governing body of any jurisdiction in this state is required to annually submit a written report to the department of public safety (department) that the jurisdiction is in compliance with the cooperation and communication requirements. If the department does not receive those written reports, the department is required to provide the name of that jurisdiction to the state controller.A law enforcement officer of a jurisdiction who has reasonable cause to believe that an individual under arrest is not lawfully present in the United States shall immediately report the individual to the appropriate U.S. immigration and customs enforcement office (ICE) within the department of homeland security. The governing body of any jurisdiction is required to report annually to the department on the number of individuals who were reported to ICE by law enforcement officers from that jurisdiction. The department is directed to compile and submit annual reports on compliance to the general assembly and to the state controller. The state controller is required to withhold the payment of any state funds to any jurisdiction that is found by the department to have failed to comply with these reporting requirements. The state controller shall withhold funds until the department notifies the state controller that the jurisdiction is in compliance.The bill creates the crime of rendering assistance to an illegal alien through a sanctuary jurisdiction, which is a class 4 felony. A person who is an elected official of a jurisdiction commits rendering assistance to an illegal alien through a sanctuary jurisdiction if, with intent to hinder, delay, or prevent the discovery, detection, apprehension, prosecution, conviction, or punishment of illegal aliens within the jurisdiction:He or she was responsible for creating a sanctuary jurisdiction in the jurisdiction to which the official is elected; andWhen, as a result of the protection afforded by a sanctuary jurisdiction, a third person engages in criminal activity and the third person:Is an illegal alien as legally defined by federal immigration law;Had established residency in the sanctuary jurisdiction that was created by the official; andHas been convicted of a crime that caused injury to a person or to property.A person who has knowledge of a crime committed by an illegal alien as a result of the creation of a sanctuary jurisdiction may file an affidavit with the attorney general or with a district attorney outlining the crime and requesting that charges be brought or that a grand jury be impaneled. The attorney general or district attorney shall investigate and respond in writing with his or her decision to the person filing the affidavit within 49 days. If the attorney general or district attorney declines to bring charges or impanel a grand jury, the person may file a second affidavit directly with the applicable court.The bill includes a severability clause and a provision that states that the bill is not subject to judicial review.If approved by the voters, the bill takes effect on the date of the proclamation by the governor and applies to acts or omissions occurring and offenses committed on or after said date.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)Read More",Session:2018 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeDave WilliamsSenatorKevin LundbergSenatorVicki Marble

Accordingly, state law had allowed the department of transportation (CDOT) to prepare a waiver valuation for real property with an anticipated value of $25,000 or less when valuing real property that it seeks to acquire.

1198,HB18-1355,Public Education Accountability System,"Accreditation - criteria - community meetings - performance watch - performance indicators - school transformation grant program.The act changes the criteria that the department of education (department) must consider in assigning an accreditation category to a school district or the state charter school institute (institute) or in recommending the type of performance plan that a public school must implement. The act clarifies that a school district or the institute, on its own behalf or on behalf of one of its public schools, may request reconsideration of the initial accreditation category or performance plan assignment. The act specifies criteria the department may apply as part of the reconsideration.The act directs the department to make training in governance and turnaround best practices available to the directors of the board of education of a school district that is accredited with improvement plan or lower or that includes a public school that is required to implement a priority improvement or turnaround plan and to make materials and training available to parents, school personnel, and school district and school accountability committees. The act allows, rather than requires, the commissioner of education (commissioner) to assign the state review panel to evaluate a school district's, the institute's, or a public school's turnaround plan. And the commissioner may require the state review panel to conduct one or more on-site visits as part of the evaluation.In the third year in which a school district or the institute is accredited with priority improvement plan or lower, or earlier at the school district's or institute's request, the school district or institute must hold a parent and community meeting. Department personnel must attend the meeting. The act specifies the information that must be provided at the meeting and the requirements for providing notice of the meeting. A school district or the institute, as appropriate, must also hold a parent and community meeting for a public school that is in the third year of implementing a priority improvement or turnaround plan, or earlier, and must combine the parent and community meeting with the public meeting required by statutes existing before passage of the act. If the public meeting concerns a charter school, the governing board of the charter school must consent to holding the meeting earlier than the third year. Department personnel must attend the meeting. The department may require a school district or an institute charter school to provide proof of compliance with other public meeting requirements that apply to adoption of a priority improvement or turnaround plan.Before passage of the act, if a school district or the institute was accredited with priority improvement plan or lower for 5 consecutive years, the department could recommend that the state board of education (state board) remove the school district's or institute's accreditation. The act changes the time period, beginning with the 2018-19 school year, by providing that, if a school district or the institute performs at a level that results in being accredited with priority improvement plan or lower for 2 consecutive years followed by 3 additional years, consecutive or nonconsecutive, for a total of 5 years, the state board shall require the school district or institute to take action as provided in statute. But if the school district or institute performs at a level that results in being accredited at a level higher than priority improvement plan for 2 consecutive years after the first 2 of the 5 years, then the 5 years stop accumulating. This change to calculating the 5 years also applies to a public school that performs at a level that results in being required to adopt a priority improvement or turnaround plan. While the 5 years are accumulating, the school district, institute, or public school is on performance watch. For the fourth year in which a public school, a school district, or the institute is on performance watch, the priority improvement or turnaround plan adopted by the public school, school district, or institute must include a description of how it would implement the actions that the state board may direct at the completion of 5 years on performance watch.The act also changes the consequences for completing 5 years on performance watch. Under the act, the commissioner must assign the state review panel to evaluate the school district's or the institute's performance and recommend one or more of several specified actions, which may include removal of accreditation. After considering the recommendations, the state board must determine the appropriate actions and direct the school district or institute accordingly. The school district or institute then goes on a 2-year cycle of evaluation by the state review panel, which may result in additional directions from the state board to the school district or institute. The school district or institute remains subject to the 2-year cycle until it performs at a level that results in being accredited with improvement plan or higher for 2 consecutive years. A comparable requirement for a 2-year cycle of review by the state review panel applies to a public school that completes 5 years on performance watch.The act clarifies that the state board, at the request of a school district or the institute, may direct the school district or institute to take one of the specific actions, for itself or for a public school, before the school district, institute, or public school completes the 5 years on performance watch. If the direction concerns a charter school, the governing board of the charter school must consent to taking action before completion of the 5 years.The act makes several changes to the performance indicators for measuring the performance of public schools, school districts, the institute, and the state, including:Repealing the specific details for calculating performance of the achievement and longitudinal growth indicators and directing the state board to specify calculations in rule;Creating a performance indicator that measures growth to standards; andRemoving the performance indicator concerning closing the achievement gaps and requiring the department to disaggregate performance by student groups in each of the remaining performance indicators and separately account for the performance of each student group on each performance indicator.The act requires the annual performance reports for public schools, school districts, the institute, and the state to specify the percentage of students enrolled by each public school, school district, or the institute who score at each of the performance levels on the statewide assessments.The act changes the existing school turnaround leaders development program to the school transformation grant program. Under the school transformation grant program, in addition to awarding grants for the development of school turnaround leaders, the state board must award grants to applying school districts, the institute, and charter schools for educator professional development and to implement instructional transformation in the public schools.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as enacted.)Read More",Session:2018 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeBrittany PettersenRepresentativeLang SiasSenatorBob GardnerSenatorDominick Moreno

1317,HB19-1033,Local Governments May Regulate Nicotine Products,"Regulation of cigarettes, tobacco products, or nicotine products - local government regulation - state cigarette tax revenue apportionment to local governments - local governments' special sales taxes.Sections 1, 2, and 4 of the act authorize a county to enact a resolution or ordinance that prohibits a minor from possessing or purchasing cigarettes, tobacco products, or nicotine products. Sections 1 and 2 also authorize a county to impose regulations on cigarettes, tobacco products, or nicotine products that are more stringent than statewide regulations, including prohibiting sales to a person under 21 years of age, and section 4 expressly authorizes a county to enact a resolution or ordinance regulating the sale of cigarettes, tobacco products, or nicotine products to minors. Section 3 expressly authorizes a statutory or home rule city or town to enact an ordinance regulating the sale of cigarettes, tobacco products, or nicotine products to minors.From state income tax money, the state currently apportions an amount equal to 27% of state cigarette tax revenues to cities, towns, and counties in proportion to the amount of state sales tax revenues collected within their boundaries.

1321,HB19-1037,Colorado Energy Impact Assistance Act,"The bill, known as the ""Colorado Energy Impact Assistance Act"", authorizes any electric utility (utility) to apply to the public utilities commission (PUC) for a financing order that will authorize the utility to issue low-cost Colorado energy impact assistance bonds (bonds) to lower the cost to electric utility customers (ratepayers) when the retirement of an electric generating facility occurs. A utility that issues bonds in conjunction with the retirement of an electric generating facility may apply to the PUC for approval to replace the retired electric generating facility with cost-effective generation resources or energy storage facilities, the granting of which by the PUC is subject to specified requirements and limitations.A portion of bond proceeds will provide transition assistance for Colorado workers and communities directly affected by the retirement of the facilities (transition assistance). To repay the bonds at the lowest cost to ratepayers, the PUC is authorized to review and approve a financing order and authorize a special energy impact assistance charge that is separate and apart from the utility's base rates on all ratepayer bills. The establishment and ongoing adjustment of the separate charge will allow bonds to achieve the highest possible credit rating, at least AA/Aa2, from the national independent credit rating agencies and will therefore allow bonds to be issued at the lowest possible interest rate and lowest subsequent cost to ratepayers.Before issuing a financing order, the PUC must hold a public hearing, receive testimony from affected groups, and make specified determinations concerning the necessity, prudence, justness, reasonableness, and quantifiable benefits to utility ratepayers of issuing the financing order. After the public hearing process, if a financing order is approved by the PUC, it must include specific information and instructions for the utility to which it applies relating to the amount of bonds to be issued and the imposition of the energy impact assistance charge and must require the utility to pay 15% of the net present value of the savings to a newly created Colorado energy impact assistance authority (authority) for the payment of transition assistance by the authority and the authority's reasonable and necessary administrative and operating costs. As an alternative to the financing order and bond issuance process, upon the closure of an electric generating facility, a Colorado electric utility may transfer to the authority an amount of up to 15% of the net present value of operational savings created by the closure of the electric generating facility, and such a transfer shall be deemed by the PUC to be a prudent action by the utility.The bill specifies that the authority is governed by a 7-member board of directors appointed by the governor and specifies mandatory and suggested occupational experience for the directors. The authority is authorized to receive bond proceeds from a utility to which a financing order applies and use the bond proceeds to provide transition assistance and pay its reasonable and necessary administrative and operating costs.Transition assistance is defined to include payment of retraining costs, including costs of apprenticeship programs and skilled worker retraining programs, for and financial assistance to directly displaced Colorado facility workers, compensation to Colorado local governments for lost property tax revenue directly resulting from the retirement of a facility, and similar payments, job retraining, assistance, and compensation for directly displaced Colorado workers and local governments in areas that produce fuel used in the retired facility directly resulting from the elimination of the need for fuel at the facility. The authority must disburse at least 50% of the transition assistance that it provides directly to Colorado workers; except that, if the local advisory committee established by the authority as required by the bill determines that the disbursement of 50% of all transition assistance directly to Colorado workers would be excessive based on the amount of transition assistance available and the amount of need for such direct assistance and recommends that a lower percentage of all transition assistance be disbursed directly to Colorado workers, the authority may reduce the percentage of all transition assistance disbursed directly to Colorado workers below50% to any percentage not less than 30%. When determining how best to provide transition assistance to a local community, the authority must, in conjunction with each board of county commissioners, municipal governing body, and school district that includes all or a portion of the impacted community, establish and take into consideration the advice of a local advisory committee. The authority is subject to open meeting and open records requirements and is required to submit a report to specified committees of the general assembly that sets forth a complete and detailed financial and operating statement of the authority for any fiscal year for which the authority has provided transition assistance.(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)Read More",Session:2019 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeChris HansenRepresentativeDaneya EsgarSenatorKerry Donovan

HPTE is not authorized to impose the access fee upon the registration of a vehicle registered for a registration period beginning on or after July 1, 2020, but before July 1, 2022, but, upon the registration of a vehicle for such a registration period, the owner of an eligible plug-in electric motor vehicle may choose to apply for the right to operate the vehicle for free on any express lane that is a high occupancy vehicle lane without regard to the number of persons in the vehicle and for a reduced toll on any express lane that is a toll lane or a high occupancy toll lane.A plug-in electric motor vehicle is an ""eligible plug-in electric motor vehicle"" if it is being registered for its 1st, 2nd, or 3rd registration period under the ownership of the same owner and if making the vehicle eligible would not cause the total number of eligible vehicles to exceed a specified cap that increases annually for 5 years until reaching a permanent maximum amount. ""Express lane"" is defined to include any high occupancy vehicle lane, toll lane, or high occupancy toll lane that HPTE, a private partner of HPTE, or HPTE in conjunction with a private partner of HPTE or the department of transportation (CDOT) operates and maintains or that HPTE designates as an express lane, which currently includes:Operating express lanes on Interstate Highway 25 between downtown Denver and 120th Avenue, on Interstate Highway 70 between Idaho Springs and Empire, and on U.S. Highway 36 between Denver and Boulder; andPlanned express lanes on: (1) Interstate Highway 25 between 120th Avenue and State Highway E-470, Johnstown and Fort Collins, and Monument and Castle Rock; (2) Interstate Highway 70 between Interstate Highway 25 and Chambers Road; and (3) State Highway C-470 between Interstate Highway 25 and Wadsworth Boulevard.Each county clerk and recorder, acting as an authorized agent of the department of revenue, is required to collect the access fee, and access fee revenue is credited to the statewide transportation enterprise special revenue fund for use by HPTE. The owner of an eligible plug-in electric motor vehicle may choose not to pay the access fee, but must pay the fee to be authorized to operate the vehicle for free on any express lane that is a high occupancy vehicle lane and for a reduced toll on any express lane that is a toll lane or a high occupancy toll lane, without regard to the number of persons in the vehicle. If the free or reduced toll use of express lanes by eligible plug-in electric motor vehicles is determined to cause a decrease in the level of service for other bona fide users of the express lanes so that CDOT or HPTE is violating or will violate within the next 3 months contractual level of service guarantees or will be unable to satisfy debt service coverage requirements, then CDOT may restrict or eliminate free and reduced toll use of the express lanes by eligible plug-in electric motor vehicles for as long as the violation or inability is expected to continue. CDOT is required to report annually during its ""State Measurement for Accountable, Responsive, and Transparent (SMART) Government Act"" hearing regarding the actual and projected free and reduced toll use of express lanes by eligible plug-in electric vehicles and any actions that it has taken or expects to take to restrict, limit, or restore such use.The existing authorization for a limited number of inherently low-emission vehicles or hybrid vehicles to use express lanes without regard to the number of persons in the vehicle and without paying a toll expires for each participating vehicle on the date of the first registration of the vehicle for a registration period that begins on or after July 1, 2022.The department of revenue and CDOT are required to coordinate to establish electronic processes that:Automatically notify HPTE and, if deemed necessary by  HPTE, any private partner of HPTE that operates an express lane, when the owner of a plug-in electric motor vehicle pays the access fee so that HPTE, directly or through its private partners, can successfully administer and enforce the conditions of access for eligible plug-in electric motor vehicles to express lanes; andAutomatically notify each authorized agent when the access fee can or cannot be collected in accordance with the limitation on the number of eligible plug-in electric motor vehicles.CDOT is authorized to promulgate administrative rules to ensure proper implementation, administration, and enforcement of the conditions of access for eligible plug-in electric motor vehicles to express lanes.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)Read More",Session:2019 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeAlex ValdezSenatorBrittany PettersenSenatorFaith Winter

1601,HB19-1317,Income Tax Credit And Senior Property Tax Exemption,"The state constitution authorizes the general assembly to lower the maximum amount of the actual residential value of residential real property that is subject to the senior property tax exemption (exemption).Section 3of the bill lowers the maximum amount to $0 for all property tax years beginning on and after January 1, 2020, which has the effect of eliminating the exemption. It does not affect the property tax exemption for disabled veterans. Undersection 4, a county assessor is no longer required to mail notices to seniors about the exemption, and undersection 5, an assessor is not required to accept applications or otherwise administer the exemption unless and until the general assembly enacts legislation to increase the maximum actual value of residential real property that is subject to the exemption. If the exemption is made available in the future, seniors must reapply for it.Section 6creates an income tax credit that is available for 10 tax years beginning on January 1, 2020, for a qualifying senior. A qualifying senior must be 65 years of age or older at the end of the income tax year for which the credit is claimed and have income that is less than or equal to $65,000, adjusted for inflation, or a surviving spouse who is at least 58 and meets the same income qualification.If the qualifying senior's adjusted gross income for the taxable year is less than or equal to the base income amount, which is $12,000, adjusted for inflation, then the credit is equal to the maximum credit amount, which is $700, adjusted for inflation. The amount of the credit decreases by $50, adjusted for inflation, for each income grouping above the base income amount. The amount of the credit that exceeds the qualifying senior's income taxes due is refunded to the qualifying senior.Section 6also creates the credit stabilization cash fund. The state treasurer is annually required to transfer money from the cash fund to the general fund, or vice versa, depending on whether the total amount of the credits exceeds an approximation of what the state would have had to pay to backfill the senior homestead exemption.If some or all of the credit is paid to the senior as a state income tax refund, and therefore taxable income,section 7allows a qualifying senior to deduct an amount equal to the refundable amount of the credit from taxable income for purposes of determining state income taxes.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)Read More",Session:2019 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeChris KennedyRepresentativeMike WeissmanSenatorLois Court

1617,HB19-1333,Cigarette Tobacco & Nicotine Products Tax,"The bill refers a ballot issue to the voters at the November 2019 statewide election for the following tax increases:To increase the cigarette tax by 8.75 cents per cigarette;To increase the tobacco products tax by 22% of the manufacturer's list price; andTo create a tax on nicotine products that is equal to 62% of the manufacturer's list price, which is the same total tax as the tax levied on tobacco products with the increase.If voters approve the tax, then the state will have the authority to impose these taxes and retain and spend the revenue as a voter-approved revenue change, and the remainder of the bill takes effect upon approval.The new nicotine products tax is modeled after the tobacco products tax. Nicotine products are products that contain nicotine and that are ingested into the body, which at this time is typically through vaping with an electronic cigarette. The excise tax is levied on the sale, use, consumption, handling, or distribution of all nicotine products in the state, and it is imposed on a distributor at the time the product is brought into the state, made here, or shipped or transported to retailers in the state. If a distributor fails to pay the tax, then any person or entity in possession of the nicotine products is liable for the tax.To be a distributor of nicotine products, a person must have a license. The license costs $10 per year and requires that the distributor must have a tax license and comply with all of the laws relating to the collection of the tax. Distributors are required to file quarterly returns, and the department of revenue (department) may require electronic fund transfers of the taxes paid. Licensees are required to maintain certain records, and retailers are likewise required to maintain records about nicotine products it purchases from a licensed distributor. The department may share the names and addresses of persons who purchased nicotine products for resale with the department of public health and environment and county and district public health agencies.To account for the increased taxes per cigarette, the discount percentage on cigarette stamps that a cigarette wholesaler may retain for its collection costs is reduced from 4% to .4% and the similar discount for a tobacco products distributor is reduced from 3.33% to 1.6%. A nicotine products distributor will be permitted to retain 1.1% of the taxes collected.In general, 50% of the revenue from the new nicotine products tax and the additional cigarette and tobacco products taxes (new tax revenue) is allocated for purposes related to health care, and 50% is allocated for preschool programs and expanded learning opportunities. Specifically, the new tax revenue is deposited in the old age pension fund and then credited to the general fund in accordance with the state constitution. The state treasurer is then required to transfer 50% of the new tax revenue from the general fund to the behavioral health and health care affordability and accessibility cash fund (behavioral health fund).The state treasurer is further required to transfer money in the behavioral health fund as follows:19%, up to $30 million, to the tobacco education programs fund, which is primarily used for tobacco education, prevention, and cessation programs, which are expanded to include nicotine products; and9.5%, up to $15 million, to offset the decreased revenue from the existing taxes that may result from the voter-approved rate increases, and of this amount, 73% is further allocated to the tobacco tax cash fund and 27% to the general fund.For fiscal years that begin prior to July 1, 2023, the general assembly is required to appropriate the remainder of the money in the behavioral health fund as follows:66% to make health care more affordable and accessible; and34% to improve the provision of behavioral health services for children and youth.Thereafter, the specific allocation no longer applies and the only limitation on appropriating for these 2 purposes is that each purpose must receive at least 20% of the fund remainder.The state treasurer is required to transfer the other 50% of the new tax revenue to the newly created preschool programs cash fund, from which money is appropriated to the department of education to improve the availability, affordability, and quality of voluntary early childhood education, and to the Colorado expanded learning opportunities cash fund, from which money is used for the Colorado expanded learning opportunities program. The allocation of the new tax revenue between the 2 funds is as follows:For the 2019-20 and 2020-21 fiscal years, 35% to the preschool programs cash fund and 15% to the Colorado expanded learning opportunities cash fund;For the 2021-22 fiscal year, 30% to the preschool programs cash fund and 20% to the Colorado expanded learning opportunities cash fund; andFor the 2022-23 fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter, 27.5% to the preschool programs cash fund and 22.5% to the Colorado expanded learning opportunities cash fund.The state auditor is required to annually conduct a financial audit of the use of the new tax revenue.The bill also creates the Colorado expanded learning opportunities program, which is established to allow eligible students to participate in out-of-school learning experiences. The Colorado expanded learning opportunities agency, which is an independent agency in the department of education, through an administering nonprofit, pays providers for eligible students to participate in such experiences.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)Read More",Session:2019 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeYadira CaraveoSenatorRhonda Fields

1643,HB20-1024,Net Operating Loss Deduction Modifications,"Colorado taxpayers can claim a net operating loss deduction on their Colorado tax return. Unless statute otherwise provides, the state deduction is currently allowed in the same manner that a similar deduction is allowed under the internal revenue code to determine federal taxable income.Under current law, corporate taxpayers in Colorado are allowed to carry forward their net operating loss deduction for the same number of years as allowed for a federal net operating loss. For many years, taxpayers were limited to a 20-year carryforward period for both state and federal taxes. The federal ""Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"" (TCJA), enacted in 2017, allowed federal taxpayers unlimited years to carry forward net operating losses. Because Colorado's statute specifies that net operating losses may be carried forward ""for the same number of years as allowed for a federal net operating loss"", the TCJA's change resulted in the same change to Colorado's law. The act partially decouples the corporate net operating loss deduction from the federal net operating loss deduction by returning the state's carryforward period to 20 years for net operating losses generated in income tax years commencing on or after January 1, 2021.The act also repeals a state provision that was effective only for financial institutions, so that, for purposes of the period of years a loss can be carried forward, financial institutions will now be treated the same as any other taxpayer.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as enacted.)Read More",Session:2020 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeAdrienne BenavidezRepresentativeMarc SnyderSenatorDominick Moreno

The federal ""Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"", which became law in December 2017, qualified distributions for elementary or secondary public, private, or religious school tuition expenses. On the federal level, this allowed income tax-free distributions for certain elementary and secondary education expenses in addition to already authorized income tax-free distributions for higher education expenses.The bill makes similar changes to Colorado law to allow a deduction for contributions to qualified state tuition programs for elementary or secondary public, private, or religious school tuition expenses. Designating such expenses as qualified distributions ensures that a taxpayer does not encounter tax recapture of any claimed deductions when such contributions are distributed for elementary or secondary public, private, or religious school tuition expenses.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)Read More",Session:2020 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeColin Larson

1662,HB20-1043,Income Tax Credit For Early Childhood Education Fix,"During the first regular session of the seventy-second general assembly, the Senate passed House Bill 19-1005 on third reading on May 3, 2019, and the governor signed the bill on May 13, 2019. Because of an amendment to the effective date clause, the bill never took effect.The bill was introduced with a standard act-subject-to-petition clause (ASP clause), meaning the bill would have taken effect on August  2, 2019, unless a referendum petition was filed against the bill. However, on April 26, 2019, the House Appropriations Committee adopted an amendment (L.010) that added an exception to the ASP clause. The amendment specified that ""If the voters at the November 2019 statewide election do not approve a measure . . ., then this act takes effect on the date of the official declaration of the vote thereon by the governor.""When L.010 was adopted, House Bill 19-1333 was being considered. House Bill 19-1333 created a ballot issue that, if approved by voters, would have allowed the state to increase the cigarette tax and increase the tobacco products tax, would have allowed the state to create a new tax on nicotine products, and would have used a significant portion of the tax revenue for preschool programs and expanded learning opportunities. The concept behind L.010 was that if the ballot issue obtained voter approval, then the tax credit for early childhood educators would not be necessary.However, on May 2, 2019, the Senate postponed House Bill 19-1333 indefinitely during second reading. Since House Bill 19-1333 never passed, voters were never given an opportunity to approve the ballot issue, and the governor never had an opportunity to declare a vote on it. Consequently, because of the way L.010 was written, House Bill 19-1005 never took effect.In order to give effect to the intent of the general assembly and the governor in approving House Bill 19-1005, the exception to the effective date needs to be repealed.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)Read More",Session:2020 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeJanet BucknerRepresentativeJames  WilsonSenatorNancy ToddSenatorKevin Priola
1663,HB20-1044,Modify Pension Plans Administered By FPPA Fire And Police Pension Association,"The act modifies various plans administered by the fire and police pension association (FPPA).The act modifies the state-assisted old hire pension plans as follows:There are 26 state-assisted old hire police officers' and firefighters' pension plans with 5 or fewer retirees or beneficiaries who are still receiving benefits. Current law states that the amount of annual local government contributions to those plans is an amount that will amortize the unfunded liabilities of the plan over a period not to exceed 20 years or the average remaining life expectancy of the pension fund's members. Section 1 of the act modifies the method by which the contribution is calculated to more precisely set contribution requirements as the plans' liabilities decrease. The act allows the FPPA board of directors (board) to consider the following when determining the contribution amount: Stabilizing the amount of the annual required contributions over time; keeping the funded ratio of the pension fund from declining; and reducing or eliminating contributions as may be prudent based on actuarial experience.The act modifies the statewide defined benefit plan as follows:Increase in employee and employer contributions: Current statute specifies that all members covered under the statewide defined benefit plan administered by the FPPA contribute 8% of their salary to the FPPA on a monthly basis. In addition, every employer employing members who are covered by the statewide defined benefit plan administered by the FPPA contributes 8% of the salary paid to such members to the FPPA on a monthly basis.In 2014, the members and employers of the statewide defined benefit plan authorized a 4% increase in the member contribution rate to be implemented over 8 years with an increase of 0.5% per year for a total employee contribution rate of 12% of salary. The first 0.5% increase in the member contribution rate occurred in 2015 and the member contribution rate will continue to increase by 0.5% each year thereafter through 2022. Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the act codify the increases in the member contribution rates that are already in effect and make required conforming amendments.Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the act increase the employer contribution rate by 4%, to be implemented over 8 years with an increase of 0.5% a year for a total employer contribution rate of 12% of salary. The act requires the first 0.5% increase in the employer contribution rate to occur in 2021 and requires an additional 0.5% increase each year thereafter through 2028.Retirement eligibility: Currently, a member of the statewide defined benefit plan may retire with a full retirement benefit if the member has completed at least 25 years of service and is at least 55 years old. A member of the statewide defined benefit plan is eligible for an early retirement with a reduced benefit if the member has either completed at least 30 years of service or is at least 50 years old. Section 2 of the act allows a member of the statewide defined benefit plan to retire with an unreduced retirement benefit if the member is at least 50 years old and has a combined age and years of service that is equal to at least 80.To cover the cost of the new full retirement benefit eligibility, section 2 of the act increases the employer contribution rate, in addition to all other increases in the employer contribution rate, by 1% of base salary to be implemented over 2 years. In 2021, the act requires the employer contribution rate to increase by 0.5% of base salary and in 2022, requires the employer contribution rate to increase by an additional 0.5% of base salary. The implementation of the increase may be deferred while other increases are being implemented.Conforming amendment to current plan: Originally, the pension benefit for members of the statewide defined benefit plan was capped at 50% of a member's highest average salary, even when the member earned more than 25 years of service credit. In the 1990s, the cap was eliminated by an amendment to the plan approved by election of the members and employers. Sections 3 and 4 of the act eliminate the cap to conform to the current plan benefits.Stabilization reserve account: When the statewide defined benefit plan was initially established, the revenue generated from the 8% member contribution rate and the 8% employer contribution rate was more than necessary to pay the normal costs of the defined benefit plan. Any money in excess of what was necessary to pay the normal costs of the plan was deposited into the stabilization reserve account. The stabilization reserve account consists of separate retirement accounts and upon retirement, members who have satisfied the vesting requirements of the plan are eligible for distributions from the account.Since the stabilization reserve account was established, benefits allowed under the statewide defined benefit plan have increased to the extent that all of the revenue generated from the member and employer contributions are required to pay the normal costs of the plan and money is no longer deposited into the stabilization reserve account. Sections 3, 5, and 6 of the act change the nature of the separate retirement accounts in the stabilization reserve account to defined contribution accounts, subject to self direction by the member. In addition, the act requires the board to transfer the balances of the separate retirement accounts in the stabilization reserve account to defined contribution accounts by a specified date.Authorization to increase contribution rate: Current law authorizes the board to increase the member contribution rate for members in the statewide defined benefit plan. Section 7 of the act authorizes the board to increase the member and employer contribution rates in equal amounts above the rates established pursuant to law or eliminate an increase in the member and employer contribution rates if certain specified conditions are satisfied, including approval by members and employers at an election proposing such increase or decrease.Continuing rate of contribution: Pursuant to current law, any county that does not cover, under the federal ""Social Security Act"", salaried employees whose duties are directly involved with the provision of law enforcement or fire protection may elect coverage under the statewide defined benefit plan and the statewide death and disability plan. Section 9 of the act specifies that the board may determine a continuing rate of contribution for all members who are active on the effective date of coverage to fund benefits to ensure that the affiliating employers' coverage does not have an adverse financial impact on the actuarial soundness of the plan.Employers that have withdrawn from the statewide defined benefit plan but later reenter the plan are required to pay a continuing rate of contribution for all members who are active on the effective date of coverage. The continuing rate of contribution is a contribution in addition to the member and employer contribution and accounts for increased costs associated with members employed by employers who reenter the plan. The board established the continuing rate of contribution pursuant to law; however, the rate set by the board was higher than necessary to pay the costs of benefits for impacted members and current law does not authorize the board to decrease the rate. Section 12 of the act authorizes the board to decrease the continuing rate of contribution when it determines that the rate is higher than what is necessary to pay the costs of the benefits of members who are employees of employers who rejoined the plan.The act modifies the death and disability plan as follows:For members hired on or after January 1, 1997, and who are eligible for death and disability coverage provided by the FPPA, current law requires a contribution to the death and disability account not to exceed 2.4% of the members salary; except that the board is authorized to increase the contribution rate every 2 years by 0.1%. The current rate is 2.8% of salary. Sections 8, 10, and 11 of the act increase the maximum contribution rate in 2021 to 3% of salary and authorize the board to increase the contribution every year by up to 0.2% of the member's salary.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as enacted.)Read More",Session:2020 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeShannon BirdRepresentativeAlec GarnettSenatorLeroy GarciaSenatorJoann Ginal

1695,HB20-1076,Regulation Of Claims Against Insurance Companies By Insured Parties,"The bill states that if an insurer or an insured party requests an administrative hearing concerning an allegation that an insurer has breached the terms of an enforceable policy or other contract:The commissioner of insurance (commissioner) shall hold the hearing not later than 60 days after receiving the request;Neither the commissioner nor the division nor any administrative court may impose or require a fee of any party in association with the hearing;The commissioner shall conduct the hearing pursuant to the Colorado rules of procedure for small claims courts;The commissioner shall issue a ruling, and the ruling is not subject to appeal and does not prevent de novo judicial proceedings;If the commissioner determines, pursuant to the hearing, that the insurer has breached the terms of an enforceable policy or other contract, the commissioner may award treble damages and attorney fees to the insured party; andAny determination made by the commissioner, the division of insurance, or an administrative law judge pursuant to the hearing is admissible as evidence in any subsequent civil action.The bill states that in any civil action in which a plaintiff claims that an insurer wrongfully denied a claim submitted by the plaintiff pursuant to an enforceable policy issued by the insurer to the plaintiff:The court shall not charge the plaintiff any fee to recover costs associated with a jury trial; andThe defendant insurer may not file a motion for summary judgment, a directed verdict, a judgment on the pleadings, or any other alternative outcome if the plaintiff has requested a jury trial.The bill states that in any civil action in which the trier of fact determines that an insurer wrongfully denied a claim submitted by a plaintiff pursuant to an enforceable policy issued by the insurer to the plaintiff, that the insurer denied the claim in bad faith, and that the plaintiff suffered damages as a result of the wrongful denial, the court shall award treble damages, court costs, and attorney fees to the plaintiff.The bill states that it is an unfair method of competition and an unfair or deceptive act or practice in the business of insurance for an insurer to unilaterally change or cancel, or attempt to unilaterally change or cancel, the terms of a prepaid policy of insurance until the policy is due for renewal.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)Read More",Session:2020 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeDave Williams
1696,HB20-1077,Modifications Of County Treasurer Duties,"The act modifies the authority and duties of the county treasurer (treasurer) of each county.Treasurer's fees: The treasurer is required to charge and receive fees on all money received for town and city taxes. Current law also specifies that the fee for the collection of specific ownership taxes shall not be charged by the treasurer, as the fee is charged when the specific ownership tax is collected by the authorized agent. Section 1 of the act clarifies that the requirement to charge fees does not apply to the collection of specific ownership taxes.In addition, section 1 makes the fees that the treasurer is required to charge for research consistent with the fees charged pursuant to the ""Colorado Open Records Act"", and sections 1 and 14 make the fee charged for issuing an authentication of paid ad valorem taxes and a transportable manufactured home permit discretionary.Deputy treasurer: Current law authorizes a treasurer to appoint a deputy treasurer as necessary. Section 2 authorizes a treasurer to appoint a chief deputy and specifies that the chief deputy treasurer performs the duties of the treasurer if the treasurer is unable to perform such duties or if there is a vacancy in the treasurer's office.Receipts: Each treasurer is required to issue a receipt upon payment of any money to him or her. Sections 3 and 11 specify that if a person who has paid taxes wants a receipt for payment of taxes, the person shall request a receipt and the treasurer is required to issue such receipt upon request.Keeping a cash book: Current law requires each treasurer to keep a cash book with a record of every financial transaction in which the treasurer is involved. Section 4 repeals this requirement, as it is redundant to another statutory provision that requires each treasurer to keep a just and true account of the receipt and expenditure of all money that comes in or goes out of the treasurer's office.Definition of treasurer: For county purposes, ""treasurer"" is defined as the elected treasurer of a county or his or her appointed successor. However, the Weld county treasurer is appointed pursuant to the county's charter rather than elected. Section 5 modifies the definition of treasurer to include the treasurer or equivalent officer, as provided in the county's charter, for any home rule county.Conveyance of property: Current law specifies when the grantee or grantor of a conveyance of property will pay the taxes levied on the property if the conveyance does not include an express agreement regarding which party will pay the taxes due. Section 6 clarifies that this provision applies only when the property conveyed is not personal property, which is addressed in another provision of law. In addition, section 9 repeals obsolete language that required the treasurer to waive personal property tax obligations resulting from any conveyance, relocation, or change in tax status of the property that were not in the process of collection as of a certain date.Notice of property tax exemption: By specified dates each year, each county assessor and treasurer is required to mail certain mailings or notices to each residential real property address in the county. Section 7 specifies that if the county assessor or treasurer has reasonable certainty that such a notice will not be delivered to a residential real property address by the United States postal service, the county assessor and treasurer are not required to send the notice to that address.Declarations: Current law allows the treasurer to assess and tax any taxable property located in the treasurer's county if the property was omitted from the county assessor's tax list and warrant. Current law also requires public utilities in the state and the operators or owners of oil and gas leaseholds in the state to file with the property tax administrator or the county assessor, respectively, certain statements regarding their property. The statements are confidential and are currently not available to the treasurers. The treasurer, however, may need access to these statements if property owned by the public utility or the oil and gas leaseholds are omitted from the tax list and warrant. Sections 8 and 10 specify that such statements filed with the property tax administrator and the county assessor are available to the treasurer.Notice of school district mill levy: Current law requires each person whose name appears on the tax list and warrant to be informed in writing of specified information regarding the school district general fund mill levy. Section 12 modifies this provision to require the school district mill levy information be included on every tax notice.Estimated payment of tax: Current statute does not authorize a treasurer to accept an early payment of tax. Section 13 allows a treasurer to accept an estimated prepayment of property taxes due for the current tax year prior to the treasurer's receipt of the tax warrant. Section 13 also gives the treasurer broad authority to establish the conditions and terms under which estimated prepayments will be accepted.Tax liens on mobile homes: Current law specifies that a mobile home that is sold may be redeemed by the owner if certain criteria are satisfied. Section 15 modifies this provision to also allow the mobile home to be redeemed if it is stricken off to the county.When a mobile home has been purchased by the county at a tax sale and the assessor has determined that the actual value of the mobile home is less than $1,000, current law requires the treasurer to declare the mobile home condemned and to dispose of the mobile home at the end of the redemption period. Section 15 authorizes, rather than requires, the treasurer to condemn and dispose of the mobile home at the end of the redemption period.Personal property tax moving from county: Pursuant to current law, if the treasurer has reason to believe that personal property will be removed from the state, the treasurer may proceed with collections. Current law also states that if the county assessor reports that the property is moving out of the county, the treasurer is required to proceed with the collections process. Section 16 makes the 2 provisions consistent by referencing property moving out of the county in both instances and by allowing the treasurer to determine whether to proceed with collections in both instances.Abatement of taxes: Current law specifies that for abatements or refunds of taxes made pursuant to a petition for abatement or refund, interest accrues from the date a complete abatement petition is filed. Section 17 requires that beginning January 1, 2020, interest accrues from the date an abatement petition is filed or the date payment of taxes was received by the treasurer, whichever is later.Certification of taxes due: Upon request, a treasurer is required to certify the amount of taxes due as shown in the records of the treasurer's office or the records of the department of revenue. Current law specifies that a certificate signed by the treasurer showing payment of all taxes due is conclusive evidence that the taxes have been paid, without distinguishing between taxes owed to the treasurer and taxes owed to the department of revenue. Section 18 specifies that a certificate signed by the treasurer is conclusive evidence that only the taxes owed to the county have been paid.County held liens: Current law requires the treasurer, at least annually, to prepare and present to the board of county commissioners a list of all tax liens on all real property struck off to the county and all certificates of sale relating to the property if the certificates have been held by the county for 30 years or more without obtaining a deed or being otherwise disposed of. Section 19 changes this requirement to apply to certificates held by the county for 3 years to allow the board of county commissioners to take certain actions regarding the property at an earlier date.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as enacted.)Read More",Session:2020 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeJanice RichRepresentativeDonald ValdezSenatorChris Holbert

1715,HB20-1096,Authorize Protected Series Of Limited Liability Company,"In response to the growing popularity of series limited liability companies (series LLCs) in the United States, in 2017 the Uniform Law Commission promulgated the ""Uniform Protected Series Act"" (UPSA or  Act). The bill enacts the UPSA, effective January 1, 2021.Subpart 1 contains general provisions. The UPSA uses the term ""protected series"" to highlight the internal liability shields that are a defining characteristic of the Act, and to avoid confusion with the term ""series"", which is often used to refer to classes of interests in business entities that do not affect liabilities to third parties. If the requirements of the UPSA are satisfied, then assets of one protected series (referred to as ""associated assets"") are not available to satisfy claims of creditors of the LLC or of other protected series of the series LLC.Subpart 2 explains how to establish a protected series. Subpart 3 includes the record-keeping requirements that must be satisfied for an asset to qualify as an ""associated asset"" under the Act. Subpart 3 also provides rules for associating members with a protected series and addresses series transferable interests, management, and nonassociated members' rights to information.Subpart 4 covers limitations on liability and enforcement of claims. The Act provides 2 types of liability shields: Vertical and horizontal. The traditional vertical shield protects equity holders and managers from status-based liability for an organization's obligations. The horizontal shield protects a protected series of a series LLC and its associated assets from liability for the debts, obligations, and other liabilities of the company or of another protected series of the company. A creditor may enforce a judgment against another protected series of a series LLC by pursuing assets owned by the company or by another protected series of the company if the UPSA's requirements are not satisfied for these other assets (or ""nonassociated assets"").Subpart 5 addresses grounds for dissolution and provisions for winding up. Subpart 6 includes restrictions on mergers and other entity transactions involving series LLCs and protected series. Subpart 7 addresses foreign protected series.

Counties maintain the profile and surface condition of such county roads and county road rights-of-way by engaging in routine and emergency maintenance activities that do not disturb more than 6 inches in depth. These maintenance activities currently trigger the excavation notification requirement, and the related requirement that the location of underground facilities be marked, even though they occur above the levels where underground facilities are located.

The ""marriage penalty"" was addressed by Congress in 2003, so the deductions are no longer necessary.Repeals an income tax credit for estate taxes paid on the transfer of agricultural land. The Colorado estate tax is effectively zero because it is based on a federal credit in the provisions of the federal estate tax. The federal provision for the credit is not allowed for estates of decedents who passed away after December 31, 2004. Because the federal credit has not been extended, there is no state estate tax, and thus the income tax credit is not useable.Addresses some circular cross references within the statutory section.Corrects an issue in statute that erroneously requires nonresident beneficiaries to prepay income tax twice, once through estimated payments and again through tax withheld by the fiduciary.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as enacted.)Read More",Session:2020 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeDonald ValdezSenatorJack Tate

1815,HB20-1196,Mobile Home Park Act Updates,"The act makes various changes and additions to the existing ""Mobile Home Park Act"" and ""Mobile Home Park Act Dispute Resolution and Enforcement Program"" (program).The act clarifies provisions relating to notices that the management of a mobile home park (management) is required to provide to a home owner in the mobile home park (home owner) when management intends to terminate the home owner's tenancy in the mobile home park (park). The time a home owner has to cure certain instances of noncompliance is increased from 30 days to 90 days, and this 90-day period to cure runs concurrently with the period to sell the mobile home or remove it from the premises, which is increased from 60 to 90 days.The act restates, with amendments, the permissible reasons for which management may terminate a home owner's tenancy and the notice requirements associated with a termination. Currently, management may terminate a home owner's tenancy if the homeowner's conduct constitutes an annoyance to other homeowners or interference with management. The act eliminates this as a permissible reason for termination of tenancy. When a landlord intends to change the use of the land on which a park sits, and the change will result in eviction of the home owners, the amount of prior notice that the landlord is required to provide to the home owners is increased from 6 months to 12 months. A notice to quit tenancy and a notice of nonpayment of rent must include language notifying a home owner of the home owner's right to file a complaint through the program.Currently, management may charge an amount up to 2 month's rent as a security deposit for a multiwide unit. The act reduces the amount to no more than one month's rent.The act clarifies management's duties concerning maintenance and repair of a park and creates new duties relating to the maintenance and repair of water, sewer, and other utility service lines or related connections. Management must annually provide certain information concerning water usage and billing to home owners and post the information in a clearly visible location in at least one common area of the park. If management charges home owners for water usage in the park, management must provide each home owner a monthly water bill showing the amount owed by the home owner, the total amount owed by all home owners in the park, the methodologies used to determine the amount billed to each home owner, and, if management purchases the water from a provider, the total amount paid by management to the provider.The act prohibits management from taking retaliatory action against a home owner who exercises any right conferred upon the home owner by law. An action by management is presumed to be retaliatory if the action was taken within 120 days after the home owner made an effort to secure or enforce the home owner's rights, and management may rebut a presumption of retaliation with sufficient evidence that an action was taken against the home owner for a nonretaliatory purpose.The act allows management to add or amend rules and regulations only after acquiring the consent of each home owner or after providing written notice of the amendment to each home owner at least 60 days before the amendment becomes effective. A home owner may file a complaint challenging a rule, regulation, or amendment pursuant to the program within 60 days after receiving the notice. If a home owner files a complaint, and the new or amended rule or regulation will increase a cost to the home owner in an amount equal to or exceeding 10% of the home owner's monthly rent obligation under the rental agreement, management may not enforce the rule, regulation, or amendment unless and until the parties reach an agreement concerning the rule, regulation, or amendment or the dispute resolution process concludes with a written determination that the rule, regulation, or amendment may be enforced.The act requires management to respect the privacy of home owners. Management has a right of entry to the land upon which a mobile home is situated for the maintenance of utilities and to ensure compliance with applicable codes, statutes, ordinances, administrative rules, rental agreements, and the rules of the community. A landlord shall not make entry in a manner that interferes with a home owner's peaceful enjoyment of the land except in the case of an emergency. Except when posting notices that are required by law or by a rental agreement, management shall make a reasonable effort to notify a home owner of management's intention to make entry at least 48 hours before making entry.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as enacted.)Read More",Session:2020 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeEdie HootonRepresentativeJulie McCluskieSenatorStephen FenbergSenatorPete Lee

The bill requires the signed affidavit to be filed with the court instead of the receipt. Both the signed affidavit and written statement are only available for inspection by the court and the parties to the proceeding.A federally licensed firearms dealer, law enforcement agency, or private party that elects to store a firearm is not civilly liable for any resulting damages to the firearm, as long as such damage did not result from the willful and wrongful act or gross negligence of the person or agency storing the firearm.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)Read More",Session:2020 Regular Session,Prime SponsorsRepresentativeMonica DuranRepresentativeJonathan SingerSenatorRhonda Fields
