Hello and thank you for taking the time to view my Project 2 from INFO 3510 -
Music as Information.

This project revolves around making a Discord bot that can be used to expand
one's music tastes.

There are a total of nine functions associated with the bot.
Seven of them are ones that a user interacts with.

Below are the functions that are displayed once a user joins the discord server
(when the kernel is running of course)


'/sayhello member'
'/getRecs artist' 
'/getRecsByCountry country' 
'/plotSingers artist'
'/getLyrics song, artist' 
'/getArtistId artist' 
'/getArtistInfo artistId'

One more thing, I am using the last.fm api for many of these functions.
Those that wish to run my code require the last.fm api key
